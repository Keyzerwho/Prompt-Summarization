You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days.

Every day decrement the positive element with the least index that is not the first element. After that increment the element that precedes it. 

If no such element exists do nothing.

Return the value of the first element after $d$ days.

-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$)  — the number of test cases. Next $2t$ lines contain a description of test cases  — two lines per test case.

The first line of each test case contains integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n,d \le 100$) — the number of integers in each array and the number of days, respectively. 

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 100$)  — the integers in the array.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum value of the first element if we take optimal action each day.
