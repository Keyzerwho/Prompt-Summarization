You are given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You should find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex covers or claim it's impossible. Input: The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph, respectively. Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n), denoting an undirected edge between u_{i} and v_{i}. Output: If it's impossible to split the graph, print "-1" (without quotes). If there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer k denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains k integers — the indices of vertices. Examples: Input 4 2 1 2 2 3 Output 1 2 2 1 3 Input 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 Output -1
