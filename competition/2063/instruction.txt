You are given n sets which are a subset of the set of natural numbers in the range 1 to m. You can add a single number to any one set at the cost 1.

Find the minimum total cost such that for every pair of sets the union is not a null set.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of sets and the range of natural numbers.

The next n lines that follow - the sets containing the natural numbers in range 1 to m. If the input is zero it is a null set.

The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum cost such that the union of no two pairs is a null set.
