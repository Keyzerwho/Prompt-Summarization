You are given two integers X and d. You should construct an array such that, removing all non-empty subsequences in which Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence - Minimum_element_of_subsequence ≥ d from the set of all subsequences will give you X subsequences. Input: The only line of input consists of two space separated integers X and d (1 ≤ X, d ≤ 10^9). Output: Output should consist of two lines. First line should contain a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000)— the number of integers in the final array. Second line should consist of n space separated integers — a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} < 10^18). If there is no answer, print a single integer -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Examples: Input 10 5 Output 6 5 50 7 15 6 100 Input 4 2 Output 4 10 100 1000 10000
