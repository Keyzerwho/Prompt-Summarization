You are given N coordinates on the xy-plane.

A given compass can point to (p,q) or (p,r) when d(p,q) = d(p,r) where d is the Manhattan distance.

Initially, you are at (a,b) coordinates. You need to find the number of pairs of coordinates such that the compass can point.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2≦N≦10^5
 - 1≦x_i, y_i≦10^9
 - 1≦a < b≦N
 - When i ≠ j, (x_i, y_i) ≠ (x_j, y_j)
 - x_i and y_i are integers.

-----Input-----
The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N a b
x_1 y_1
:
x_N y_N

-----Output-----
Print the number of the pairs of pinholes that can be pointed by the compass.

-----Sample Input-----
5 1 2
1 1
4 3
6 1
5 5
4 8

-----Sample Output-----
4

Initially, the compass points at the first and second pinholes.
Since d(1,2) = d(1,3), the compass can be moved so that it will point at the first and third pinholes.
Since d(1,3) = d(3,4), the compass can also point at the third and fourth pinholes.
Since d(1,2) = d(2,5), the compass can also point at the second and fifth pinholes.
No other pairs of pinholes can be pointed by the compass, thus the answer is 4.
