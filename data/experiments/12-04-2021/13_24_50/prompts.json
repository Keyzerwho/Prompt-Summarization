The original order need to be preserved.\n\n# Examples\n\nperformant_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)     ==   [1, 2, 3]\nperformant_smallest([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)     ==   [3, 2, 1]\nperformant_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 1], 3)     ==   [1, 2, 1]\nperformant_smallest([2, 1, 3, 2, 3], 3)     ==   [2, 1, 2]\n\n\"\"\"\ndef performant_smallest(arr, n):",
    "19": "Python 3\n\"\"\"\nThis challenge is based on [the kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/n-smallest-elements-in-original-order) by GiacomoSorbi. Before doing this one it is advisable to complete the non-performance version first.\n\n___\n\n# Task\n\nYou will be given an array of random integers and a number `n`. You have to extract `n` smallest integers out of it **preserving the original order**.\n\n# Examples\n\n```python\nperformant_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)     ==   [1, 2, 3]\nperformant_smallest([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)     ==   [3, 2, 1]\nperformant_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 1], 3)     ==   [1, 2, 1]\nperformant_smallest([2, 1, 3, 2, 3], 3)     ==   [2, 1, 2]\n```\n\n# Notes\n\n* There will be duplicates in the array, and they have to be returned in the order of their each separate appearence.\n* This kata is an example of the \"know your data\" principle. Remember this while searching for the correct approach.\n\n# Performance tests\n\n```python\nTests: 15\nArray size: 800,000\nValues range: [1; 50]\nNumber of elements to return: 25-50% of the array\n```\n\"\"\"\ndef performant_smallest(arr, n):"
