Fouriest transformations are harder.\n\nThis Kata is based on the SMBC Comic on fourier transformations.\n\nA fourier transformation on a number is one that converts the number to a base in which it has more `4`s ( `10` in base `6` is `14`, which has `1` four as opposed to none, hence, fourier in base `6` ).\n\nA number's fouriest transformation converts it to the base in which it has the most `4`s.  \nFor example: `35353` is the fouriest in base `6`: `431401`.\n\nThis kata requires you to create a method `fouriest` that takes a number and makes it the fouriest, telling us in which base this happened, as follows:\n\n```python\nfouriest(number) -> \"{number} is the fouriest ({fouriest_representation}) in base {base}\"\n```\n\n## Important notes\n\n* For this kata we don't care about digits greater than `9` ( only `0` to `9` ), so we will represent all digits greater than `9` as `'x'`: `10` in base `11` is `'x'`, `119` in base `20` is `'5x'`, `118` in base `20` is also `'5x'`\n\n* When a number has several fouriest representations, we want the one with the LOWEST base\n\n```if:haskell,javascript\n* Numbers below `9` will not be tested\n```\n\n```if:javascript\n* A `BigNumber` library has been provided; documentation is [here](https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/)\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\n\"30 is the fouriest (42) in base 7\"\n\"15 is the fouriest (14) in base 11\"\n```\n\"\"\"\ndef fouriest(i):",

One group of such algorithms is based on reduction and elimination methods. If you are going to use any of these, remember that such algorithms are in general *numerically unstable*, i.e. division operations repeated over and over introduce inaccuracies which accumulate from row to row. As a result it might occur that some value which is expected to be zero is actually larger, for example, `2.5e-10`. Such inaccuracies tend to be bigger in large equation systems, and random tests check systems of up to 26 equations. If it happens that small tests pass for you, and large tests fail, it probably means that you did not account for inaccuracies correctly.\nAlso note that tests do not depend on any reference solution, so the way how test cases are generated _is numerically stable_ - the only source of inaccuracies is your solution, and you need to account for it.\n\n```if:python\n___Note for python users:___\n\n`numpy` module has been disabled, so that the task matches the one of the other languages.

The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element.\n\nHe wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$).\n\nEach test case contains exactly one line, consisting of an integer and a string consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The integer is $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$), the length of the permutation you need to find. The string is the comparison results explained in the description. The length of the string is $n-1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ in all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print two lines with $n$ integers each. The first line is the sequence with the minimum length of the LIS, and the second line is the sequence with the maximum length of the LIS. If there are multiple answers, print any one of them. Each sequence should contain all integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, and should satisfy the comparison results.\n\nIt can be shown that at least one answer always exists.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 <<\n7 >><>><\n5 >>><\n\nOutput\n1 2 3\n1 2 3\n5 4 3 7 2 1 6\n4 3 1 7 5 2 6\n4 3 2 1 5\n5 4 2 1 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, $1$ $2$ $3$ is the only possible answer.\n\nIn the second case, the shortest length of the LIS is $2$, and the longest length of the LIS is $3$. In the example of the maximum LIS sequence, $4$ '$3$' $1$ $7$ '$5$' $2$ '$6$' can be one of the possible LIS.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
