The polygon formed from all the $n$ points is strictly convex, that is, the polygon is convex, and there are no three collinear points (i.e. lying in the same straight line). The points are numbered from $1$ to $n$, in clockwise order.\n\nWe define the distance between two points $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ as their Manhattan distance: $$d(p_1, p_2) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|.$$\n\nFurthermore, we define the perimeter of a polygon, as the sum of Manhattan distances between all adjacent pairs of points on it; if the points on the polygon are ordered as $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k$ $(k \\geq 3)$, then the perimeter of the polygon is $d(p_1, p_2) + d(p_2, p_3) + \\ldots + d(p_k, p_1)$.\n\nFor some parameter $k$, let's consider all the polygons that can be formed from the given set of points, having any $k$ vertices, such that the polygon is not self-intersecting. For each such polygon, let's consider its perimeter.

The correct way to draw this polygon is ($p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$), which is the left polygon.\n\nYour task is to compute $f(3), f(4), \\ldots, f(n)$.

You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \\le x \\le 10^9$; $1 \\le y, k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n2 1 5\n42 13 24\n12 11 12\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n2 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutput\n14\n33\n25\n2000000003\n1000000001999999999\n\"\"\"\ndef code():",
