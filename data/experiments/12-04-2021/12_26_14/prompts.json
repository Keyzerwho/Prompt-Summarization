    "19": "Python 3\n\"\"\"\nCengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named XORinacci numbers. He defined them as follows:   $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \\oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. \n\nYou are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$.\n\nYou have to answer for $T$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input contains one or more independent test cases.\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \\le T \\le 10^3$), the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the $T$ following lines contains three space-separated integers $a$, $b$, and $n$ ($0 \\le a, b, n \\le 10^9$) respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output $f(n)$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n3 4 2\n4 5 0\n325 265 1231232\n\nOutput\n7\n4\n76\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, $f(2) = f(0) \\oplus f(1) = 3 \\oplus 4 = 7$.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
