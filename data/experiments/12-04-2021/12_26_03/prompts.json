The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 200\\,000$): the length of $a$. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq n-1$).\n\nThe total sum of $n$ is less than $200\\,000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, the first line of output should contain one integer $k$: the number of ways to divide $a$ into permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$.\n\nEach of the next $k$ lines should contain two integers $l_1$ and $l_2$ ($1 \\leq l_1, l_2 \\leq n, l_1 + l_2 = n$), denoting, that it is possible to divide $a$ into two permutations of length $l_1$ and $l_2$ ($p_1$ is the first $l_1$ elements of $a$, and $p_2$ is the last $l_2$ elements of $a$). You can print solutions in any order.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n5\n1 4 3 2 1\n6\n2 4 1 3 2 1\n4\n2 1 1 3\n4\n1 3 3 1\n12\n2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 10 2\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n1 4\n4 1\n1\n4 2\n0\n0\n1\n2 10\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, two possible ways to divide $a$ into permutations are $\\{1\\} + \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$ and $\\{1,4,3,2\\} + \\{1\\}$.\n\nIn the second example, the only way to divide $a$ into permutations is $\\{2,4,1,3\\} + \\{2,1\\}$.\n\nIn the third example, there are no possible ways.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():",
