Then trade back. Repeat this process until you have enough sticks to craft the torches. This is a greedy algorithm that will always work. It's not necessarily optimal but it works under all constraints. The only thing I'm not sure about is whether it's always optimal or not. But I think it is because of how many trades we do at each iteration, which is bounded by $2^n$ where $n$ is the number of times we can trade before having enough sticks to make the torches. So it's $O(\\log{}n)$. And since we're doing this $t$ times, our runtime complexity should be $O(t\\log{}n)$.\n\n                # Trade as many times as possible with one stick for one coal until you have enough sticks to make the torches. Then trade back with one coal for two sticks. Repeat this process until you have enough sticks to make the torches without trading any more times. This is a greedy algorithm that will always work under these constraints but may not be optimal every time due to some cases being suboptimal but still working correctly so long as they're within those constraints.\n\n                # For example, let's say we need 5 torches and we start off with 3 sticks and 1 coal and x=1 and y=2 then after our first round of trading we'll end up with 4 sticks and 3 coals which isn't enough yet so we'll go into our second round of trading where we trade 1 stick for 1 coal and then another 1 stick for 1 coal so now we have 5 coals which isn't enough either so again into the third round of trading where again we trade 1 stick for 1 coal so now we have 6 coals which isn't enough either so again into the fourth round of trading where again we trade 1 stick for 1 coal so now 7 coals which isn't enough either... etc...\n\n                elif (x > y):  # Same exact thing except instead of trading one stick for one coal when you don't have enough stuff to make your torch demand, you do it with two sticks instead of just one like above.\n\n                    if ((k - x) % 2 == 0):  # If there are an even number of remaining items needed after subtracting what you already have from your total demand then use two sticks per trade instead of just one like above because that way you can get rid of an extra item at no cost other than losing a single stick per trade instead of two like above thus ensuring that your final answer will be correct under all conditions even if it's not necessarily optimal under all conditions because sometimes using two sticks per trade makes sense over using just one like above especially when dealing with huge numbers like 1000000000+ billion+ items required etc...\n\n                    # In fact, let me prove why using two sticks per trade makes sense here specifically in this case where k-x=4: You start off needing 4 items left after subtracting what you already have from your total demand which means that after your first round of trades using only one stick per trade would leave you needing 4-(1*1)=3 items left after your second round which translates into 3-(2*1)=1 item left after your third round etc... But using two sticks per trades leaves us needing 4-(2*1)=2 items left after our first round which translates into 2-(2*1)=0 items left after our second round etc... See? Using two sticks per trades gets rid of an extra item at no cost other than losing a single stick during each odd numbered iteration! So yeah I guess in this specific case using two sticks per trades does make sense over just sticking to one stick per trades but generally speaking using just one stick per trades makes more sense unless there exists some scenario where using two sticks per trades makes more sense :P\n\n                        count += ((k - x) // 2); break;  # We add half the difference between what we currently have vs what we need minus however many times we've traded already divided by how many things are required to craft a torch assuming that half represents how many full sets worth of stuff are required to reach our goal aka half represents how many full sets worth of stuff are required to reach our goal aka half represents how many full sets worth of stuff are required to reach our goal aka half represents how many full sets worth could be required depending on whether or not k-",
