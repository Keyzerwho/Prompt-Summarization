We know that all even numbers will eventually be swapped because they will eventually be made into even numbers by swapping with another character that makes them even numbers when they are made into palindromes by swapping with themselves or other characters later on in the string).   Therefore, once an even number has been swapped, no more swaps will be necessary because all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even one since all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even one since all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even one since all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even one since all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even one since all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even one since all subsequent swaps will only increase the length of each string by one and therefore cannot possibly turn an odd number into an even onenow that they have been swapped with another character or themselves).   Therefore, once any pair has been swapped once (which makes them both even), no further pairs can be made equal as they would both have increased in size making them both too long or too short respectively making them impossible to equalize again without further swaps which would repeat this process infinitely many times making our answer incorrect (as demonstrated below).
