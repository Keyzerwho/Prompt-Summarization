Over all such perimeters, we define $f(k)$ to be the maximal perimeter.\n\nPlease note, when checking whether a polygon is self-intersecting, that the edges of a polygon are still drawn as straight lines. For instance, in the following pictures:\n\n [Image] \n\nIn the middle polygon, the order of points ($p_1, p_3, p_2, p_4$) is not valid, since it is a self-intersecting polygon. The right polygon (whose edges resemble the Manhattan distance) has the same order and is not self-intersecting, but we consider edges as straight lines. The correct way to draw this polygon is ($p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$), which is the left polygon.\n\nYour task is to compute $f(3), f(4), \\ldots, f(n)$. In other words, find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e. $3$ to $n$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\leq n \\leq 3\\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points. \n\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^8 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq 10^8$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinates of point $p_i$.\n\nThe set of points is guaranteed to be convex, all points are distinct, the points are ordered in clockwise order, and there will be no three collinear points.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each $i$ ($3\\leq i\\leq n$), output $f(i)$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n2 4\n4 3\n3 0\n1 3\n\nOutput\n12 14 \nInput\n3\n0 0\n0 2\n2 0\n\nOutput\n8 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, for $f(3)$, we consider four possible polygons:   ($p_1, p_2, p_3$), with perimeter $12$.  ($p_1, p_2, p_4$), with perimeter $8$.  ($p_1, p_3, p_4$), with perimeter $12$.  ($p_2, p_3, p_4$), with perimeter $12$. \n\nFor $f(4)$, there is only one option, taking all the given points. Its perimeter $14$.\n\nIn the second example, there is only one possible polygon. Its perimeter is $8$.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
