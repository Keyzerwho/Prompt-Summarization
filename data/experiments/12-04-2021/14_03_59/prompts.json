So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly $n$ jars to his left and $n$ jars to his right.\n\nFor example, the basement might look like this: [Image] \n\nBeing the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right.\n\nFinally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same.\n\nFor example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam. \n\nJars are numbered from $1$ to $2n$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $n$ and $n+1$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left?\n\nYour program should answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$).\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $2n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{2n}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2$) \u2014 $a_i=1$ means that the $i$-th jar from the left is a strawberry jam jar and $a_i=2$ means that it is a blueberry jam jar.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print the answer to it \u2014 the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n6\n1 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2\n2\n1 2 1 2\n3\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n2\n2 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n6\n0\n6\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe picture from the statement describes the first test case.\n\nIn the second test case the number of strawberry and blueberry jam jars is already equal.\n\nIn the third test case Karlsson is required to eat all $6$ jars so that there remain $0$ jars of both jams.\n\nIn the fourth test case Karlsson can empty either the second and the third jars or the third and the fourth one. The both scenarios will leave $1$ jar of both jams.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
