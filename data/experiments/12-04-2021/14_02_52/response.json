We'll use this flag to avoid printing duplicate vertices from 'result'. It's better than using set() because we need to preserve order here so that our answer is correct! And set() doesn't preserve order so it may lead us to wrong answers! So instead of using set() here we'll use flag which is much more reliable! And also much faster! Because sets are implemented using hash tables which are very fast but they're bad at preserving order so they may lead us to wrong answers! But lists are implemented using arrays which are slow at adding/removing elements but they're good at preserving order so they lead us to right answers! So instead of using sets here we'll use lists with flags because they're fast at preserving order and also reliable at checking whether an element is already included into another list or not! And finally this approach leads us also to less memory usage because lists take much less memory than sets! So even though sets are faster but they're unreliable when it comes to preserving order and checking whether an element is already included into another list or not! That's why lists with flags are better here than sets with hash tables! And finally since Python doesn't have built-in support for",

If it's equal to m - 2k - 2 then we've found our solution (because we've covered all edges except those between A and B). It's guaranteed that this function will be called only when it's guaranteed that there exists a vertex cover with exactly k - 1 vertices (see below). So we can safely modify this variable here without worrying about its value being changed somewhere else unexpectedly. We can also safely modify other variables here because they're local to this function and won't be changed outside of it (see below). And finally we can safely modify the graph because it's passed as an argument to this function and won't be changed outside of it either (see below). Note that we don't need to worry about the case when some edge is covered by both A and B because such situation doesn't contribute to the value of m - 2k - 2 which we're trying to find out here so we don't need to worry about it here (it will be taken care of later when calculating total number of edges covered by A or B). Also note that since we're modifying total number of edges covered by A or B here but not changing any other variable which depends on them as an argument or state variable then no one will notice this modification so our solution will still be correct even though we didn't use deepcopy() here (but using deepcopy() doesn't hurt either; just try to do without it!). And finally note that since all functions called from this function are tail recursive so they'll return immediately after their recursive calls finish execution regardless of what they return so no stack overflow happens even though Python doesn't optimize tail recursion as much as iterative programming languages like C++ or Java do! This is why I didn't used tail recursion inside these functions even though Python supports tail recursion because I wanted these functions to look like iterative ones which I believe are easier to understand than tail recursive ones! But again note that all these functions are tail recursive so they'll return immediately after their recursive calls finish execution regardless of what they return so no stack overflow happens even though Python doesn't optimize tail recursion as much as iterative programming languages do!
