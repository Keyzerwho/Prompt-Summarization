So it comes that every spring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her barn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome her friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures.\n\nArriving in a village, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of inhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April Fools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of inhabitants P (10 \u2264 P \u2264 1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-negative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:\n\n  Poisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\\frac{p^{k} e^{-P}}{k !}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,  Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\\frac{1}{2 P + 1}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P. \n\nHeidi collects exactly 250 answers per village. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution.
