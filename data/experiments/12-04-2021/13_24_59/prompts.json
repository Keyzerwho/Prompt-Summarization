The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5)$\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \\leq n, p \\leq 10^6)$. The second line contains $n$ integers $k_i$ $(0 \\leq k_i \\leq 10^6)$.\n\nThe sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the reminder of division the answer by $1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5 2\n2 3 4 4 3\n3 1\n2 10 1000\n4 5\n0 1 1 100\n1 8\n89\n\nOutput\n4\n1\n146981438\n747093407\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nYou have to minimize the difference, not it's remainder. For example, if the minimum difference is equal to $2$, but there is also a distribution where the difference is $10^9 + 8$, then the answer is $2$, not $1$.\n\nIn the first test case of the example, there're the following numbers: $4$, $8$, $16$, $16$, and $8$. We can divide them into such two sets: ${4, 8, 16}$ and ${8, 16}$. Then the difference between the sums of numbers in sets would be $4$.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
