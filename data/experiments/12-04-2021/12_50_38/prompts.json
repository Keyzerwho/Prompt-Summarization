She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{h}, where h is the height of the tree, and a_{i} equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of i edges from root. \n\nUnfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence a_{i}, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree.\n\nTwo rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal.\n\nThe height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer h (2 \u2264 h \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the height of the tree.\n\nThe second line contains h + 1 integers\u00a0\u2014 the sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{h} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 2\u00b710^5). The sum of all a_{i} does not exceed 2\u00b710^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one tree matching this sequence.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is only one tree matching this sequence, print \"perfect\".\n\nOtherwise print \"ambiguous\" in the first line. In the second and in the third line print descriptions of two trees in the following format: in one line print $\\sum_{i = 0}^{h} a_{i}$ integers, the k-th of them should be the parent of vertex k or be equal to zero, if the k-th vertex is the root.\n\nThese treese should be non-isomorphic and should match the given sequence.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\nperfect\n\nInput\n2\n1 2 2\n\nOutput\nambiguous\n0 1 1 3 3\n0 1 1 3 2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe only tree in the first example and the two printed trees from the second example are shown on the picture:\n\n$88$\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
