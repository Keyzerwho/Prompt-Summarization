After this new revolutionary discovery, he invented a game for kids which uses xor-trees.\n\nThe game is played on a tree having n nodes, numbered from 1 to n. Each node i has an initial value init_{i}, which is either 0 or 1. The root of the tree is node 1.\n\nOne can perform several (possibly, zero) operations on the tree during the game. The only available type of operation is to pick a node x. Right after someone has picked node x, the value of node x flips, the values of sons of x remain the same, the values of sons of sons of x flips, the values of sons of sons of sons of x remain the same and so on.\n\nThe goal of the game is to get each node i to have value goal_{i}, which can also be only 0 or 1. You need to reach the goal of the game by using minimum number of operations.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5).
