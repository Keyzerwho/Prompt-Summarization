If you do get a strike or spare on those bonus balls, they should only count as bonus *after* you get your next strike or spare! In other words, only count them as bonus *after* you get your next strike or spare! In other words, only count them as bonus *after* you get your next strike or spare! In other words, only count them as bonus *after* you get your next strike or spare! In other words... I hope that made sense :) Haha just kidding I'm sure it was extremely confusing :P . But hopefully this comment helped clear things up :) . If not I'll just have to make an illustration/diagram/graph/table/whatever... but I think this explanation was enought :) . So yeah... Bonus balls after strikes must only be counted as such *after* another strike or spare is thrown ;) . And also... Bonus balls after spares must only be counted as such *after* another spare is thrown ;) . And also... Bonus ball after open frames must only be counted as such *after* another open frame is thrown ;) . And also... Bonus ball after spares in last frame must only be counted as such *after* another spare is thrown ;) . And also... Bonus ball after strikes in last frame must only be counted as such *after* another strike is thrown ;) . And also... Bonus ball after strikes in last two frames must only be counted as such *after* another strike is thrown ;) . And also.. Bonus ball after strikes in last three frames must only be counted as such *after* another strike is thrown ;) . And also.. Bonus ball after strikes in last four frames must only be counted as such *after* another strike is thrown ;) . And also.. Bonus ball after strikes in last five frames must only be counts as such *after* another strike is thrown ;) ... You get the idea :) ... Hope that made sense :) ... Oh and by the way these rules apply to all frames except for the tenth one so yeah there might still exist edge cases where these rules don't apply 100% but I think they cover 99% of all possible cases :P ...
