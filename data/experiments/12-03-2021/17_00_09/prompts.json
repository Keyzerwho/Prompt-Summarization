There are 8 possible outcomes. Each has a probability of 0.125.  \"OOO\"  \u2192  3^2 = 9;  \"OOX\"  \u2192  2^2 = 4;  \"OXO\"  \u2192  1^2 + 1^2 = 2;  \"OXX\"  \u2192  1^2 = 1;  \"XOO\"  \u2192  2^2 = 4;  \"XOX\"  \u2192  1^2 = 1;  \"XXO\"  \u2192  1^2 = 1;  \"XXX\"  \u2192  0. \n\nSo the expected score is $\\frac{9 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1}{8} = 2.75$\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
