For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nYour are given n users name registered on the Polycarp's website using latin alphabets. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"oo\" and \"h\"\u00a0[Image]\u00a0\"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\".  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: \"khun\" $\\rightarrow$ \"khoon\" and \"kkkhoon\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kkhoon\" $\\rightarrow$ \"khoon\". \n\nFor a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer number n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 400) \u2014 number of the words in the list.\n\nThe following n lines contain words, one word per line. Each word consists of only lowercase Latin letters. The length of each word is between 1 and 20 letters inclusive.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n10\nmihail\noolyana\nkooooper\nhoon\nulyana\nkoouper\nmikhail\nkhun\nkuooper\nkkkhoon\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n9\nhariton\nhkariton\nbuoi\nkkkhariton\nboooi\nbui\nkhariton\nboui\nboi\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n2\nalex\nalex\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThere are four groups of words in the first example.
