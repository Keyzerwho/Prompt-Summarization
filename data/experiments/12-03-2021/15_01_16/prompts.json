Then the test cases follow. \n- Each test case contains a single line of input, $N$. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line answer.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n2\n5\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n1\n2\n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\nFor 1) Binary representation of 2 is 10. i.e. only one 1 present in it.\nFor 2) Binary representation of 5 is 101, i.e. two 1's present in it.\n\"\"\"\ndef code():"
