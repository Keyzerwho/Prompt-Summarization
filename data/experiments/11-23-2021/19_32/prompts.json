They wholeheartedly agree with the main message of the conference and they are delighted with all the new things they learn about brackets.\n\nOne of these things is a bracket sequence. If you want to do a computation with $+$ and $\\times $, you usually write it like so:\\[ (2 \\times (2 + 1 + 0 + 1) \\times 1) + 3 + 2. \\]\n\nThe brackets are only used to group multiplications and additions together. This means that you can remove all the operators, as long as you remember that addition is used for numbers outside any parentheses! A bracket sequence can then be shortened to\\[ (\\; 2 \\; ( \\; 2 \\; 1 \\; 0 \\; 1 \\; ) \\; 1 \\; ) \\; 3 \\; 2. \\]\n\nThat is much better, because it saves on writing all those operators. Reading bracket sequences is easy, too. Suppose you have the following bracket sequence\\[ 5 \\; 2 \\; (\\; 3 \\; 1 \\; (\\; 2 \\; 2 \\; ) \\; ( \\; 3 \\; 3 \\; ) \\; 1 \\; ). \\]\n\nYou start with addition, so this is the same as the following:\\[ 5 + 2 + (\\; 3 \\; 1 \\; (\\; 2 \\; 2 \\; ) \\; ( \\; 3 \\; 3 \\; ) \\; 1 \\; ). \\]\n\nYou know the parentheses group a multiplication, so this is equal to\\[ 5 + 2 + (3 \\times 1 \\times (\\; 2 \\; 2 \\; ) \\times ( \\; 3 \\; 3 \\; ) \\times 1). \\]\n\nThen there is another level of parentheses: that groups an operation within a multiplication, so the operation must be addition.\\[ 5 + 2 + (3 \\times 1 \\times (2 + 2 ) \\times (3 + 3) \\times 1 ) = 5 + 2 + (3 \\times 1 \\times 4 \\times 6 \\times 1) = 5+2 + 72 = 79. \\]\n\nSince bracket sequences are so much easier than normal expressions with operators, it should be easy to evaluate some big ones. We will even allow you to write a program to do it for you.\n\nNote that $(\\; )$ is not a valid bracket sequence, nor a subsequence of any valid bracket sequence.\n\n-----Input-----\n - One line containing a single integer $1\\leq n\\leq 3\\cdot 10^5$.\n - One line consisting of $n$ tokens, each being either (, ), or an integer $0\\leq x < 10^9+7$.

It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 70$, $n - 1 \\leq m \\leq 200$, $1 \\leq a < b \\leq 10^7$) \u2014 the number of settlements and gravel roads in Codefortia, and two possible travel times.
