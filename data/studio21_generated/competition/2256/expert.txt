 You are given 2 integers $n$ and $m$, and a cell field $n \cdot m$, consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns, where point's coordinates $(x, y)$ mean it is situated in the $x$-th row and $y$-th column, considering numeration from one ($1 \leq x \leq n, 1 \leq y \leq m$). Initially, you stand in the cell $(1, 1)$. Every move you can
-----Input----- The first and only line contains two positive integers $n, m$ ($1 \leq n \cdot m \leq 10^{6}$) — the number of rows and columns of the field respectively. -----Output----- Print "-1" (without quotes) if it is impossible to visit every cell exactly once. Else print $n \cdot m$ pairs of integers, $i$-th from them should contain two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($1 \leq x_i \leq n, 1 \leq y_i \leq m$) — cells of the field in order of visiting, so that all of them are distinct and vectors of jumps between them are distinct too. Notice that the first cell should have $(1, 1)$ coordinates, according to the statement. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 Output 1 1 1 3 1 2 2 2 2 3 2 1 Input 1 1 Output 1 1 -----Note----- The vectors from the first example in the order of making jumps are $(0, 2), (0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -2)$.
