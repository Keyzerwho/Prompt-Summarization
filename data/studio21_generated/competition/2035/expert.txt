 This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 35$)  — the number of dolls and the maximum value of the picking way. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i < 2^m$)  — the values of dolls. -----Output----- Print $m+1$ integers $p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_m$  — $p_i$ is equal to the number of picking ways with value $i$ by modulo $998\,244\,353$. -----Examples----- Input 4 4 3 5 8 14 Output 2 2 6 6 0  Input 6 7 11 45 14 9 19 81 Output 1 2 11 20 15 10 5 0
