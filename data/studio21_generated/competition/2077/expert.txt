 You are given a list of $n$ integers.  On each day you should add an element to A and subtract an element from B. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three space-separated integers n, a, b (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). The next line contains n space-separated distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- If there is a way to divide the numbers into two sets, then print "YES" in the first line. Then print n integers: b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (b_{i} equals either 0, or 1), describing the division. If b_{i} equals to 0, then p_{i} belongs to set A, otherwise it belongs to set B. If it's impossible, print "NO" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 4 5 9 2 3 4 5 Output YES 0 0 1 1 Input 3 3 4 1 2 4 Output NO -----Note----- It's OK if all the numbers are in the same set, and the other one is empty.
