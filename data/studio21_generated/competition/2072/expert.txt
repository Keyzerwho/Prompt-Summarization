 You are given a collection of $n$ integers. You want to hang the integers on a fridge door. The fridge door must be a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The fridge door must have length $L$ and width $W$. The integers must be arranged in such a way that the area of the fridge door is minimized. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ min(10, n - 1)) — the number of magnets that Edo has and the maximum number of magnets Edo may not place on the refrigerator. Next n lines describe the initial plan of placing magnets. Each line contains four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ x_1 < x_2 ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ y_1 < y_2 ≤ 10^9) — the coordinates of the lower left and upper right corners of the current magnet. The magnets can partially overlap or even fully coincide. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum area of the door of refrigerator, which can be used to place at least n - k magnets, preserving the relative positions.  -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 Output 1 Input 4 1 1 1 2 2 1 9 2 10 9 9 10 10 9 1 10 2 Output 64 Input 3 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 1000000000 1000000000 1 3 8 12 Output 249999999000000001 -----Note----- In the first test sample it is optimal to remove either the first or the third magnet. If we remove the first magnet, the centers of two others will lie at points (2.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 3.5). Thus, it is enough to buy a fridge with door width 1 and door height 1, the area of the door also equals one, correspondingly. In the second test sample it doesn't matter which magnet to remove, the answer will not change — we need a fridge with door width 8 and door height 8. In the third sample you cannot remove anything as k = 0.
