 You are given two non-negative integers (not necessary integers), and you need to find whether it is possible to have a sequence of weights (not necessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than Bob's. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the number of fish caught by Alice and Bob respectively, and the number of fish species. The second line contains n integers each from 1 to k, the list of fish type caught by Alice. The third line contains m integers each from 1 to k, the list of fish type caught by Bob. Note that one may have caught more than one fish for a same species. -----Output----- Output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 3 Output YES Input 4 7 9 5 2 7 3 3 5 2 7 3 8 7 Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample, if w_1 = 1, w_2 = 2, w_3 = 2.5,  then Alice has a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 weight units, while Bob only has 1 + 1 + 2.5 = 4.5. In the second sample, the fish that Alice caught is a subset of Bob's. Therefore, the total weight of Bob’s fish is always not less than the total weight of Alice’s fish.
