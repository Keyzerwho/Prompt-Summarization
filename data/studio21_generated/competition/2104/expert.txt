 You have two lists of points. The first list contains coordinates of all points that belong to some rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The second list contains $n$ of your favourite stars which appeared in the photo. Your task is to determine the dimensions of the photo.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an only integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100\,000$), the number of points in Pavel's records. The second line contains $2 \cdot n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_{2 \cdot n}$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$), coordinates, written by Pavel in some order. -----Output----- Print the only integer, the minimal area of the rectangle which could have contained all points from Pavel's records. -----Examples----- Input 4 4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 Output 1 Input 3 5 8 5 5 7 5 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample stars in Pavel's records can be $(1, 3)$, $(1, 3)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 4)$. In this case, the minimal area of the rectangle, which contains all these points is $1$ (rectangle with corners at $(1, 3)$ and $(2, 4)$).
