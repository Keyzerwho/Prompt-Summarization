 You are given two numbers. Find which number is greater than the other.
-----Input----- First line of input contains t (1≤ t ≤ 100) - the number of test cases. Each test case contains 2 lines each. The first line contains 2 space separated integers , X and Y (same as those specified in the problem statement; X ≤ 109 and Y ≤ 109 ). The next line contains 8 space separated integers (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h; 0 ≤ a ≤ c < Y; 0 ≤ e ≤ g < Y; a ≤ e; 0 ≤ b,d,f,h < X*Y ): specifying the times between which The Chef might have left (a:b => a hours and b minutes TO c:d => c hours and d minutes) and the times between which The Chef may have returned (The Chef returns sometime between e:f and g:h). The interval at which The Chef re-enters the kitchen will never start prior to the interval at which he first leaves the kitchen to purchase the ingredients. -----Output----- The output should contain one line for each test case specifying the time when The Chef left the kitchen. This should be in the form (h:m => h hours and m minutes). h will be an integer, and m should be rounded to 2 decimal places. In case, there is no solution possible, output -1 for that test case. -----Example----- Input: 3 5 12 1 0 2 0 4 0 5 0 5 12 3 30 4 0 5 0 6 0 5 12 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 Output: 1:20.56 -1 3:26.43 Note: Be careful with precision.
