 Given string s, consisting of lowercase English letters, and the integer m. Find the smallest string, s_{i}_{p}_1s_{i}_{p}_2... s_{i}_{p}_{t}, such that 1   i   |s| - m + 1. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000). The second line contains the string s consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that this string is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 100 000. It is also guaranteed that the number m doesn't exceed the length of the string s. -----Output----- Print the single line containing the lexicographically smallest string, that can be obtained using the procedure described above. -----Examples----- Input 3 cbabc Output a Input 2 abcab Output aab Input 3 bcabcbaccba Output aaabb -----Note----- In the first sample, one can choose the subsequence {3} and form a string "a". In the second sample, one can choose the subsequence {1, 2, 4} (symbols on this positions are 'a', 'b' and 'a') and rearrange the chosen symbols to form a string "aab".
