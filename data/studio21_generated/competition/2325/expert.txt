 You are given two strings S and T. For each query, determine whether S_{a_i} S_{{a_i}+1} ... S_{b_i}, a substring of S, can be made into T_{c_i} T_{{c_i}+1} ... T_{d_i}, a substring of T.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: S T q a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 ... a_q b_q c_q d_q -----Output----- Print q lines. The i-th line should contain the response to the i-th query. If S_{a_i} S_{{a_i}+1} ... S_{b_i} can be made into T_{c_i} T_{{c_i}+1} ... T_{d_i}, print YES. Otherwise, print NO. -----Sample Input----- BBBAAAABA BBBBA 4 7 9 2 5 7 9 1 4 1 7 2 5 1 7 2 4 -----Sample Output----- YES NO YES NO The first query asks whether the string ABA can be made into BBBA. As explained in the problem statement, it can be done by the first operation. The second query asks whether ABA can be made into BBBB, and the fourth query asks whether BBBAAAA can be made into BBB. Neither is possible. The third query asks whether the string BBBAAAA can be made into BBBA. As explained in the problem statement, it can be done by the second operation.
