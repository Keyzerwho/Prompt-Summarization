 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; 1 ≤ m ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of knights and the number of fights. Each of the following m lines contains three integers l_{i}, r_{i}, x_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} < r_{i} ≤ n; l_{i} ≤ x_{i} ≤ r_{i}) — the description of the i-th fight. It is guaranteed that the input is correct and matches the problem statement. It is guaranteed that at least two knights took part in each battle. -----Output----- Print n integers. If the i-th knight lost, then the i-th number should equal the number of the knight that beat the knight number i. If the i-th knight is the winner, then the i-th number must equal 0. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 4 4 Output 3 1 4 0  Input 8 4 3 5 4 3 7 6 2 8 8 1 8 1 Output 0 8 4 6 4 8 6 1  -----Note----- Consider the first test case. Knights 1 and 2 fought the first fight and knight 1 won. Knights 1 and 3 fought the second fight and knight 3 won. The last fight was between knights 3 and 4, knight 4 won.
