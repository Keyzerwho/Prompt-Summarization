 You are given a string $s$ and $q$ queries, represented by two integers $1 \le l \le r \le |s|$ (where $|s|$ is equal to the length of the string $s$). For each query, you should find if the substring of $s$ formed by characters from the $l$-th to the $r$-th has at least one irreducible anagram. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a string $s$, consisting of lowercase English characters ($1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). The second line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$)  — the number of queries. Each of the following $q$ lines contain two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le |s|$), representing a query for the substring of $s$ formed by characters from the $l$-th to the $r$-th. -----Output----- For each query, print a single line containing "Yes" (without quotes) if the corresponding substring has at least one irreducible anagram, and a single line containing "No" (without quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input aaaaa 3 1 1 2 4 5 5 Output Yes No Yes Input aabbbbbbc 6 1 2 2 4 2 2 1 9 5 7 3 5 Output No Yes Yes Yes No No -----Note----- In the first sample, in the first and third queries, the substring is "a", which has itself as an irreducible anagram since two or more non-empty strings cannot be put together to obtain "a". On the other hand, in the second query, the substring is "aaa", which has no irreducible anagrams: its only anagram is itself, and we may choose $s_1 = $ "a", $s_2 = $ "aa", $t_1 = $ "a", $t_2 = $ "aa" to show that it is a reducible anagram. In the second query of the second sample, the substring is "abb", which has, for example, "bba" as an irreducible anagram.
