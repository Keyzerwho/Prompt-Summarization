 You are given a graph G with n vertices and m edges. Takahashi has an ability to generate a tree using a permutation (p_1,p_2,...,p_n) of (1,2,...,n), in the following process: First, prepare Vertex 1, Vertex 2, ..., Vertex N. For each i=1,2,...,n, perform the following operation:  - If p_i = 1, do nothing.  - If p_i \neq 1,
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: n v_1 w_1 v_2 w_2 : v_{n-1} w_{n-1} -----Output----- If there is no permutation that can generate a tree isomorphic to Takahashi's favorite tree, print -1. If it exists, print the lexicographically smallest such permutation, with spaces in between. -----Sample Input----- 6 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 5 6 -----Sample Output----- 1 2 4 5 3 6 If the permutation (1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6) is used to generate a tree, it looks as follows: This is isomorphic to the given graph.
