 Input is an array of integers. Output is an array of integers. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M p_1 p_2 .. p_N x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 : x_M y_M -----Output----- Print the maximum possible number of i such that p_i = i after operations. -----Sample Input----- 5 2 5 3 1 4 2 1 3 5 4 -----Sample Output----- 2 If we perform the operation by choosing j=1, p becomes 1 3 5 4 2, which is optimal, so the answer is 2.
