 You are given $2^n$ teams $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$. You want the championship to have as many games with your favourite teams as possible. Luckily, you can affect results of every championship game the way you want. What's maximal possible number of championship games that include teams you're fan of  
-----Input----- First input line has two integers $n, k$ — $2^n$ teams are competing in the championship. You are a fan of $k$ teams ($2 \le n \le 17; 0 \le k \le 2^n$). Second input line has $k$ distinct integers $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ — numbers of teams you're a fan of ($1 \le a_i \le 2^n$). -----Output----- Output single integer — maximal possible number of championship games that include teams you're fan of. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 6 Output 6 Input 3 3 1 7 8 Output 11 Input 3 4 1 3 5 7 Output 14 -----Note----- On the image, each game of the championship is denoted with an English letter ($a$ to $n$). Winner of game $i$ is denoted as $Wi$, loser is denoted as $Li$. Teams you're a fan of are highlighted with red background. In the first example, team $6$ will play in 6 games if it looses the first upper bracket game (game $c$) and wins all lower bracket games (games $h, j, l, m$). [Image] In the second example, teams $7$ and $8$ have to play with each other in the first game of upper bracket (game $d$). Team $8$ can win all remaining games in upper bracket, when teams $1$ and $7$ will compete in the lower bracket. [Image] In the third example, your favourite teams can play in all games of the championship. [Image]
