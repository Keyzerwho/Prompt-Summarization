 Serge comes to the school dining room and discovers that there is a big queue here. There are $m$ pupils in the queue. He's not sure now if he wants to wait until the queue will clear, so he wants to know which dish he will receive if he does. As Serge is very tired, he asks you to compute it instead of him. Initially there are $n$ dishes with costs $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. As you already know, there are the queue of $m$ pupils who have $b_1, \ldots, b_m$ togrogs respectively (pupils are enumerated by queue
-----Input----- The first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 300\ 000$) — number of dishes and pupils respectively. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{6}$) — elements of array $a$. The third line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{m}$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 10^{6}$) — elements of array $b$. The fourth line conatins integer $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq 300\ 000$) — number of queries. Each of the following $q$ lines contains as follows:   if a query changes price of some dish, it contains $1$, and two integers $i$ and $x$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq x \leq 10^{6}$), what means $a_i$ becomes $x$.  if a query changes number of togrogs of some pupil, it contains $2$, and two integers $i$ and $x$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$, $1 \leq x \leq 10^{6}$), what means $b_i$ becomes $x$.  -----Output----- For each of $q$ queries prints the answer as the statement describes, the answer of the $i$-th query in the $i$-th line (the price of the dish which Serge will buy or $-1$ if nothing remains) -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 100 Output 100 Input 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 100 Output -1 Input 4 6 1 8 2 4 3 3 6 1 5 2 3 1 1 1 2 5 10 1 1 6 Output 8 -1 4 -----Note----- In the first sample after the first query, there is one dish with price $100$ togrogs and one pupil with one togrog, so Serge will buy the dish with price $100$ togrogs. In the second sample after the first query, there is one dish with price one togrog and one pupil with $100$ togrogs, so Serge will get nothing. In the third sample after the first query, nobody can buy the dish with price $8$, so Serge will take it. After the second query, all dishes will be bought, after the third one the third and fifth pupils will by the first and the second dishes respectively and nobody will by the fourth one.
