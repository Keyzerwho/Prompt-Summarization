 You are given a sandglass consisting of two bulbs, bulb A and bulb B. These bulbs contain some amount of sand. When we put the sandglass, either bulb A or B lies on top of the other and becomes the upper bulb. The other bulb becomes the lower bulb. The sand drops from the upper bulb to the lower bulb at a rate of 1 gram per second. When the upper bulb no longer contains any sand, nothing happens. Initially at time 0, bulb A is the upper bulb and contains a grams of sand; bulb B contains X-a grams of sand (for a total of X grams). We will turn over
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: X K r_1 r_2 .. r_K Q t_1 a_1 t_2 a_2 : t_Q a_Q -----Output----- For each query, print the answer in its own line. -----Sample Input----- 180 3 60 120 180 3 30 90 61 1 180 180 -----Sample Output----- 60 1 120 In the first query, 30 out of the initial 90 grams of sand will drop from bulb A, resulting in 60 grams. In the second query, the initial 1 gram of sand will drop from bulb A, and nothing will happen for the next 59 seconds. Then, we will turn over the sandglass, and 1 second after this, bulb A contains 1 gram of sand at the time in question.
