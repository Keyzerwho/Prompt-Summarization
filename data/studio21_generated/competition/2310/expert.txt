 You are given N tiles. Each tile can be occupied by at most one rock. You need to place N rocks on the tiles in such a way that no rock hits a wall. 
-----Input----- The first line will consists of two integers n and x, denoting the size of the room and the number of sounds required to open the door. There will be exactly three test cases for this problem:   n = 5, x = 5;  n = 3, x = 2;  n = 100, x = 10^5.  All of these testcases are in pretest. -----Output----- Output n lines. Each line consists of n characters — the j-th character of the i-th line represents the content of the tile at the i-th row and the j-th column, and should be one of these:   '^', '<', '>', or 'v': a rock as described in the problem statement.  '.': an empty tile.  Then, output two integers r and c (1 ≤ r, c ≤ n) on the next line — this means that the rock you activate first is located at the r-th row from above and c-th column from the left. There must be a rock in this cell. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 Output >...v v.<.. ..^.. >.... ..^.< 1 1 Input 3 2 Output >vv ^<. ^.< 1 3 -----Note----- Here's a simulation of the first example, accompanied with the number of sounds produced so far.  $8$ 0 sound   [Image] 1 sound   $8$ 2 sounds   $8$ 3 sounds   $8$ 4 sounds   $8$ still 4 sounds  In the picture above, the activated rock switches between the '^' rock and the '<' rock. However, no sound is produced since the '^' rock didn't move even a single tile. So, still 4 sound.  [Image] 5 sounds  At this point, 5 sound are already produced, so this solution is already correct. However, for the sake of example, we will continue simulating what happens.  [Image] 6 sounds   [Image] 7 sounds   [Image] still 7 sounds   [Image] 8 sounds  And the movement stops. In total, it produces 8 sounds. Notice that the last move produced sound. Here's a simulation of the second example:  [Image] 0 sound   [Image] 1 sound   [Image] 2 sounds  Now, the activated stone will switch continuously from one to another without producing a sound until it reaches the 10^7 limit, after which the movement will cease.  [Image]  In total, it produced exactly 2 sounds, so the solution is correct.
