 You are given array $a$ of length $n$.  Find the maximum score of Koa and her best friend. 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of $a$. The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — elements of $a$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case print:  WIN if Koa will win the game.  LOSE if Koa will lose the game.  DRAW if the game ends in a draw.  -----Examples----- Input 3 3 1 2 2 3 2 2 3 5 0 0 0 2 2 Output WIN LOSE DRAW Input 4 5 4 1 5 1 3 4 1 0 1 6 1 0 2 5 4 Output WIN WIN DRAW WIN -----Note----- In testcase $1$ of the first sample we have: $a = [1, 2, 2]$. Here Koa chooses $1$, other player has to choose $2$, Koa chooses another $2$. Score for Koa is $1 \oplus 2 = 3$ and score for other player is $2$ so Koa wins.
