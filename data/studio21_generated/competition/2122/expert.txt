 You are given n requests. The i-th request is characterized by two values: s_{i}   the day when a client wants to start the repair of his car, d_{i}   duration (in days) to repair the car. The days are enumerated from 1, the first day is tomorrow, the second day is the day after tomorrow and so on. Polycarp is making schedule by processing requests in the order from the first to the n-th request. He schedules the i-th request as follows:  If the car repair shop is idle for d_{i} days starting from s_{i
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the number of requests from clients. The following n lines contain requests, one request per line. The i-th request is given as the pair of integers s_{i}, d_{i} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 5·10^6), where s_{i} is the preferred time to start repairing the i-th car, d_{i} is the number of days to repair the i-th car. The requests should be processed in the order they are given in the input. -----Output----- Print n lines. The i-th line should contain two integers — the start day to repair the i-th car and the finish day to repair the i-th car. -----Examples----- Input 3 9 2 7 3 2 4 Output 9 10 1 3 4 7 Input 4 1000000000 1000000 1000000000 1000000 100000000 1000000 1000000000 1000000 Output 1000000000 1000999999 1 1000000 100000000 100999999 1000001 2000000
