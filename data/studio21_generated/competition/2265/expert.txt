 You are given a list of 3 integers (1,2,3) (a,b,c). You are also given a list of 2 integers (1,2) (a,b). Determine if the 2 integers (a,b) can be rearranged so that a>b>c>a. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N p_1 : p_N -----Output----- If the state where p_i=i for every i can be reached by performing the operation, print Yes; otherwise, print No. -----Sample Input----- 5 5 2 1 4 3 -----Sample Output----- Yes The state where p_i=i for every i can be reached as follows:  - Reverse the order of p_1,p_2,p_3. The sequence p becomes 1,2,5,4,3.  - Reverse the order of p_3,p_4,p_5. The sequence p becomes 1,2,3,4,5.
