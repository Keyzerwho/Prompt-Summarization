 You are given an array of integers. Find the minimum number in array which satisfies all conditions. Example 1: Input: array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n,m$ ($1 \leq m \leq n \leq 100\,000$). The second line contains $m$ integers $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$ ($1 \leq l_i \leq n$). -----Output----- If it's impossible to perform $m$ operations to satisfy all constraints, print "'-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, print $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq n - l_i + 1$), after these $m$ operations, all colors should appear at least once and all cells should be colored. If there are several possible solutions, you can print any. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 3 2 2 Output 2 4 1 Input 10 1 1 Output -1
