 You are given an undirected graph. There is one vertex with 0 yen and two vertices with 10^9 yen. You need to transfer money between vertices so that after t transfers, you have at least 0 yen. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M A_1 B_1 A_2 B_2 : A_N B_N U_1 V_1 U_2 V_2 : U_M V_M -----Output----- Print the smallest initial amount of money W that enables you to win the game. -----Sample Input----- 4 5 3 1 1 2 4 1 6 2 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 4 3 4 -----Sample Output----- 6 If you have 6 yen initially, you can win the game as follows:  - Stand on Vertex 4. This is possible since you have not less than 6 yen.  - Donate 2 yen to Vertex 4. Now you have 4 yen.  - Move to Vertex 3. This is possible since you have not less than 4 yen.  - Donate 1 yen to Vertex 3. Now you have 3 yen.  - Move to Vertex 2. This is possible since you have not less than 1 yen.  - Move to Vertex 1. This is possible since you have not less than 3 yen.  - Donate 1 yen to Vertex 1. Now you have 2 yen.  - Move to Vertex 2. This is possible since you have not less than 1 yen.  - Donate 2 yen to Vertex 2. Now you have 0 yen. If you have less than 6 yen initially, you cannot win the game. Thus, the answer is 6.
