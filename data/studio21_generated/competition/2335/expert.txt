 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 10^5)$  — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 10^5)$  — the size of the permutation. The second line of the test case contains $n$ different integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq n$)  — the permutation written by Denis. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- Print "Yes" if this permutation could be obtained as a result of the generator. Otherwise, print "No". All letters can be displayed in any case. -----Example----- Input 5 5 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 3 1 3 2 4 4 2 3 1 5 1 5 2 4 3 Output Yes Yes No Yes No -----Note----- Let's simulate the operation of the generator in the first test. At the $1$ step, $r = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$. The maximum value is reached in any free position, so the generator can choose a random position from $1$ to $5$. In our example, it chose $5$. At the $2$ step, $r = [1, 2, 3, 4, \times], count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]$. The maximum value is reached in positions from $1$ to $4$, so the generator can choose a random position among them. In our example, it chose $1$. At the $3$ step, $r = [2, 2, 3, 4, \times], count = [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]$. The maximum value is $2$ and is reached only at the $2$ position, so the generator will choose this position. At the $4$ step, $r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \times], count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$. The maximum value is $3$ and is reached only at the $3$ position, so the generator will choose this position. At the $5$ step, $r = [4, 4, 4, 4, \times], count = [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]$. The maximum value is $4$ and is reached only at the $4$ position, so the generator will choose this position. In total, we got a permutation of $2, 3, 4, 5, 1$, that is, a generator could generate it.
