 Let N be a positive even number. We have a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N), p = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_N). Snuke is constructing another permutation of (1, 2, ..., N), q, following the procedure below. First, let q be an empty sequence. Then, perform the following operation until p becomes empty:  - Select two adjacent elements in p, and call them x and y in order. Remove x and y from p (
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N p_1 p_2 ... p_N -----Output----- Print the lexicographically smallest permutation, with spaces in between. -----Sample Input----- 4 3 2 4 1 -----Sample Output----- 3 1 2 4 The solution above is obtained as follows:pq(3, 2, 4, 1)()↓↓(3, 1)(2, 4)↓↓()(3, 1, 2, 4)
