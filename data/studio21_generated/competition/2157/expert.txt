 You are given a set Y of n distinct positive integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{n}. Set X of n distinct positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} is said to generate set Y if one can transform X to Y by applying some number of the following two operation to integers in X:  Take any integer x_{i} and multiply it by two, i.e. replace x_{i} with 2 x_{i}.  Take any integer x_{
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50 000) — the number of elements in Y. The second line contains n integers y_1, ..., y_{n} (1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ 10^9), that are guaranteed to be distinct. -----Output----- Print n integers — set of distinct integers that generate Y and the maximum element of which is minimum possible. If there are several such sets, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 4 5 2 3 1  Input 6 15 14 3 13 1 12 Output 12 13 14 7 3 1  Input 6 9 7 13 17 5 11 Output 4 5 2 6 3 1
