 you are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- In the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence. In the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of them will be accepted. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 3 3 4 Output 1 2 3 4 4  Input 5 3 2 2 5 3 Output 0 3 2 2 5 3  Input 8 2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7 Output 2 2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7 -----Note----- In the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p_4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red. [Image]  In the second sample, the given sequence is already valid.
