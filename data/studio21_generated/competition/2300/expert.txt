 You are given a rooted tree with N+1 vertices. The vertices are numbered 0 through N, and Vertex 0 is the root of the tree. The parent of Vertex i (1 \leq i \leq N) is Vertex p_i. Besides this tree, Snuke also has an box which is initially empty and many marbles, and playing with them. The play begins with placing one marble on some of the vertices, then proceeds as follows:  - If there is a marble on Vertex 0, move the marble into the box.  - Move each marble from the vertex to its parent 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N p_1 p_2 ... p_{N} -----Output----- Print the answer. -----Sample Input----- 2 0 0 -----Sample Output----- 8 When we place a marble on both Vertex 1 and 2, there will be multiple marbles on Vertex 0 by step 2. In such a case, these marbles will be removed instead of being moved to the box.
