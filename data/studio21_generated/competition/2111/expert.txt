 You are given a list of integers where each integer is current level of a skill. You are given m hacknetian currency units. Each currency unit can increase the current level of any skill by 1 (if it's not equal to A yet). Help him spend his money in order to achieve the maximum possible value of the Force. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers n, A, c_{f}, c_{m} and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ A ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ c_{f}, c_{m} ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^15). The second line contains exactly n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ A), separated by spaces, — the current levels of skills. -----Output----- On the first line print the maximum value of the Force that the character can achieve using no more than m currency units. On the second line print n integers a'_{i} (a_{i} ≤ a'_{i} ≤ A), skill levels which one must achieve in order to reach the specified value of the Force, while using no more than m currency units. Numbers should be separated by spaces. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 10 1 5 1 3 1 Output 12 2 5 2  Input 3 5 10 1 339 1 3 1 Output 35 5 5 5  -----Note----- In the first test the optimal strategy is to increase the second skill to its maximum, and increase the two others by 1. In the second test one should increase all skills to maximum.
