 Given two random permutations, find whether one of them is equal to the other one. 
-----Input----- In the first line of input there is one integer $n$ ($10^{3} \le n \le 10^{6}$). In the second line there are $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$ — the permutation of size $n$ from the test. It is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose $n$ — the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation — the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method. -----Output----- If the test is generated via Petr's method print "Petr" (without quotes). If the test is generated via Alex's method print "Um_nik" (without quotes). -----Example----- Input 5 2 4 5 1 3 Output Petr -----Note----- Please note that the sample is not a valid test (because of limitations for $n$) and is given only to illustrate input/output format. Your program still has to print correct answer to this test to get AC. Due to randomness of input hacks in this problem are forbidden.
