 The input given is an array of integers. You need to write a method ```add_requests``` that accepts an array of integers and an integer n, and returns an array of integers. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the duration of the load testing. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), where a_{i} is the number of requests from friends in the i-th minute of the load testing. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of additional requests from Polycarp that would make the load strictly increasing in the beginning and then strictly decreasing afterwards. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 4 3 2 5 Output 6 Input 5 1 2 2 2 1 Output 1 Input 7 10 20 40 50 70 90 30 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example Polycarp must make two additional requests in the third minute and four additional requests in the fourth minute. So the resulting load will look like: [1, 4, 5, 6, 5]. In total, Polycarp will make 6 additional requests. In the second example it is enough to make one additional request in the third minute, so the answer is 1. In the third example the load already satisfies all conditions described in the statement, so the answer is 0.
