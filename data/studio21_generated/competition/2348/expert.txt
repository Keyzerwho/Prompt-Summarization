 You are given N hotels located in a straight line. Tak the traveler has the following two personal principles:  - He never travels a distance of more than L in a single day.  - He never sleeps in the open. That is, he must stay at a hotel at the end of a day. You are given Q queries. The j-th (1 \leq j \leq Q) query is described by two distinct integers a_j and b_j. For each query, find the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from the a_j-th hotel to the b_j-th hotel following his principles. It is guaranteed that he can always travel from the a_j-th hotel to the b_j-th
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N x_1 x_2 ... x_N L Q a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 : a_Q b_Q -----Output----- Print Q lines. The j-th line (1 \leq j \leq Q) should contain the minimum number of days that Tak needs to travel from the a_j-th hotel to the b_j-th hotel. -----Sample Input----- 9 1 3 6 13 15 18 19 29 31 10 4 1 8 7 3 6 7 8 5 -----Sample Output----- 4 2 1 2 For the 1-st query, he can travel from the 1-st hotel to the 8-th hotel in 4 days, as follows:  - Day 1: Travel from the 1-st hotel to the 2-nd hotel. The distance traveled is 2.  - Day 2: Travel from the 2-nd hotel to the 4-th hotel. The distance traveled is 10.  - Day 3: Travel from the 4-th hotel to the 7-th hotel. The distance traveled is 6.  - Day 4: Travel from the 7-th hotel to the 8-th hotel. The distance traveled is 10.
