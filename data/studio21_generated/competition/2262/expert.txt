 You are given a board with dimensions R   C, filled with numbers. Each integer i from 1 through N is written twice, at the coordinates (x_{i,1},y_{i,1}) and (x_{i,2},y_{i,2}). The objective is to draw a curve connecting the pair of points where the same integer is written, for every integer from 1 through N. Here, the curves may not go outside the board or cross each other. Determine whether this is possible.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: R C N x_{1,1} y_{1,1} x_{1,2} y_{1,2} : x_{N,1} y_{N,1} x_{N,2} y_{N,2} -----Output----- Print YES if the objective is achievable; print NO otherwise. -----Sample Input----- 4 2 3 0 1 3 1 1 1 4 1 2 0 2 2 -----Sample Output----- YES The above figure shows a possible solution.
