 Given some formula $f$, your task is to assign quantifiers $Q_1,\ldots,Q_n$ to either universal ($\forall$) or existential ($\exists$) so that the statement $$ Q_1 x_1, Q_2 x_2, \ldots, Q_n x_n, f(x_1,\ldots, x_n) $$ is true, and the number of universal quantifiers is maximized, or determine that the statement is false for every possible assignment of quantifiers. Note that the order the variables
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$; $1\le m\le 2\cdot 10^5$) — the number of variables and the number of inequalities in the formula, respectively. The next $m$ lines describe the formula. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $j_i$,$k_i$ ($1\le j_i,k_i\le n$, $j_i\ne k_i$). -----Output----- If there is no assignment of quantifiers for which the statement is true, output a single integer $-1$. Otherwise, on the first line output an integer, the maximum possible number of universal quantifiers. On the next line, output a string of length $n$, where the $i$-th character is "A" if $Q_i$ should be a universal quantifier ($\forall$), or "E" if $Q_i$ should be an existential quantifier ($\exists$). All letters should be upper-case. If there are multiple solutions where the number of universal quantifiers is maximum, print any. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 1 2 Output 1 AE Input 4 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 Output -1 Input 3 2 1 3 2 3 Output 2 AAE -----Note----- For the first test, the statement $\forall x_1, \exists x_2, x_1<x_2$ is true. Answers of "EA" and "AA" give false statements. The answer "EE" gives a true statement, but the number of universal quantifiers in this string is less than in our answer. For the second test, we can show that no assignment of quantifiers, for which the statement is true exists. For the third test, the statement $\forall x_1, \forall x_2, \exists x_3, (x_1<x_3)\land (x_2<x_3)$ is true: We can set $x_3=\max\{x_1,x_2\}+1$.
