 
-----Input----- The first line contains integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration. The next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i} ≤ n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} — the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka). It is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order. -----Output----- In the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 1 2 1 3 Output 1 Input 7 3 3 1 3 7 2 2 5 2 4 6 Output 10 -----Note----- In the first sample test there are two chains: 1 → 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 → 2 → 3. In the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.
