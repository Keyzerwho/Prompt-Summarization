 Given $n$ numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}$. Jeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible (that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible). Help Jeff find the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game if he moves optimally well. You can consider that the coin shows the heads (or tails) with the probability of 50 percent. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000). The next line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation p. The numbers are separated by spaces. -----Output----- In a single line print a single real value — the answer to the problem. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 Output 0.000000 Input 5 3 5 2 4 1 Output 13.000000 -----Note----- In the first test the sequence is already sorted, so the answer is 0.
