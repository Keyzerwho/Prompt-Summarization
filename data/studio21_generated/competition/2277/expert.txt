 You are given two arrays, Lynyrd's permutation and Skynyrd's array. Lynyrd's permutation is a permutation of length $n$, and Skynyrd's array is an array of length $m$, consisting of integers from $1$ to $n$.  Lynyrd and Skynyrd became bored, so they asked you $q$ queries, each of which has the following form: "does the subsegment of $a$ from the $l$-th to the $r$-th positions, inclusive, have a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $q$ ($1 \le n, m, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the permutation $p$, the length of the array $a$ and the number of queries. The next line contains $n$ integers from $1$ to $n$, where the $i$-th of them is the $i$-th element of the permutation. Each integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once. The next line contains $m$ integers from $1$ to $n$, the $i$-th of them is the $i$-th element of the array $a$. The next $q$ lines describe queries. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le m$), meaning that the $i$-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the $l_i$-th to the $r_i$-th positions, inclusive. -----Output----- Print a single string of length $q$, consisting of $0$ and $1$, the digit on the $i$-th positions should be $1$, if the subsegment of array $a$ from the $l_i$-th to the $r_i$-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of $p$, and $0$ otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 6 3 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 5 2 6 3 5 Output 110 Input 2 4 3 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 Output 010 -----Note----- In the first example the segment from the $1$-st to the $5$-th positions is $1, 2, 3, 1, 2$. There is a subsequence $1, 3, 2$ that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the $2$-nd to the $6$-th positions also contains a subsequence $2, 1, 3$ that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the $3$-rd to the $5$-th positions is $3, 1, 2$, there is only one subsequence of length $3$ ($3, 1, 2$), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation. In the second example the possible cyclic shifts are $1, 2$ and $2, 1$. The subsegment from the $1$-st to the $2$-nd positions is $1, 1$, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation. The subsegment from the $2$-nd to the $3$-rd positions is $1, 2$, it coincides with the permutation. The subsegment from the $3$ to the $4$ positions is $2, 2$, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation.
