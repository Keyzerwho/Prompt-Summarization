 You are given an isosceles triangle with base length = 1 and height = h, and n - 1 cuts parallel to the base. Return the area of each piece.   Example 1: Input: h = 2, n = 3 Output: 4.5 Explanation: 
  1.  Base is 1, thus 1/2 of the base is 1.   
  2.  Height is 2, thus 1/2 of the
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers, n and h (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- The output should contain n - 1 real numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} - 1. The number x_{i} denotes that the i-th cut must be made x_{i} units away from the apex of the carrot. In addition, 0 < x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{n} - 1 < h must hold.  Your output will be considered correct if absolute or relative error of every number in your output doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 Output 1.154700538379 1.632993161855 Input 2 100000 Output 70710.678118654752 -----Note----- Definition of isosceles triangle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosceles_triangle.
