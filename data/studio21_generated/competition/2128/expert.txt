 You are given an array. You need to compute the minimum lost milk.   Example 1: Input: cows = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38] Output: 2
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} is 0 if the cow number i is facing left, and 1 if it is facing right. -----Output----- Print a single integer, the minimum amount of lost milk. Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 4 0 0 1 0 Output 1 Input 5 1 0 1 0 1 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample Iahub milks the cows in the following order: cow 3, cow 4, cow 2, cow 1. When he milks cow 3, cow 4 loses 1 unit of milk. After that, no more milk is lost.
