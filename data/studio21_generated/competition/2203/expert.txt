 The input will be formed so that it is guaranteed that there is at least one solution that is consistent with the information given.
-----Input----- The first line of the input will contain a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50). The next n lines will contain the values of a_{i}, j. The j-th number on the i-th line will represent a_{i}, j. The i-th number on the i-th line will be 0. It's guaranteed that a_{i}, j = a_{j}, i and there is at least one solution consistent with the information given. -----Output----- Print n space separated integers, which represents a permutation that could have generated these values. If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 0 1 1 0 Output 2 1 Input 5 0 2 2 1 2 2 0 4 1 3 2 4 0 1 3 1 1 1 0 1 2 3 3 1 0 Output 2 5 4 1 3 -----Note----- In the first case, the answer can be {1, 2} or {2, 1}. In the second case, another possible answer is {2, 4, 5, 1, 3}.
