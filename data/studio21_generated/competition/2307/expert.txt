 You are given a list of n integers. Each integer is a distance traveled by walking or teleporting. Find the minimum possible total increase of your fatigue level when you visit all the towns in these two ways. 
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A B X_1 X_2 ... X_N -----Output----- Print the minimum possible total increase of your fatigue level when you visit all the towns. -----Sample Input----- 4 2 5 1 2 5 7 -----Sample Output----- 11 From town 1, walk a distance of 1 to town 2, then teleport to town 3, then walk a distance of 2 to town 4. The total increase of your fatigue level in this case is 2×1+5+2×2=11, which is the minimum possible value.
