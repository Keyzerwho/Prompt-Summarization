 Given two integers n and m, find the number of tests in which the algorithm works correctly.
-----Input----- The first line contains non-empty string s, its length (n) doesn't exceed 10^5. It is guaranteed that string s only contains characters: 'x', 'y', 'z'. The second line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of tests. Next m lines contain the tests. The i-th line contains a pair of integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- For each test, print "YES" (without the quotes) if the algorithm works correctly on the corresponding test and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input zyxxxxxxyyz 5 5 5 1 3 1 11 1 4 3 6 Output YES YES NO YES NO -----Note----- In the first example, in test one and two the algorithm will always be terminated in one step. In the fourth test you can get string "xzyx" on which the algorithm will terminate. In all other tests the algorithm doesn't work correctly.
