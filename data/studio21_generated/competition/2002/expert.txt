 You are given a string s and an integer k. Vasya and Kolya play a game with a string, using the following rules. Initially, Kolya creates a string s, consisting of small English letters, and uniformly at random chooses an integer k from a segment [0, len(s) - 1]. He tells Vasya this string s, and then shifts it k letters to the left, i. e. creates a new string t = s_{k} + 1s_{k} + 2... s_{n}s_1s_2
-----Input----- The only string contains the string s of length l (3 ≤ l ≤ 5000), consisting of small English letters only. -----Output----- Print the only number — the answer for the problem. You answer is considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-6}$ -----Examples----- Input technocup Output 1.000000000000000 Input tictictactac Output 0.333333333333333 Input bbaabaabbb Output 0.100000000000000 -----Note----- In the first example Vasya can always open the second letter after opening the first letter, and the cyclic shift is always determined uniquely. In the second example if the first opened letter of t is "t" or "c", then Vasya can't guess the shift by opening only one other letter. On the other hand, if the first letter is "i" or "a", then he can open the fourth letter and determine the shift uniquely.
