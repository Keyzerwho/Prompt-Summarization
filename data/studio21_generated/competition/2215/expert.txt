 You are given a list of cities, roads and trains. You need to output a sorted list. The length of the shortest path from every city to the capital mustn't change.
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m, k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ m ≤ 3·10^5; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5). Each of the next m lines contains three integers u_{i}, v_{i}, x_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n; u_{i} ≠ v_{i}; 1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9). Each of the next k lines contains two integers s_{i} and y_{i} (2 ≤ s_{i} ≤ n; 1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ 10^9). It is guaranteed that there is at least one way from every city to the capital. Note, that there can be multiple roads between two cities. Also, there can be multiple routes going to the same city from the capital. -----Output----- Output a single integer representing the maximum number of the train routes which can be closed. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 3 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 3 3 3 4 4 1 5 5 3 5 4 5 5 5 Output 2 Input 2 2 3 1 2 2 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 3 Output 2
