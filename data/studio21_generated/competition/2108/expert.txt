 You need to help Sherlock get all the pairs of potential victims at each day so that Sherlock can observe some pattern.
-----Input----- First line of input contains two names (length of each of them doesn't exceed 10), the two initials potential victims. Next line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of days. Next n lines contains two names (length of each of them doesn't exceed 10), first being the person murdered on this day and the second being the one who replaced that person. The input format is consistent, that is, a person murdered is guaranteed to be from the two potential victims at that time. Also, all the names are guaranteed to be distinct and consists of lowercase English letters. -----Output----- Output n + 1 lines, the i-th line should contain the two persons from which the killer selects for the i-th murder. The (n + 1)-th line should contain the two persons from which the next victim is selected. In each line, the two names can be printed in any order. -----Examples----- Input ross rachel 4 ross joey rachel phoebe phoebe monica monica chandler Output ross rachel joey rachel joey phoebe joey monica joey chandler Input icm codeforces 1 codeforces technex Output icm codeforces icm technex -----Note----- In first example, the killer starts with ross and rachel.   After day 1, ross is killed and joey appears.  After day 2, rachel is killed and phoebe appears.  After day 3, phoebe is killed and monica appears.  After day 4, monica is killed and chandler appears.
