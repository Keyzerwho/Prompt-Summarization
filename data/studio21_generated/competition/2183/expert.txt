 You are given a string $s$ consisting only of digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$.  There is one cursor. The cursor's location $\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\{0, \ldots, |s|\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\ell = 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters "1", "2", "3". It is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $\ell \le |s|$ at any time. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $10^9 + 7$.  -----Example----- Input 4 5 231 7 2323 6 333 24 133321333 Output 25 1438 1101 686531475 -----Note----- Let's illustrate what happens with the first test case. Initially, we have $s = $ 231. Initially, $\ell = 0$ and $c = \varepsilon$ (the empty string). The following things happen if we follow the procedure above:   Step 1, Move once: we get $\ell = 1$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2 and $c = $ 31.  Step 3, Paste $s_\ell = $ 2 times: we get $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\ell = 1 \not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1.    Step 1, Move once: we get $\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\ell = 2 \not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1.    Step 1, Move once: we get $\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\ell = 3 \not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1.    Step 1, Move once: we get $\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\ell = 4 \not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1.    Step 1, Move once: we get $\ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\ell = $ 1 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\ell = 5 = x$, so we stop.  At the end of the procedure, $s$ has length $25$.
