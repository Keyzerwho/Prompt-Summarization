 You are given a tree. Find the shortest path. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the number of vertices n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). Next n - 1 lines describe edges of the tree. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) — indices of endpoints of the corresponding edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. -----Output----- If it is impossible to obtain a path, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum number of edges in a possible path. -----Examples----- Input 6 1 2 2 3 2 4 4 5 1 6 Output 3 Input 7 1 2 1 3 3 4 1 5 5 6 6 7 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample case, a path of three edges is obtained after merging paths 2 - 1 - 6 and 2 - 4 - 5. It is impossible to perform any operation in the second sample case. For example, it is impossible to merge paths 1 - 3 - 4 and 1 - 5 - 6, since vertex 6 additionally has a neighbour 7 that is not present in the corresponding path.
