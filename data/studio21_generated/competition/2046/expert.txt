 You are given sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. Suppose for each i (1   i   n - 1) we run the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. For each such run output the final value of y if the program terminates or -1 if it does not terminate. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer, n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). The next line contains n - 1 space separated integers, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Output n - 1 lines. On the i-th line, print the requested value when the program is run on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ...a_{n}. Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 4 1 Output 3 6 8 Input 3 1 2 Output -1 -1 -----Note----- In the first sample   For i = 1,  x becomes $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 0$ and y becomes 1 + 2 = 3.  For i = 2,  x becomes $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow - 1$ and y becomes 2 + 4 = 6.  For i = 3,  x becomes $1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 7$ and y becomes 3 + 1 + 4 = 8.
