 You are given the number n and maximum possible efficiency a. You need to find the maximum possible efficiency of the workgroup formed at observing the given condition. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of workers of the Big Software Company.  Then n lines follow, describing the company employees. The i-th line contains two integers p_{i}, a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5) — the number of the person who is the i-th employee's immediate superior and i-th employee's efficiency. For the director p_1 =  - 1, for all other people the condition 1 ≤ p_{i} < i is fulfilled. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum possible efficiency of the workgroup. -----Examples----- Input 7 -1 3 1 2 1 1 1 4 4 5 4 3 5 2 Output 17 -----Note----- In the sample test the most effective way is to make a workgroup from employees number 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.
