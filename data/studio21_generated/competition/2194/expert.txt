 You are given a tree with root node and n leaf nodes. For every leaf node, you have to find an expected value of starting_time[i]. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of cities in USC. The second line contains n - 1 integers p_2, p_3, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} < i), where p_{i} is the number of the parent city of city number i in the tree, meaning there is a road between cities numbered p_{i} and i in USC. -----Output----- In the first and only line of output print n numbers, where i-th number is the expected value of starting_time[i]. Your answer for each city will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 7 1 2 1 1 4 4 Output 1.0 4.0 5.0 3.5 4.5 5.0 5.0  Input 12 1 1 2 2 4 4 3 3 1 10 8 Output 1.0 5.0 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.5 6.5 7.5 8.0
