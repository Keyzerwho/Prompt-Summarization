 Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. Example: X..X ...X ...X In the above 2 dimentional array there are 2 structures. Invalid Example: ...X XXXX ...X This is an invalid 2 dimentional array that you will not receive.
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 363\,304$) â€” the number of actions in the log. Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string "ACCEPT" or "ADD" and an integer $p$ ($1 \le p \le 308\,983\,066$), describing an action type and price.  All ADD actions have different prices. For ACCEPT action it is guaranteed that the order with the same price has already been added but has not been accepted yet. -----Output----- Output the number of ways to restore directions of ADD actions modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Input 6 ADD 1 ACCEPT 1 ADD 2 ACCEPT 2 ADD 3 ACCEPT 3 Output 8 Input 4 ADD 1 ADD 2 ADD 3 ACCEPT 2 Output 2 Input 7 ADD 1 ADD 2 ADD 3 ADD 4 ADD 5 ACCEPT 3 ACCEPT 5 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example each of orders may be BUY or SELL. In the second example the order with price $1$ has to be BUY order, the order with the price $3$ has to be SELL order.
