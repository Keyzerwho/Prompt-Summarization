 You are given a multiset with integers. Friends give you t queries, each of one of the following type:  +  a_{i}   add non-negative integer a_{i} to the multiset. Note, that she has a multiset, thus there may be many occurrences of the same integer.  -  a_{i}   delete a single occurrence of non-negative integer a_{i} from the multiset. It's guaranteed, that there is at least one a_{i} in the multiset.  s   count the number of integers in the multiset (with repetitions) that match some
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 000) — the number of operation Sonya has to perform. Next t lines provide the descriptions of the queries in order they appear in the input file. The i-th row starts with a character c_{i} — the type of the corresponding operation. If c_{i} is equal to '+' or '-' then it's followed by a space and an integer a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 10^18) given without leading zeroes (unless it's 0). If c_{i} equals '?' then it's followed by a space and a sequence of zeroes and onse, giving the pattern of length no more than 18. It's guaranteed that there will be at least one query of type '?'. It's guaranteed that any time some integer is removed from the multiset, there will be at least one occurrence of this integer in it. -----Output----- For each query of the third type print the number of integers matching the given pattern. Each integer is counted as many times, as it appears in the multiset at this moment of time. -----Examples----- Input 12 + 1 + 241 ? 1 + 361 - 241 ? 0101 + 101 ? 101 - 101 ? 101 + 4000 ? 0 Output 2 1 2 1 1 Input 4 + 200 + 200 - 200 ? 0 Output 1 -----Note----- Consider the integers matching the patterns from the queries of the third type. Queries are numbered in the order they appear in the input.   1 and 241.  361.  101 and 361.  361.  4000.
