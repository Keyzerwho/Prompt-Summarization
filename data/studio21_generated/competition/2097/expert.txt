 You have a tree with weighted edges. You have to find the maximum possible value of f(p) where p is some sequence containing integers from 1 to n. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000). Each of the next n - 1 lines contains three integers a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n; 1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10000), denoting an edge between a_{i} and b_{i} with length c_{i}. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree. Each of the next n lines describes an element of sequence x. The j-th line contains an integer x_{j} (1 ≤ x_{j} ≤ n). -----Output----- Print a single integer representing the answer. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 1 1 1 1 Output 2 Input 4 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 4 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample, one of the optimal p is [4, 3, 2, 1].
