 You are given initial state of the startups. For each startup, you are told if it is either acquired or active. If it is acquired, you are also given the index of the active startup that it is following. You're now wondering, what is the expected number of days needed for this process to finish with exactly one active startup at the end. It can be shown the expected number of days can be written as a rational number $P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are co-prime integers, and $Q \not= 0 \pmod{10^9+7}$. Return the value of $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 500$), the number of startups. The next line will contain $n$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($a_i = -1$ or $1 \leq a_i \leq n$). If $a_i = -1$, then that means startup $i$ is active. Otherwise, if $1 \leq a_i \leq n$, then startup $i$ is acquired, and it is currently following startup $a_i$. It is guaranteed if $a_i \not= -1$, then $a_{a_i} =-1$ (that is, all startups that are being followed are active). -----Output----- Print a single integer, the expected number of days needed for the process to end with exactly one active startup, modulo $10^9+7$. -----Examples----- Input 3 -1 -1 -1 Output 3 Input 2 2 -1 Output 0 Input 40 3 3 -1 -1 4 4 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 20 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Output 755808950 -----Note----- In the first sample, there are three active startups labeled $1$, $2$ and $3$, and zero acquired startups. Here's an example of how one scenario can happen  Startup $1$ acquires startup $2$ (This state can be represented by the array $[-1, 1, -1]$)  Startup $3$ acquires startup $1$ (This state can be represented by the array $[3, -1, -1]$)  Startup $2$ acquires startup $3$ (This state can be represented by the array $[-1, -1, 2]$).  Startup $2$ acquires startup $1$ (This state can be represented by the array $[2, -1, 2]$).  At this point, there is only one active startup, and this sequence of steps took $4$ days. It can be shown the expected number of days is $3$. For the second sample, there is only one active startup, so we need zero days. For the last sample, remember to take the answer modulo $10^9+7$.
