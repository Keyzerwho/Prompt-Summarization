 The input given are $n$ non-negative integers. You need to find the maximum amount of gasoline that Nut can buy. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of cities. The second line contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ ($0 \leq w_{i} \leq 10^9$) — the maximum amounts of liters of gasoline that Nut can buy in cities. Each of the next $n - 1$ lines describes road and contains three integers $u$, $v$, $c$ ($1 \leq u, v \leq n$, $1 \leq c \leq 10^9$, $u \ne v$), where $u$ and $v$ — cities that are connected by this road and $c$ — its length. It is guaranteed that graph of road connectivity is a tree. -----Output----- Print one number — the maximum amount of gasoline that he can have at the end of the path. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 3 3 1 2 2 1 3 2 Output 3 Input 5 6 3 2 5 0 1 2 10 2 3 3 2 4 1 1 5 1 Output 7 -----Note----- The optimal way in the first example is $2 \to 1 \to 3$.
