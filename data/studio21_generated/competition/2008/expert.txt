 You are given a sequence of zeros and ones. You need to determine whether the sequence ever becomes stable. 
-----Input----- The first input line of the input contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 500 000) — the length of the initial sequence. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (a_{i} = 0 or a_{i} = 1), giving the initial sequence itself. -----Output----- If the sequence will never become stable, print a single number  - 1. Otherwise, first print a single integer — the minimum number of times one needs to apply the median smoothing algorithm to the initial sequence before it becomes is stable. In the second line print n numbers separated by a space  — the resulting sequence itself. -----Examples----- Input 4 0 0 1 1 Output 0 0 0 1 1 Input 5 0 1 0 1 0 Output 2 0 0 0 0 0 -----Note----- In the second sample the stabilization occurs in two steps: $01010 \rightarrow 00100 \rightarrow 00000$, and the sequence 00000 is obviously stable.
