 Vova and Marina love offering puzzles to each other. Today Marina offered Vova to cope with the following task. Vova has a non-directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges without loops and multiple edges. Let's define the operation of contraction two vertices a and b that are not connected by an edge. As a result of this operation vertices a and b are deleted and instead of them a new vertex x is added into the graph, and also edges are drawn from it to all vertices that were connected with a or with b (specifically, if the vertex was connected with both a and b, then also exactly one edge is added from x to it). Thus
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the original graph. Next m lines contain the descriptions of edges in the format a_{i}, b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n, a_{i} ≠ b_{i}), which means that there is an edge between vertices a_{i} and b_{i}. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertexes. -----Output----- If it is impossible to obtain a chain from the given graph, print  - 1. Otherwise, print the maximum possible number of edges in the resulting chain. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5 Output 3 Input 4 6 1 2 2 3 1 3 3 4 2 4 1 4 Output -1 Input 4 2 1 3 2 4 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample test you can contract vertices 4 and 5 and obtain a chain of length 3. In the second sample test it is initially impossible to contract any pair of vertexes, so it is impossible to achieve the desired result. In the third sample test you can contract vertices 1 and 2 and obtain a chain of length 2.
