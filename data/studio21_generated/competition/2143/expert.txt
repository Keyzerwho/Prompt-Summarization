 You are given 2 integers n and m, where n is the number of fountains and m is the number of coins and diamonds. You need to return an array (or two) of integers where each integer is the total beauty for each fountain. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds Arkady has. The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers b_{i} and p_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i}, p_{i} ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter "C" or "D", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively. -----Output----- Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains Arkady can build. If he can't build two fountains, print 0. -----Examples----- Input 3 7 6 10 8 C 4 3 C 5 6 D Output 9 Input 2 4 5 2 5 C 2 1 D Output 0 Input 3 10 10 5 5 C 5 5 C 10 11 D Output 10 -----Note----- In the first example Arkady should build the second fountain with beauty 4, which costs 3 coins. The first fountain he can't build because he don't have enough coins. Also Arkady should build the third fountain with beauty 5 which costs 6 diamonds. Thus the total beauty of built fountains is 9. In the second example there are two fountains, but Arkady can't build both of them, because he needs 5 coins for the first fountain, and Arkady has only 4 coins.
