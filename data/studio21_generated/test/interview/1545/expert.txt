 You have a message s of length n. You want to send it as a birthday present to your friend Moaz who likes strings. The message contains some characters that can't be written on a magical paper. You need to split the message into some non-empty substrings so that you can write every substring on an independent magical paper and fulfill the condition. The sum of their lengths should be n and they shouldn't overlap. For example, if n_1 = 2 and you want send string "aaa", you can split it into "a" and "aa" and use 2 magical papers, or into "a", "a" and "a" and use 3 magical papers. You can't split it into "aa" and "aa" because the sum of their lengths is greater than n. You can split the message into single string if it fulfills the conditions. A substring of string s is a string that consists of some consecutive characters from string s, strings "ab", "abc" and "b" are substrings of string "abc", while strings "acb" and "ac" are not. Any string is a substring of itself. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) denoting the length of the message. The second line contains the message s of length n that consists of lowercase English letters. The third line contains 26 integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_26 (1 ≤ a_{x} ≤ 10^3) — the maximum lengths of substring each letter can appear in. -----Output----- Print three lines. In the first line print the number of ways to split the message into substrings and fulfill the conditions mentioned in the problem modulo 10^9  +  7. In the second line print the length of the longest substring over all the ways. In the third line print the minimum number of substrings over all the ways. -----Examples----- Input 3 aab 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 3 2 2 Input 10 abcdeabcde 5 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 401 4 3 -----Note----- In the first example the three ways to split the message are:   a|a|b  aa|b  a|ab  The longest substrings are "aa" and "ab" of length 2. The minimum number of substrings is 2 in "a|ab" or "aa|b". Notice that "aab" is not a possible splitting because the letter 'a' appears in a substring of length 3, while a_1 = 2.
