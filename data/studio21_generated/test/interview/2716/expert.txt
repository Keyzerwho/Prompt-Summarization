 You are given two integers $N$ and $t$; and then an array $A$ of $N$ integers ($0$-based indexing). Based on the value of $t$, you will perform an action on $A$. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer $N$ and $t$ ($3 \leq N \leq 200000$; $1 \leq t \leq 5$).  The second line of the input contains $N$ non-negative $32$-bit signed integers. -----Output----- For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of $t$. -----Scoring----- There are $20$ hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.  All $20$ test cases will be tested.  Each hidden test case worth $5$ points (the $5$ sample test cases below worth $0$ point). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 1 1 7770 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 1: Yes Sample Input 2: 7 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 2: Unique Sample Input 3: 7 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 Sample Output 3: 1 Sample Input 4: 8 4 8 1 4 3 6 7 5 2 Sample Output 4: 4 5
