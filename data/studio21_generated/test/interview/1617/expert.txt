 You are given $n$ people and a ball. You need to find how many ways the ball can be passed around.
-----Input----- The only line consists of a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^9$) — the number of people playing with the ball. -----Output----- Suppose the set of all fun values is $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_m$. Output a single line containing $m$ space separated integers $f_1$ through $f_m$ in increasing order. -----Examples----- Input 6 Output 1 5 9 21 Input 16 Output 1 10 28 64 136 -----Note----- In the first sample, we've already shown that picking $k = 4$ yields fun value $9$, as does $k = 2$. Picking $k = 6$ results in fun value of $1$. For $k = 3$ we get fun value $5$ and with $k = 1$ or $k = 5$ we get $21$.  [Image]  In the second sample, the values $1$, $10$, $28$, $64$ and $136$ are achieved for instance for $k = 16$, $8$, $4$, $10$ and $11$, respectively.
