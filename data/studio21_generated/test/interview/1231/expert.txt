 You are given an array of integers. Calculate the number of steps with even and odd numbers. 
-----Input----- In the only line you are given two integers a, b (0 ≤ a, b ≤ 100) — the number of even and odd steps, accordingly. -----Output----- In the only line print "YES", if the interval of steps described above exists, and "NO" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 Output YES Input 3 1 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example one of suitable intervals is from 1 to 5. The interval contains two even steps — 2 and 4, and three odd: 1, 3 and 5.
