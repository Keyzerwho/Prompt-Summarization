 Given $K$ students standing in queue, determine the minimal number of minutes necessary for Ante to achieve his goal. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq N \leq 100000)$. The integer $N$ is going to divisible by $K$. The second line contains $N$ space separated integers $v_ i$ ($1 \leq v_ i \leq 10^9$), the $i$-th number denotes the skill of the $i$-th player standing in queue â€“ lower value means higher skill. All contestants are going to have distinct levels of skill. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the minimal required number of minutes. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 1 9 12 5 13 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 6 2 16 2 1 7 5 10 Sample Output 2: 1
