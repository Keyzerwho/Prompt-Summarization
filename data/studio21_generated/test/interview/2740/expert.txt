 Given two numbers m and w, return the number of different mountain scenes that can be formed given m inches of ribbon and w inches of frame. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The input will consist of a single line with three space-separated integers $n$, $w$ and $h$, where $n$ ($0 \le n \le 10000$) is the length of the ribbon in inches, $w$ ($1 \le w \le 100$) is the width and $h$ ($1 \le h \le 100$) is the height of the frame, both in inches. -----Output----- Output a single integer, indicating the total number of mountain scenes our artist could possibly make, modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 25 5 5 Sample Output 1: 7770 Sample Input 2: 15 5 5 Sample Output 2: 6050 Sample Input 3: 10 10 1 Sample Output 3: 1022
