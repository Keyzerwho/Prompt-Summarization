 You are given following inputs: chessboard with width $W$ and height $H$, rook's initial position $(r_0,c_0)$, pair of spells $(x,y)$.  Rook can move from $(r_0,c_0)$ into the cell $(r_1,c_1)$ only under the condition that $r_1 = r_0$ or $c_1 = c_0$ and there is no blocking lines or blocking segments between these cells.  Rook can remove spells, but for this it has to put tremendous efforts. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($0 \le n,m \le 10^5$) — the number of vertical and horizontal spells. Each of the following $n$ lines contains one integer $x$ ($1 \le x < 10^9$) — the description of the vertical spell. It will create a blocking line between the columns of $x$ and $x+1$. Each of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $x_1$, $x_2$ and $y$ ($1 \le x_{1} \le x_{2} \le 10^9$, $1 \le y < 10^9$) — the numbers that describe the horizontal spell. It will create a blocking segment that passes through the top sides of the cells that are in the row with the number $y$, in columns from $x_1$ to $x_2$ inclusive. It is guaranteed that all spells are different, as well as the fact that for each pair of horizontal spells it is true that the segments that describe them do not have common points. -----Output----- In a single line print one integer — the minimum number of spells the rook needs to remove so it can get from the cell $(1,1)$ to at least one cell in the row with the number $10^9$ -----Examples----- Input 2 3 6 8 1 5 6 1 9 4 2 4 2 Output 1 Input 1 3 4 1 5 3 1 9 4 4 6 6 Output 1 Input 0 2 1 1000000000 4 1 1000000000 2 Output 2 Input 0 0 Output 0 Input 2 3 4 6 1 4 3 1 5 2 1 6 5 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample, in order for the rook return home, it is enough to remove the second horizontal spell.  [Image] Illustration for the first sample. On the left it shows how the field looked at the beginning. On the right it shows how the field looked after the deletion of the second horizontal spell. It also shows the path, on which the rook would be going home.  In the second sample, in order for the rook to return home, it is enough to remove the only vertical spell. If we tried to remove just one of the horizontal spells, it would not allow the rook to get home, because it would be blocked from above by one of the remaining horizontal spells (either first one or second one), and to the right it would be blocked by a vertical spell.  $m$ Illustration for the second sample. On the left it shows how the field looked at the beginning. On the right it shows how it looked after the deletion of the vertical spell. It also shows the path, on which the rook would be going home.  In the third sample, we have two horizontal spells that go through the whole field. These spells can not be bypassed, so we need to remove both of them.  [Image] Illustration for the third sample. On the left it shows how the field looked at the beginning. On the right it shows how the field looked after the deletion of the horizontal spells. It also shows the path, on which the rook would be going home.  In the fourth sample, we have no spells, which means that we do not need to remove anything. In the fifth example, we can remove the first vertical and third horizontal spells.

It also shows the path, on which the rook would be going home.
