 You are given a binary string. Decode it to get an integer. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 89) — length of the string s. The second line contains string s — sequence of '0' and '1' characters, number in its encoded format. It is guaranteed that the number corresponding to the string is positive and doesn't exceed 10^9. The string always starts with '1'. -----Output----- Print the decoded number. -----Examples----- Input 3 111 Output 3 Input 9 110011101 Output 2031
