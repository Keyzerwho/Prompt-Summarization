 You are given an array of size $n$ and m ($n>m$). The i-th row and j-th column are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and from 1 to m, from left to right. The i-th cell of the array is represented as (i, j). The figure below shows how the i-th row and j-th column of the candy matrix look like. [Image]  Inna and Dima decided to surprise Sereja. They brought a really huge candy matrix, it's big even for Sereja! Let's number the rows of the giant matrix from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns   from 1 to m, from left to right. We'll represent the cell on the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column as (i, j). Just as is expected, some cells of the giant candy matrix contain candies. Overall the matrix has p candies: the k-th candy is at cell (x_{k}, y_{k}). The time moved closer to dinner and Inna was already going to eat p of her favourite sweets from the matrix, when suddenly
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains fix integers n, m, x, y, z, p (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ p ≤ 10^5). Each of the following p lines contains two integers x_{k}, y_{k} (1 ≤ x_{k} ≤ n; 1 ≤ y_{k} ≤ m) — the initial coordinates of the k-th candy. Two candies can lie on the same cell. -----Output----- For each of the p candies, print on a single line its space-separated new coordinates. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 3 1 1 9 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 3 Output 1 3 1 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 1 3 3 3 2 3 1 -----Note----- Just for clarity. Horizontal rotating is like a mirroring of the matrix. For matrix: QWER      REWQ  ASDF  ->  FDSA ZXCV      VCXZ
