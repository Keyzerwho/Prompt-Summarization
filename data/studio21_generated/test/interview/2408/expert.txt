 You are given two arrays $A$ and $B$. $A$ contains $n$ integers, $B$ contains $m$ integers. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $B$ are sorted in ascending order. $A$ and $
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — the number of electric poles. Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($-10^4 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^4$) — the coordinates of the poles. It is guaranteed that all of these $n$ points are distinct. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of pairs of wires that are intersecting. -----Examples----- Input 4 0 0 1 1 0 3 1 2 Output 14 Input 4 0 0 0 2 0 4 2 0 Output 6 Input 3 -1 -1 1 0 3 1 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example: [Image]  In the second example: [Image]  Note that the three poles $(0, 0)$, $(0, 2)$ and $(0, 4)$ are connected by a single wire. In the third example: [Image]
