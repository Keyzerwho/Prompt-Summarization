 Help Valera count the minimum number of cashes to work at his cafe next day, so that they can serve all visitors. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), that is the number of cafe visitors. Each of the following n lines has two space-separated integers h_{i} and m_{i} (0 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 23; 0 ≤ m_{i} ≤ 59), representing the time when the i-th person comes into the cafe.  Note that the time is given in the chronological order. All time is given within one 24-hour period. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of cashes, needed to serve all clients next day. -----Examples----- Input 4 8 0 8 10 8 10 8 45 Output 2 Input 3 0 12 10 11 22 22 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first sample it is not enough one cash to serve all clients, because two visitors will come into cafe in 8:10. Therefore, if there will be one cash in cafe, then one customer will be served by it, and another one will not wait and will go away. In the second sample all visitors will come in different times, so it will be enough one cash.
