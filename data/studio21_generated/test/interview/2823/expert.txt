 You task is to insert some characters into some places, so that the resulting sequence contains a swine gene somewhere. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a sequence of $N$ ($1 \le N \le 10000$) characters which represent the apple’s DNA. The second line of input contains a sequence of $M$ ($1 \le M \le 5000$) characters which represent the swine gene that we want to insert into the apple’s DNA. Both the sequences are comprised only of characters from the set $\{ A, C, G, T\} $. The third line of input contains four integers from the interval $[0, 1000]$: the cost of inserting one character $A, C, G, T$, in that order. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the minimal total cost. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: GTA CAT 5 7 1 3 Sample Output 1: 10 Sample Input 2: TATA CACA 3 0 3 0 Sample Output 2: 3
