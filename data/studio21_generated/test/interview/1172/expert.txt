 The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: S -----Output----- Print the sum of the ABC numbers of all the 3^Q strings, modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Sample Input----- A??C -----Sample Output----- 8 In this case, Q = 2, and we can make 3^Q = 9 strings by by replacing each occurrence of ? with A, B or C. The ABC number of each of these strings is as follows:  - AAAC: 0  - AABC: 2  - AACC: 0  - ABAC: 1  - ABBC: 2  - ABCC: 2  - ACAC: 0  - ACBC: 1  - ACCC: 0 The sum of these is 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 8, so we print 8 modulo 10^9 + 7, that is, 8.
