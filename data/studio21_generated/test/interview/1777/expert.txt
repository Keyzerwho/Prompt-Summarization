 You are given many (not necessarily correct) bracket sequences. You need to connect some of them into ordered pairs so that each bracket sequence occurs in at most one pair and the concatenation of the bracket sequences in each pair is a correct bracket sequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the number of bracket sequences. Each of the following $n$ lines contains one bracket sequence — a non-empty string which consists only of characters "(" and ")". The sum of lengths of all bracket sequences in the input is at most $5 \cdot 10^5$. Note that a bracket sequence may appear in the input multiple times. In this case, you can use each copy of the sequence separately. Also note that the order in which strings appear in the input doesn't matter. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of pairs which can be made, adhering to the conditions in the statement. -----Examples----- Input 7 )()) ) (( (( ( ) ) Output 2 Input 4 ( (( ((( (()) Output 0 Input 2 (()) () Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example, it's optimal to construct two pairs: "((     )())" and "(     )".
