 You are given an array of numbers. Make sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of boxes. Each of the next 2n lines of input starts with a string "add" or "remove". If the line starts with the "add", an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) follows, indicating that Daru should add the box with number x to the top of the stack.  It is guaranteed that exactly n lines contain "add" operations, all the boxes added are distinct, and n lines contain "remove" operations. It is also guaranteed that a box is always added before it is required to be removed. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of times Daru needs to reorder the boxes to successfully complete all of Okabe's commands. -----Examples----- Input 3 add 1 remove add 2 add 3 remove remove Output 1 Input 7 add 3 add 2 add 1 remove add 4 remove remove remove add 6 add 7 add 5 remove remove remove Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample, Daru should reorder the boxes after adding box 3 to the stack. In the second sample, Daru should reorder the boxes after adding box 4 and box 7 to the stack.
