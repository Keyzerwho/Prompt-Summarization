 You are given a graph with N vertices and M edges. You need to traverse the graph and collect coins. You need to collect coins along edges, but coins that you have already collected will reappear. You need to reach Vertex N and press the stop button. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M P A_1 B_1 C_1 : A_M B_M C_M -----Output----- If there exists a maximum value of the score that can be obtained, print that maximum value; otherwise, print -1. -----Sample Input----- 3 3 10 1 2 20 2 3 30 1 3 45 -----Sample Output----- 35 There are two ways to travel from Vertex 1 to Vertex 3:  - Vertex 1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3: You collect 20 + 30 = 50 coins on the way. After two minutes from the start of the game, you press the button, pay 2 \times 10 = 20 coins, and you have 50 - 20 = 30 coins left.  - Vertex 1 \rightarrow 2: You collect 45 coins on the way. After one minute from the start of the game, you press the button, pay 1 \times 10 = 10 coins, and you have 45 - 10 = 35 coins left. Thus, the maximum score that can be obtained is 35.
