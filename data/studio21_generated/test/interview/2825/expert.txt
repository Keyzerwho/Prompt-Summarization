 You are given four integers (1, 2, 7, and 10). Create a matrix numbered from 1 to 4 with 4 rows and 2 columns. Each student has a maximum pace at which he or she is able to travel, yet if a pair of students are walking under the cloak together, they will have to travel at the pace of the slower of the two. 
-----Input----- The input is a single line beginning with an integer, $2 \leq N \leq 15$. Following that are $N$ positive integers that respectively represent the minimum time in which each person is able to cross the campus if alone; these times are measured in minutes, with each being at most $5000$. (It is a very large campus!) -----Output----- Output the minimum possible time it takes to get the entire group from the gate to the dorm. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 15 5 Sample Output 1: 15 Sample Input 2: 4 1 2 7 10 Sample Output 2: 17
