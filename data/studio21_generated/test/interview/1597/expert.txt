 You are given n students and n pseudonyms. You need to find the matching between students and pseudonyms with the maximum quality. 
-----Input----- The first line contains number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of students in the summer school. Next n lines contain the name of the students. Each name is a non-empty word consisting of lowercase English letters. Some names can be repeating. The last n lines contain the given pseudonyms. Each pseudonym is a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. Some pseudonyms can be repeating. The total length of all the names and pseudonyms doesn't exceed 800 000 characters. -----Output----- In the first line print the maximum possible quality of matching pseudonyms to students. In the next n lines describe the optimal matching. Each line must have the form a b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n), that means that the student who was number a in the input, must match to the pseudonym number b in the input. The matching should be a one-to-one correspondence, that is, each student and each pseudonym should occur exactly once in your output. If there are several optimal answers, output any. -----Examples----- Input 5 gennady galya boris bill toshik bilbo torin gendalf smaug galadriel Output 11 4 1 2 5 1 3 5 2 3 4 -----Note----- The first test from the statement the match looks as follows:   bill  →  bilbo (lcp = 3)  galya  →  galadriel (lcp = 3)  gennady  →  gendalf (lcp = 3)  toshik  →  torin (lcp = 2)  boris  →  smaug (lcp = 0)
