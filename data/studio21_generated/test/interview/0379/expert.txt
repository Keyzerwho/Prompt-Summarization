 You are given two numbers n and m. Determine if it is possible to make a rectangle from these two numbers. The rectangle should be solid, i.e. there should be no empty holes inside it or on its border. 
-----Input----- The first line of input will contain two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), the dimensions of the puzzle piece. The next n lines will describe the jigsaw piece. Each line will have length m and will consist of characters '.' and 'X' only. 'X' corresponds to a part of the puzzle piece, '.' is an empty space. It is guaranteed there is at least one 'X' character in the input and that the 'X' characters form a 4-connected region. -----Output----- Output "YES" if it is possible for Hongcow to make a rectangle. Output "NO" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 XXX XXX Output YES Input 2 2 .X XX Output NO Input 5 5 ..... ..X.. ..... ..... ..... Output YES -----Note----- For the first sample, one example of a rectangle we can form is as follows  111222 111222 For the second sample, it is impossible to put two of those pieces without rotating or flipping to form a rectangle. In the third sample, we can shift the first tile by one to the right, and then compose the following rectangle:  ..... ..XX. ..... ..... .....
