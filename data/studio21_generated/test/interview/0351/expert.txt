 Given a list of n problems (a list of positive integers), y positive integer, and d positive integer, find the number of problems (y positive integer) on at least one judge besides Decoforces, that Makes should solve in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The second line contains n space-separated integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print minimum number of problems Makes should solve on other judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 2 1 9 Output 1 Input 4 20 10 3 6 3 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example Makes at first solves problems 1 and 2. Then in order to solve the problem with difficulty 9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less than 5. The only available are difficulties 5 and 6 on some other judge. Solving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem 3. In the second example he can solve every problem right from the start.
