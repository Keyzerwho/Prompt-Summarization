 You are given $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. For exampe, in the picture there are $n=4$ people and $5$ chains. The first person knows passcodes of two chains: $1-4$ and $1-2$. The fridge $1$ can be open by its owner (the person $1$), also two people $2$ and $4$ (acting together) can open it.  The weights of these fridges are $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. To make a steel chain connecting fridges $u$ and $v$, you have to pay $a_u + a_v$ dollars. Note that the landlord allows you to create multiple chains connecting the same pair of fridges.  Hanh's apartment landlord asks you to create exactly $m$ steel chains so that all fridges are private. A fridge is private if and only if, among $n$ people living in the apartment, only the owner can open it (i.e. no other person acting alone can do it). In other words, the fridge $i$ is not
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10$). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \le n \le 1000$, $1 \le m \le n$) — the number of people living in Hanh's apartment and the number of steel chains that the landlord requires, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^4$) — weights of all fridges. -----Output----- For each test case:   If there is no solution, print a single integer $-1$.  Otherwise, print a single integer $c$ — the minimum total cost. The $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), meaning that the $i$-th steel chain connects fridges $u_i$ and $v_i$. An arbitrary number of chains can be between a pair of fridges.  If there are multiple answers, print any. -----Example----- Input 3 4 4 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 2 3 3 3 1 2 3 Output 8 1 2 4 3 3 2 4 1 -1 12 3 2 1 2 3 1
