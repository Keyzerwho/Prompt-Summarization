 You are given $n$ piles of stones. You need to output who will win the game. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 50$) — the number of piles. It is guaranteed that $n$ is an even number. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 50$) — the number of stones in the piles. -----Output----- Print a single string "Alice" if Alice wins; otherwise, print "Bob" (without double quotes). -----Examples----- Input 2 8 8 Output Bob Input 4 3 1 4 1 Output Alice -----Note----- In the first example, each player can only remove stones from one pile ($\frac{2}{2}=1$). Alice loses, since Bob can copy whatever Alice does on the other pile, so Alice will run out of moves first. In the second example, Alice can remove $2$ stones from the first pile and $3$ stones from the third pile on her first move to guarantee a win.
