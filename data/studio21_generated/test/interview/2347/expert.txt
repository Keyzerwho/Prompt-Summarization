 You are given a password $p$ and the hash $h$. Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a non-empty string $p$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $p$ does not exceed $100$. The second line of each test case contains a non-empty string $h$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of $h$ does not exceed $100$. -----Output----- For each test case print the answer to it — "YES" if the given hash $h$ could be obtained from the given password $p$ or "NO" otherwise. -----Example----- Input 5 abacaba zyxaabcaabkjh onetwothree threetwoone one zzonneyy one none twenty ten Output YES YES NO YES NO -----Note----- The first test case is explained in the statement. In the second test case both $s_1$ and $s_2$ are empty and $p'=$ "threetwoone" is $p$ shuffled. In the third test case the hash could not be obtained from the password. In the fourth test case $s_1=$ "n", $s_2$ is empty and $p'=$ "one" is $p$ shuffled (even thought it stayed the same).  In the fifth test case the hash could not be obtained from the password.
