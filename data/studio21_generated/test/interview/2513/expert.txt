 You are given a string of length N consisting of o and x. Find a valid assignment of species to the animals that is consistent with these responses. 
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N s -----Output----- If there does not exist an valid assignment that is consistent with s, print -1. Otherwise, print an string t in the following format. The output is considered correct if the assignment described by t is consistent with s.  - t is a string of length N consisting of S and W.  - If t_i is S, it indicates that the animal numbered i is a sheep. If t_i is W, it indicates that the animal numbered i is a wolf. -----Sample Input----- 6 ooxoox -----Sample Output----- SSSWWS For example, if the animals numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are respectively a sheep, sheep, sheep, wolf, wolf, and sheep, it is consistent with their responses. Besides, there is another valid assignment of species: a wolf, sheep, wolf, sheep, wolf and wolf. Let us remind you: if the neiboring animals are of the same species, a sheep answers o and a wolf answers x. If the neiboring animals are of different species, a sheep answers x and a wolf answers o.
