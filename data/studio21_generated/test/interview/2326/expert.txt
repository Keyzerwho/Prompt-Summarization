 You are given a sequence of integers.  You need to count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the number $n~(1 \le n \le 10^3)$ — the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n~(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — the sequence itself. -----Output----- In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 1 Output 2 Input 4 1 1 1 1 Output 7 -----Note----- In the first test case, two good subsequences — $[a_1, a_2, a_3]$ and $[a_2, a_3]$. In the second test case, seven good subsequences — $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4], [a_1, a_2], [a_1, a_3], [a_1, a_4], [a_2, a_3], [a_2, a_4]$ and $[a_3, a_4]$.
