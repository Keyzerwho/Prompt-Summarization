 The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution. You need to output the number of such pairs. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n (1  ≤ n  ≤  2·10^5) — the number of seasons. The second line contains n integers separated by space a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — number of episodes in each season. -----Output----- Print one integer — the number of pairs x and y (x < y) such that there exist both season x episode y and season y episode x. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 0 Input 3 8 12 7 Output 3 Input 3 3 2 1 Output 2 -----Note----- Possible pairs in the second example:  x = 1, y = 2 (season 1 episode 2 [Image] season 2 episode 1);  x = 2, y = 3 (season 2 episode 3 [Image] season 3 episode 2);  x = 1, y = 3 (season 1 episode 3 [Image] season 3 episode 1).  In the third example:  x = 1, y = 2 (season 1 episode 2 [Image] season 2 episode 1);  x = 1, y = 3 (season 1 episode 3 [Image] season 3 episode 1).
