 You are given a non-empty string S, and an integer k, where  k  is the length of the (typing) cursor. S  contains a valid input if and only if S  contains only characters  < ,  [ ,  ]  and  ]  and  k  is the number of valid characters in S . 
-----Input----- The input starts with a line containing just one integer $T \: (1 \le T \le 10)$, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is a line containing the string that was written in the Text Editor Sim (Steven IMproved). The length of the string is at most $10^{6}$, and it will only contain lowercase letters from the English alphabet [‘$a$’$\; \ldots \; $‘$z$’], digits [‘$0$’$\; \ldots \; $‘$9$’], spaces, as well as some of the three special characters: ‘<’, ‘[’, or ‘]’. -----Output----- For each test case, output one line containing the final string that is displayed on screen. -----Subtasks-----  - $\textbf{(27.5 points)}$: $1 \le T \le 10$, string length is at most $10^{3}$, there is no ‘[’, as seen in sample $1$.  - $\textbf{(32.5 points)}$: $1 \le T \le 10$, string length is at most $10^{3}$, there may be ‘[’, as seen in sample $2$.  - $\textbf{(40 points)}$: $1 \le T \le 4$, string length is at most $10^{6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 my ]]name]] is]] steva<en]<n halim]]]]] Sample Output: my name is steven halim
