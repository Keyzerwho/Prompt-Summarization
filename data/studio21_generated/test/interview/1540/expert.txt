 
-----Input----- The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^4; 1 ≤ m ≤ 10; 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of the employees, the number of chats and the number of events in the log, correspondingly.  Next n lines contain matrix a of size n × m, consisting of numbers zero and one. The element of this matrix, recorded in the j-th column of the i-th line, (let's denote it as a_{ij}) equals 1, if the i-th employee is the participant of the j-th chat, otherwise the element equals 0. Assume that the employees are numbered from 1 to n and the chats are numbered from 1 to m. Next k lines contain the description of the log events. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers x_{i} and y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n; 1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ m) which mean that the employee number x_{i} sent one message to chat number y_{i}. It is guaranteed that employee number x_{i} is a participant of chat y_{i}. It is guaranteed that each chat contains at least two employees. -----Output----- Print in the single line n space-separated integers, where the i-th integer shows the number of message notifications the i-th employee receives. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 5 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 3 1 1 3 2 4 3 2 Output 3 3 1  Input 4 3 4 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 3 Output 0 2 3 0
