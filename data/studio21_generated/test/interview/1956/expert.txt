 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of rounds the game has.  Then $t$ lines follow, each contains two integers $s_i$ and $e_i$ ($1 \le s_i \le e_i \le 10^{18}$) — the $i$-th round's information. The rounds are played in the same order as given in input, $s_i$ and $e_i$ for all rounds are known to everyone before the game starts. -----Output----- Print two integers. The first one should be 1 if Lee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves, and 0 otherwise. The second one should be 1 if Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's moves, and 0 otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 8 1 4 3 10 Output 1 1 Input 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 Output 0 0 Input 1 1 1 Output 0 1 Input 2 1 9 4 5 Output 0 0 Input 2 1 2 2 8 Output 1 0 Input 6 216986951114298167 235031205335543871 148302405431848579 455670351549314242 506251128322958430 575521452907339082 1 768614336404564650 189336074809158272 622104412002885672 588320087414024192 662540324268197150 Output 1 0 -----Note----- Remember, whoever writes an integer greater than $e_i$ loses.
