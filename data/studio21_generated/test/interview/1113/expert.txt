 You are given an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Your goal is to determine for a given array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ the minimum step $t$ such that he has definitely made a mistake on at least one of the steps $1, 2, \ldots, t$, or determine that he could have obtained this array without mistakes. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100\,000$) — the number of steps Ildar made. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the array Ildar obtained. -----Output----- If Ildar could have chosen the subsets on each step in such a way that the resulting array is $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, print $-1$. Otherwise print a single integer $t$ — the smallest index of a step such that a mistake was made on at least one step among steps $1, 2, \ldots, t$. -----Examples----- Input 4 0 1 2 1 Output -1 Input 3 1 0 1 Output 1 Input 4 0 1 2 239 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first example it is possible that Ildar made no mistakes. Here is the process he could have followed.  $1$-st step. The initial array is empty. He can choose an empty subset and obtain $0$, because the mex of an empty set is $0$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0]$.  $2$-nd step. The current array is $[0]$. He can choose a subset $[0]$ and obtain an integer $1$, because $mex(0) = 1$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1]$.  $3$-rd step. The current array is $[0,1]$. He can choose a subset $[0,1]$ and obtain an integer $2$, because $mex(0,1) = 2$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1,2]$.  $4$-th step. The current array is $[0,1,2]$. He can choose a subset $[0]$ and obtain an integer $1$, because $mex(0) = 1$. Appending this value to the end he gets the array $[0,1,2,1]$.  Thus, he can get the array without mistakes, so the answer is $-1$. In the second example he has definitely made a mistake on the very first step, because he could not have obtained anything different from $0$. In the third example he could have obtained $[0, 1, 2]$ without mistakes, but $239$ is definitely wrong.
