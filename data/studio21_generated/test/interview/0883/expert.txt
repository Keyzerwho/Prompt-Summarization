 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the number of ways to show some number of fingers on one hand (one to five), so that Dima did not have to clean the place. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Dima's friends. Dima himself isn't considered to be his own friend. The second line contains n positive integers, not exceeding 5, representing, how many fingers the Dima's friends will show.  The numbers in the lines are separated by a single space. -----Output----- In a single line print the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 3 Input 1 2 Output 2 Input 2 3 5 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample Dima can show 1, 3 or 5 fingers. If Dima shows 3 fingers, then the counting-out will go like that: Dima, his friend, Dima, his friend. In the second sample Dima can show 2 or 4 fingers.
