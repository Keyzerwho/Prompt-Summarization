 You are given an integer $n$. Find the smallest number of $p$-binary numbers (not necessarily distinct) you need to represent $n$ as their sum. 
-----Input----- The only line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$, $-1000 \leq p \leq 1000$). -----Output----- If it is impossible to represent $n$ as the sum of any number of $p$-binary numbers, print a single integer $-1$. Otherwise, print the smallest possible number of summands. -----Examples----- Input 24 0 Output 2 Input 24 1 Output 3 Input 24 -1 Output 4 Input 4 -7 Output 2 Input 1 1 Output -1 -----Note----- $0$-binary numbers are just regular binary powers, thus in the first sample case we can represent $24 = (2^4 + 0) + (2^3 + 0)$. In the second sample case, we can represent $24 = (2^4 + 1) + (2^2 + 1) + (2^0 + 1)$. In the third sample case, we can represent $24 = (2^4 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1) + (2^2 - 1)$. Note that repeated summands are allowed. In the fourth sample case, we can represent $4 = (2^4 - 7) + (2^1 - 7)$. Note that the second summand is negative, which is allowed. In the fifth sample case, no representation is possible.
