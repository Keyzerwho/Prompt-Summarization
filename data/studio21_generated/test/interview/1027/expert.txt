 
-----Input----- The only line contains 14 integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{14}$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the number of stones in each hole. It is guaranteed that for any $i$ ($1\leq i \leq 14$) $a_i$ is either zero or odd, and there is at least one stone in the board. -----Output----- Output one integer, the maximum possible score after one move. -----Examples----- Input 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 Output 4 Input 5 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Output 8 -----Note----- In the first test case the board after the move from the hole with $7$ stones will look like 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1. Then the player collects the even numbers and ends up with a score equal to $4$.
