 
-----Input----- The first line of input will contain two integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000), the number of seats, and the number of passengers, respectively. -----Output----- Print a single number, the number of ways, modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Example----- Input 3 3 Output 128 -----Note----- Here, we will denote a passenger by which seat they were assigned, and which side they came from (either "F" or "B" for front or back, respectively). For example, one valid way is 3B, 3B, 3B (i.e. all passengers were assigned seat 3 and came from the back entrance). Another valid way would be 2F, 1B, 3F. One invalid way would be 2B, 2B, 2B, since the third passenger would get to the front without finding a seat.
