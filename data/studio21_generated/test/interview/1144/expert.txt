 You are given two strings s and t both of length n and both consisting of small English letters 'a' and 'b'. One move is defined as taking contiguous substring of both s and t and reversing it. You need to find if it is possible to make s and t after some sequence of moves 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of s. The second line contains the string s of length n. It contains small English letters 'a', 'b' and characters '?' only. The third line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the length of t. The string t contains letters 'a' on odd positions and 'b' on even positions. -----Output----- Print the only integer — the minimum number of replacements Vasya has to perform to make the beauty of string s the maximum possible. -----Examples----- Input 5 bb?a? 1 Output 2 Input 9 ab??ab??? 3 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample string t has a form 'a'. The only optimal option is to replace all characters '?' by 'a'. In the second sample using two replacements we can make string equal to "aba?aba??". It is impossible to get more than two occurrences.
