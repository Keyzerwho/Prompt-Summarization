 
-----Input----- The first and the only line contains the string s (4 ≤ |s| ≤ 100), which describes the garland, the i-th symbol of which describes the color of the i-th light bulb in the order from the beginning of garland:   'R' — the light bulb is red,  'B' — the light bulb is blue,  'Y' — the light bulb is yellow,  'G' — the light bulb is green,  '!' — the light bulb is dead.  The string s can not contain other symbols except those five which were described.  It is guaranteed that in the given string at least once there is each of four letters 'R', 'B', 'Y' and 'G'.  It is guaranteed that the string s is correct garland with some blown light bulbs, it means that for example the line "GRBY!!!B" can not be in the input data.  -----Output----- In the only line print four integers k_{r}, k_{b}, k_{y}, k_{g} — the number of dead light bulbs of red, blue, yellow and green colors accordingly. -----Examples----- Input RYBGRYBGR Output 0 0 0 0 Input !RGYB Output 0 1 0 0 Input !!!!YGRB Output 1 1 1 1 Input !GB!RG!Y! Output 2 1 1 0 -----Note----- In the first example there are no dead light bulbs. In the second example it is obvious that one blue bulb is blown, because it could not be light bulbs of other colors on its place according to the statements.
