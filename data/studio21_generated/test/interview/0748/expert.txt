 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the required partition. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 99999) — the number of elements in the sequence. The next line contains n positive integers, each of them is at most 7. It is guaranteed that n is divisible by 3. -----Output----- If the required partition exists, print $\frac{n}{3}$ groups of three. Print each group as values of the elements it contains. You should print values in increasing order. Separate the groups and integers in groups by whitespaces. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them. If there is no solution, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 6 1 1 1 2 2 2 Output -1 Input 6 2 2 1 1 4 6 Output 1 2 4 1 2 6
