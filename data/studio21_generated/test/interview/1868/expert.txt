 You have $n$ distinct strings $S$ and $T$, where $S = Pr_k$ and $T = Su_k$ for some $k$. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are reversed. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again. $Pr_k$ and $Su_k$ are swapped again.
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $|A|$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$, $1 \le m \le min(\frac n 2, 2 \cdot 10^5)$, $1 \le |A| \le 10^9$) — the length of the strings, the size of the array $b$ and the size of the set $A$, respectively. The second line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \le b_i \le \frac n 2$, $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_m$). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of distinct strings of length $n$ with characters from set $A$ modulo $998244353$. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 1 Output 6 Input 9 2 26 2 3 Output 150352234 Input 12 3 1 2 5 6 Output 1 -----Note----- Here are all the distinct strings for the first example. The chosen letters 'a' and 'b' are there just to show that the characters in $A$ are different.    "aaa"  "aab" = "baa"  "aba"  "abb" = "bba"  "bab"  "bbb"
