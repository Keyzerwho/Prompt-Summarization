 You are given a list of words. You need to output all lines in boustrophedon style. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input will consist of three numbers, $n$, the number of lines in the original inscription, $d$, the width of the original inscription, and $w$, the width of your new stone in characters. Then, $n$ lines follow containing the original inscription written in boustrophedon style. You may assume that the first $n-1$ such lines consist only of capital letters and periods, with the $n$-th line also possibly containing spaces. You may assume that no two periods appear consecutively, that $1\leq n \leq 100000$, $1\leq d\leq 100$, $1\leq w\leq 100$, and that no word is more than $w$ letters long. -----Output----- The output should consist of a single integer, representing the number of lines required to write the inscription when writing left to right and not splitting words across lines. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 24 24 IN.HONOR.OF.THE.INTERNAT TEPMOC.GNIMMARGORP.LANOI ITION Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 3 24 20 IN.HONOR.OF.THE.INTERNAT TEPMOC.GNIMMARGORP.LANOI ITION Sample Output 2: 4
