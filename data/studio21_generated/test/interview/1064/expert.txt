 you wants to get from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ by making multiple hops. you can only hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its $n$ favorite numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. What is the minimum number of hops you need to move from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$  you may land on points with non-integer coordinates. It can be proved that you can always reach his destination. Recall that the Euclidean distance between points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ is $\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}$. For example, if you have favorite numbers $1$ and $3$ he could hop from $(0,0)$ to $(4,0)$ in two hops as shown below. Note that there also exists other valid ways to hop to $(4,0)$ in $2$ hops
-----Input----- The first line contains three integer numbers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 10^6$, $0 \le m \le n$) — the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to illuminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the post lamp available. The second line contains $m$ integer numbers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_m$ ($0 \le s_1 < s_2 < \dots s_m < n$) — the blocked positions. The third line contains $k$ integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$) — the costs of the post lamps. -----Output----- Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment $[0; n]$ of the street. If illumintaing the entire segment $[0; n]$ is impossible, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 6 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 Output 6 Input 4 3 4 1 2 3 1 10 100 1000 Output 1000 Input 5 1 5 0 3 3 3 3 3 Output -1 Input 7 4 3 2 4 5 6 3 14 15 Output -1
