 Breads are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Breads can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent breads. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer $N, (3 \leq N \leq 100000)$, denoting the number of breads. Then two lines follow: On the first line, a permutation of the integers $1$ through $N$ describing the order in which the breads are lined up. On the second line, a permutation of the integers $1$ through $N$ describing how Michael’s boss wants the breads sorted. -----Output----- Output “Possible” if Michael can sort the breads with his paddle in the order prescribed by his boss, otherwise “Impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 3 4 2 4 3 2 1 Sample Output: Possible
