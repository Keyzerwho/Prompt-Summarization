 You are given an integer $n$. For every $k$, add $f(n)$ to $n$ exactly $k$ times (note that $n$ will change after each operation, so $f(n)$ may change too) and tell me the final value of $n$. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input is a single integer $t\ (1\le t\le 100)$: the number of times that Orac will ask you. Each of the next $t$ lines contains two positive integers $n,k\ (2\le n\le 10^6, 1\le k\le 10^9)$, corresponding to a query by Orac. It is guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ is at most $10^6$.  -----Output----- Print $t$ lines, the $i$-th of them should contain the final value of $n$ in the $i$-th query by Orac. -----Example----- Input 3 5 1 8 2 3 4 Output 10 12 12 -----Note----- In the first query, $n=5$ and $k=1$. The divisors of $5$ are $1$ and $5$, the smallest one except $1$ is $5$. Therefore, the only operation adds $f(5)=5$ to $5$, and the result is $10$. In the second query, $n=8$ and $k=2$. The divisors of $8$ are $1,2,4,8$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, then after one operation $8$ turns into $8+(f(8)=2)=10$. The divisors of $10$ are $1,2,5,10$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, therefore the answer is $10+(f(10)=2)=12$. In the third query, $n$ is changed as follows: $3 \to 6 \to 8 \to 10 \to 12$.
