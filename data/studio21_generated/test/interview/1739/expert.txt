 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the size of the array and the prime number. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_{n} ≤ 10^9).  -----Output----- Print a single number — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 2 2 2 2 Output 8 Input 3 3 1 2 3 Output 27 Input 2 2 29 29 Output 73741817 Input 4 5 0 0 0 0 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first sample $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4 + 4}{16} = \frac{8}{16}$. Thus, the answer to the problem is 8. In the second sample, $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{27} = \frac{243 + 81 + 27}{729} = \frac{351}{729}$. The answer to the problem is 27, as 351 = 13·27, 729 = 27·27. In the third sample the answer to the problem is 1073741824 mod 1000000007 = 73741817. In the fourth sample $\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1} = \frac{4}{1}$. Thus, the answer to the problem is 1.
