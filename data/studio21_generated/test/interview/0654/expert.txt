 Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 
-----Input----- The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$). -----Output----- Print exactly one integer — the size of the maximum matching in the trie. Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1 Input 2 Output 3 Input 3 Output 9 -----Note----- The pictures below illustrate tries in the first two examples (for clarity, the round brackets are replaced with angle brackets). The maximum matching is highlighted with blue. [Image] [Image]
