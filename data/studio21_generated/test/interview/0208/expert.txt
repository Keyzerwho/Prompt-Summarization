 You are given two coordinates. In one step, you can calculate the distance between two coordinates. Return the minimum number of steps required before the distance between two coordinates equals 1. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four space-separated x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) integers, where x_1 and y_1 are coordinates of the first tree and x_2 and y_2 are coordinates of the second tree. It's guaranteed that the given points are distinct. -----Output----- If there is no solution to the problem, print -1. Otherwise print four space-separated integers x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 that correspond to the coordinates of the two other trees. If there are several solutions you can output any of them.  Note that x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 must be in the range ( - 1000 ≤ x_3, y_3, x_4, y_4 ≤ 1000). -----Examples----- Input 0 0 0 1 Output 1 0 1 1 Input 0 0 1 1 Output 0 1 1 0 Input 0 0 1 2 Output -1
