 You are given $n$ cards. Draw a card from the deck. If this card is bigger than all cards you previously saw, stop. Otherwise, continue drawing cards for $c$ times. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $c$ denoting the number of cards in the deck ($0 < n \le 64$) and $c$ is the number of cards Jacob will definitely draw ($0 \le c < n$). The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_ i$ ($0 \le a_ i \le 10000$) - the numbers written on the cards in the deck, which may be given in any order. -----Output----- Output the expected score under Jacobâ€™s strategy. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-5}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 0 1 Sample Output 1: 0.500000 Sample Input 2: 4 2 0 4 8 6 Sample Output 2: 5.500000 Sample Input 3: 15 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Sample Output 3: 11.266667
