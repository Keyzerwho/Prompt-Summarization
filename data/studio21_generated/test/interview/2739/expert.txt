You are given $i+1$, the starting time of experiment $i+1$. You are given $i+2$, the starting time of experiment $i+2$. You are given $i+3$, the starting time of experiment $i+3$. You are given $i+4$, the starting time of experiment $i+4$. You are given $i+5$, the starting time of experiment $i+5$. You are given $i+6$, the starting time of experiment $i+6$. You are given $i+7$, the starting time of experiment $i+7$. You are given $i+8$, the starting time of experiment $i+8$. You are given $i+9$, the starting time of experiment $i+9$. You are given $i+10$, the starting
-----Input----- The input consists of two lines.  - The first line contains an integer $1\leq n\leq 10^5$, the number of experiments.  - The second line contains $n$ integers $b_1,\dots ,b_ n$, where $0\leq b_ i\leq 2^{60}$ is the number of bacteria used in the $i$th experiment. -----Output----- Output a single line containing the number of bacteria that remains after doing all the experiments, or “error”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 0 0 0 Sample Output 1: 8 Sample Input 2: 5 1 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 2: 1 Sample Input 3: 5 0 2 2 4 0 Sample Output 3: 0
