 Your task is to write a program which for a given state of Rubik's cube tells if it's possible to solve it using 90-degrees rotation of one face in any direction. Cube is called solved if for each face of cube all squares on it has the same color. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube 
-----Input----- In first line given a sequence of 24 integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 6), where a_{i} denotes color of i-th square. There are exactly 4 occurrences of all colors in this sequence. -----Output----- Print «YES» (without quotes) if it's possible to solve cube using one rotation and «NO» (without quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 2 5 4 6 1 3 6 2 5 5 1 2 3 5 3 1 1 2 4 6 6 4 3 4 Output NO Input 5 3 5 3 2 5 2 5 6 2 6 2 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 6 3 6 3 Output YES -----Note----- In first test case cube looks like this: [Image]  In second test case cube looks like this:  [Image]  It's possible to solve cube by rotating face with squares with numbers 13, 14, 15, 16.
