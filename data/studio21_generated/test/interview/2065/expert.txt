 You are given a list of n men. For each man, you are asked to output the man's number, the man's number's father, and the man's number's ancestor. 
-----Input----- In the first line of the input two integers n and m (0 ≤ m < n ≤ 100 000) are given — the number of the men in the Sasha's family and the number of family relations in it respectively. The next m lines describe family relations: the (i + 1)^{th} line consists of pair of integers p_{i} and q_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i}, q_{i} ≤ n, p_{i} ≠ q_{i}) meaning that the man numbered p_{i} is the father of the man numbered q_{i}. It is guaranteed that every pair of numbers appears at most once, that among every pair of two different men at least one of them is not an ancestor of another and that every man has at most one father. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n), i^{th} of which means that the man numbered i wants to give a gift to the man numbered a_{i}. It is guaranteed that for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n the man numbered a_{i} is an ancestor of the man numbered i. -----Output----- Print an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of the men in the list of candidates, in the first line. Print then k pairwise different positive integers not exceeding n — the numbers of the men in the list in an order satisfying every of the men's wishes, one per line. If there are more than one appropriate lists, print any of them. If there is no appropriate list print  - 1 in the only line. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 1 Output -1 Input 4 2 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 3 Output 3 2 1 3 -----Note----- The first sample explanation:   if there would be no 1 in the list then the first and the third man's wishes would not be satisfied (a_1 = a_3 = 1);  if there would be no 2 in the list then the second man wish would not be satisfied (a_2 = 2);  if 1 would stay before 2 in the answer then the second man would have to give his gift to the first man, but he wants to give it to himself (a_2 = 2).  if, at the other hand, the man numbered 2 would stay before the man numbered 1, then the third man would have to give his gift to the second man, but not to the first (a_3 = 1).
