 You are given an array of integers. Make sets of 2 integers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 1\,000$) — the number of students in the building and the number of different drinks. The next $n$ lines contain student's favorite drinks. The $i$-th line contains a single integer from $1$ to $k$ — the type of the favorite drink of the $i$-th student. -----Output----- Print exactly one integer — the maximum number of students that can get a favorite drink. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 1 3 1 1 2 Output 4 Input 10 3 2 1 3 2 3 3 1 3 1 2 Output 9 -----Note----- In the first example, students could choose three sets with drinks $1$, $1$ and $2$ (so they will have two sets with two drinks of the type $1$ each and one set with two drinks of the type $2$, so portions will be $1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2$). This way all students except the second one will get their favorite drinks. Another possible answer is sets with drinks $1$, $2$ and $3$. In this case the portions will be $1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3$. Then all the students except one will gain their favorite drinks. The only student that will not gain the favorite drink will be a student with $a_i = 1$ (i.e. the first, the third or the fourth).
