 You are given two integers x and y. Find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l   a, b   r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a   b. 
-----Input----- The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 1 2 Output 2 Input 1 12 1 12 Output 4 Input 50 100 3 30 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1). In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3). In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
