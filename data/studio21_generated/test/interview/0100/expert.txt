 You are given an array of integers. You need to find all arrays of size 1 to 10, such that there is no "dead" pixels. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white. -----Output----- Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them. If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1. -----Examples----- Input 4 8 ..w..w.. ........ ........ ..w..w.. Output ..w++w.. ..+..+.. ..+..+.. ..w++w.. Input 5 6 ...... .w.... ...... ..w... ...... Output ...... +w+... +.+... ++w... ...... Input 2 4 .... .w.. Output .... .w.. Input 2 6 w..w.w ...w.. Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
