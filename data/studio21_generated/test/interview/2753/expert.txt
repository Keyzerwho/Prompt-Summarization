 You are given two arrays. Find the first minute of the day when both stars will flash at the same minute for the first time. 
-----Input----- Four lines containing four timestamps in $HH$:$MM$ format (hours:minutes), with $00 \le HH \le 23$, $00 \le MM \le 59$. The timestamps are, in order: the time of the first star’s flash, the time of the second star’s flash, the time between consecutive flashes of the first star, the time between consecutive flashes of the second star. The first two timestamps will differ, and both fall on the same day – Saturday. Flash intervals will not be 00:00. -----Output----- If the stars will never flash at the same minute, output “Never” in a single line. Otherwise, output in the first line the name of the weekday of the first same-minute flash. A reminder on the correct spelling of weekdays: “Sunday”, “Monday”, “Tuesday”, “Wednesday”, “Thursday”, “Friday” and “Saturday”. In the second line, output the timestamp of the first same-minute flash, in $HH$:$MM$ format (with a leading zero for $HH$ and $MM$ if they are less than $10$). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 02:20 13:00 05:50 01:00 Sample Output 1: Saturday 14:00 Sample Input 2: 02:20 23:28 00:40 23:50 Sample Output 2: Never
