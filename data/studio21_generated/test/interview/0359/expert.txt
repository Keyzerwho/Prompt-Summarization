 You are given a rectangle with side h and w and a list of photos. You need to find the minimum value of x which can be obtained after putting photos, or report that there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy all the constraints. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers a, h and w (1 ≤ a, h, w ≤ 10^9) — the size of photos and the height and the width of the wall. -----Output----- Print one non-negative real number — the minimum value of x which can be obtained after putting the photos on the wall. The absolute or the relative error of the answer must not exceed 10^{ - 6}. Print -1 if there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy the constraints. -----Examples----- Input 2 18 13 Output 0.5 Input 4 4 4 Output 0 Input 3 4 3 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example Arkadiy can put 7 rows of photos with 5 photos in each row, so the minimum value of x equals to 0.5. In the second example Arkadiy can put only 1 photo which will take the whole wall, so the minimum value of x equals to 0. In the third example there is no way to put positive number of photos and satisfy the constraints described in the statement, so the answer is -1.
