 You are given a list of integers. Find the position of first number after given number. 
-----Input----- The only line of input contains integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^12). Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Output----- Print the number that will stand at the position number k after Volodya's manipulations. -----Examples----- Input 10 3 Output 5 Input 7 7 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first sample Volodya's sequence will look like this: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. The third place in the sequence is therefore occupied by the number 5.
