 Caisa is going to the supermarket and he wants to buy only one type of sugar. For each seller, he wants to know the number of sweets he should get as change. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n, s (1 ≤ n, s ≤ 100). The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 100; 0 ≤ y_{i} < 100), where x_{i} represents the number of dollars and y_{i} the number of cents needed in order to buy the i-th type of sugar. -----Output----- Print a single integer representing the maximum number of sweets he can buy, or -1 if he can't buy any type of sugar. -----Examples----- Input 5 10 3 90 12 0 9 70 5 50 7 0 Output 50 Input 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first test sample Caisa can buy the fourth type of sugar, in such a case he will take 50 sweets as a change.
