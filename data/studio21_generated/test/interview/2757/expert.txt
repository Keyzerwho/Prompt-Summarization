 Given an $n$-variable boolean function specified by a list of the $2^n$ different values the function should take for various inputs. Compute the number of vertices in the minimal BDD representing this function. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer $1 \leq n \leq 18$. Then one more line follows that contains $2^n$ values (either $0$ or $1$) describing an $n$-variable boolean function. We think of these values as being indexed from $0$ to $2^n-1$. The $i$th such value represents $f(x_0, \ldots , x_{n-1})$ where $x_ j$ is the $j$th least-significant bit of the binary representation of $i$. In other words, $x_ j$ is the coefficient of $2^j$ in the binary expansion of $i$. The third sample input below corresponds to the BDD depicted above. -----Output----- Output consists of a single integer $m$ that is the number of vertices in the unique minimal BDD representing the boolean function from the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 1 0 1 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 2 0 0 0 0 Sample Output 2: 1
