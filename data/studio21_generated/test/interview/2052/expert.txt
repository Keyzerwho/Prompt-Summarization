 You are given frogs and stones. You need to output the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $w$ and $l$ ($1 \le l < w \le 10^5$) — the width of the river and the maximum length of a frog's jump. The second line contains $w - 1$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{w-1}$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^4$), where $a_i$ is the number of stones at the distance $i$ from the bank the frogs are currently at. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of frogs that can cross the river. -----Examples----- Input 10 5 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 0 Output 3 Input 10 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample two frogs can use the different stones at the distance $5$, and one frog can use the stones at the distances $3$ and then $8$. In the second sample although there are two stones at the distance $5$, that does not help. The three paths are: $0 \to 3 \to 6 \to 9 \to 10$, $0 \to 2 \to 5 \to 8 \to 10$, $0 \to 1 \to 4 \to 7 \to 10$.
