 You are given $n$ cubes. You need to place these cubes in such a way that they would be sorted in a non-decreasing order by their volume. 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one positive integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$) — number of cubes. The second line contains $n$ positive integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — volumes of cubes. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a word in a single line: "YES" (without quotation marks) if the cubes can be sorted and "NO" (without quotation marks) otherwise. -----Example----- Input 3 5 5 3 2 1 4 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 Output YES YES NO -----Note----- In the first test case it is possible to sort all the cubes in $7$ exchanges. In the second test case the cubes are already sorted. In the third test case we can make $0$ exchanges, but the cubes are not sorted yet, so the answer is "NO".
