 you are given n cities, m bidirectional roads, and k storages. You need to find k cities where Masha can open her bakery. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of cities in country Masha lives in, the number of roads between them and the number of flour storages respectively. Then m lines follow. Each of them contains three integers u, v and l (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, u ≠ v) meaning that there is a road between cities u and v of length of l kilometers . If k > 0, then the last line of the input contains k distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n) — the number of cities having flour storage located in. If k = 0 then this line is not presented in the input. -----Output----- Print the minimum possible amount of rubles Masha should pay for flour delivery in the only line. If the bakery can not be opened (while satisfying conditions) in any of the n cities, print  - 1 in the only line. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 2 1 2 5 1 2 3 2 3 4 1 4 10 1 5 Output 3 Input 3 1 1 1 2 3 3 Output -1 -----Note----- [Image] Image illustrates the first sample case. Cities with storage located in and the road representing the answer are darkened.
