 You are given 4 special boxes of candies. However, something bad has happened! Some of the boxes could have been lost and now there are only n (0   n   4) boxes remaining. The i-th remaining box contains a_{i} candies. Now Jeff wants to know: is there a possible way to find the number of candies of the 4 - n missing boxes, meeting the condition above (the mean, median and range are equal) 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an only integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 4). The next n lines contain integers a_{i}, denoting the number of candies in the i-th box (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 500). -----Output----- In the first output line, print "YES" if a solution exists, or print "NO" if there is no solution. If a solution exists, you should output 4 - n more lines, each line containing an integer b, denoting the number of candies in a missing box. All your numbers b must satisfy inequality 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that if there exists a positive integer solution, you can always find such b's meeting the condition. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them. Given numbers a_{i} may follow in any order in the input, not necessary in non-decreasing. a_{i} may have stood at any positions in the original set, not necessary on lowest n first positions. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 1 Output YES 3 3 Input 3 1 1 1 Output NO Input 4 1 2 2 3 Output YES -----Note----- For the first sample, the numbers of candies in 4 boxes can be 1, 1, 3, 3. The arithmetic mean, the median and the range of them are all 2. For the second sample, it's impossible to find the missing number of candies. In the third example no box has been lost and numbers satisfy the condition. You may output b in any order.
