 You are given a sequence of positive integers. You need to find initial sequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) — the size of the set S. The second line contains m integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the elements of the set S. It's guaranteed that the elements of the set are given in strictly increasing order, that means s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m}. -----Output----- If there is no solution, print a single line containing -1. Otherwise, in the first line print a single integer n denoting the length of the sequence, n should not exceed 4000. In the second line print n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the sequence. We can show that if a solution exists, then there is a solution with n not exceeding 4000 and a_{i} not exceeding 10^6. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 4 6 12 Output 3 4 6 12 Input 2 2 3 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example 2 = gcd(4, 6), the other elements from the set appear in the sequence, and we can show that there are no values different from 2, 4, 6 and 12 among gcd(a_{i}, a_{i} + 1, ..., a_{j}) for every 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n.
