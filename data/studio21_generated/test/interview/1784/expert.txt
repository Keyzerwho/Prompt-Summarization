 You are given a number of pebbles q and a number of colors k. You need to paint all pebbles using k. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100), separated by a space — the number of piles and the number of colors respectively. The second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles. -----Output----- If there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output "NO" (without quotes) . Otherwise in the first line output "YES" (without quotes). Then n lines should follow, the i-th of them should contain a_{i} space-separated integers. j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ a_{i}) of these integers should be equal to the color of the j-th pebble in the i-th pile. If there are several possible answers, you may output any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 4 1 2 3 4 Output YES 1 1 4 1 2 4 1 2 3 4 Input 5 2 3 2 4 1 3 Output NO Input 5 4 3 2 4 3 5 Output YES 1 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 4 1 3 4 1 1 2 3 4
