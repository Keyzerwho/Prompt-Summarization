-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). Each of the next n lines contains a character '+' or '-', and an integer d_{i}, separated by a space (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 10^9). Record "+ d_{i}" in i-th line means that a carrier with d_{i} ice cream packs occupies i-th place from the start of the queue, and record "- d_{i}" means that a child who wants to take d_{i} packs stands in i-th place. -----Output----- Print two space-separated integers — number of ice cream packs left after all operations, and number of kids that left the house in distress. -----Examples----- Input 5 7 + 5 - 10 - 20 + 40 - 20 Output 22 1 Input 5 17 - 16 - 2 - 98 + 100 - 98 Output 3 2 -----Note----- Consider the first sample.  Initially Kay and Gerda have 7 packs of ice cream.  Carrier brings 5 more, so now they have 12 packs.  A kid asks for 10 packs and receives them. There are only 2 packs remaining.  Another kid asks for 20 packs. Kay and Gerda do not have them, so the kid goes away distressed.  Carrier bring 40 packs, now Kay and Gerda have 42 packs.  Kid asks for 20 packs and receives them. There are 22 packs remaining.
