 Given an array of integers s, t and x, return the minimum distance that needs to be traveled along road to visit one shrine and one temple. s,t,x are all different integers. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: A B Q s_1 : s_A t_1 : t_B x_1 : x_Q -----Output----- Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query. -----Sample Input----- 2 3 4 100 600 400 900 1000 150 2000 899 799 -----Sample Output----- 350 1400 301 399 There are two shrines and three temples. The shrines are located at distances of 100, 600 meters from the west end of the road, and the temples are located at distances of 400, 900, 1000 meters from the west end of the road.  - Query 1: If we start from a point at a distance of 150 meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk 50 meters west to visit a shrine, then to walk 300 meters east to visit a temple.  - Query 2: If we start from a point at a distance of 2000 meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk 1000 meters west to visit a temple, then to walk 400 meters west to visit a shrine. We will pass by another temple on the way, but it is fine.  - Query 3: If we start from a point at a distance of 899 meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk 1 meter east to visit a temple, then to walk 300 meters west to visit a shrine.  - Query 4: If we start from a point at a distance of 799 meters from the west end of the road, the optimal move is first to walk 199 meters west to visit a shrine, then to walk 200 meters west to visit a temple.
