 You are given a sequence of length N. You need to make all the elements in this sequence equal by repeating the operation above some number of times. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N K A_1 A_2 ... A_N -----Output----- Print the minimum number of operations required. -----Sample Input----- 4 3 2 3 1 4 -----Sample Output----- 2 One optimal strategy is as follows:  - In the first operation, choose the first, second and third elements. The sequence A becomes 1, 1, 1, 4.  - In the second operation, choose the second, third and fourth elements. The sequence A becomes 1, 1, 1, 1.
