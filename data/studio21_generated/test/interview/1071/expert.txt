 You are given medals and cups. You need to output the shelves where medals and cups can be put. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integers a_1, a_2 and a_3 (0 ≤ a_1, a_2, a_3 ≤ 100). The second line contains integers b_1, b_2 and b_3 (0 ≤ b_1, b_2, b_3 ≤ 100). The third line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- Print "YES" (without the quotes) if all the rewards can be put on the shelves in the described manner. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 Output YES Input 1 1 3 2 3 4 2 Output YES Input 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 Output NO
