 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input----- The input file contains the single positive integer $D\leq 200000$, the distance to be measured. -----Output----- Output two non-negative integers $n_1$ and $n_2$, the numbers of the frames that Susan should compare. They should fulfill $n_2^2-n_1^2=D$. If no two such integers exist, instead output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 88 Sample Output: 9 13
