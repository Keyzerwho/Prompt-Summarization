 You are given an array of integers. You need to find 4 different integers such that sum of their squares is maximum possible.  
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000). It is guaranteed that grid contains at least 4 different points. -----Output----- Print 4 lines with two integers per line separated by space — coordinates of points p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 in order which represent the longest possible polyline. Judge program compares your answer and jury's answer with 10^{ - 6} precision. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 Input 0 10 Output 0 1 0 10 0 0 0 9
