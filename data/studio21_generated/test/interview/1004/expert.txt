 You are given an array of integers $a$ in the order they occurred.  The array $a$ represents one or more consecutive days.  The administrator erased the dates of events by mistake, but he didn't change the order of the events.  You must partition (cut) the array $a$ into contiguous subarrays, which must represent non-empty valid days (or say that it's impossible). Each array element should belong to exactly one contiguous subarray of a partition. Each contiguous subarray of a partition should be a valid day. For example, if $n=8$ and $a=[1, -1, 1, 2, -1, -2, 3, -3]$ then he can partition it into two contiguous subarrays which are valid days: $a = [1, -1~ \boldsymbol{|}~ 1, 2, -1, -2, 3, -3]$. Help the administrator to partition the given array $a$ in the required way or report that it is impossible to do. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$). The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6$ and $a_i \neq 0$). -----Output----- If there is no valid partition, print $-1$. Otherwise, print any valid partition in the following format:   On the first line print the number $d$ of days ($1 \le d \le n$).  On the second line, print $d$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_d$ ($1 \le c_i \le n$ and $c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_d = n$), where $c_i$ is the number of events in the $i$-th day.  If there are many valid solutions, you can print any of them. You don't have to minimize nor maximize the number of days. -----Examples----- Input 6 1 7 -7 3 -1 -3 Output 1 6 Input 8 1 -1 1 2 -1 -2 3 -3 Output 2 2 6 Input 6 2 5 -5 5 -5 -2 Output -1 Input 3 -8 1 1 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example, the whole array is a valid day. In the second example, one possible valid solution is to split the array into $[1, -1]$ and $[1, 2, -1, -2, 3, -3]$ ($d = 2$ and $c = [2, 6]$). The only other valid solution would be to split the array into $[1, -1]$, $[1, 2, -1, -2]$ and $[3, -3]$ ($d = 3$ and $c = [2, 4, 2]$). Both solutions are accepted. In the third and fourth examples, we can prove that there exists no valid solution. Please note that the array given in input is not guaranteed to represent a coherent set of events.
