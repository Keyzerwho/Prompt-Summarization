 You are given a list of events in chronological order. Each event comes with a number. The first event comes with a number 1. There are following types of events:   Polycarp changes the speed of his car to specified (this event comes with a positive integer number);  Polycarp's car overtakes the other car;  Polycarp's car goes past the "speed limit" sign (this sign comes with a positive integer);  Polycarp's car goes past the "overtake is allowed" sign;  Polycarp's car goes past the "no speed limit";  Polycarp's car goes past the "no overtake allowed";  It is guaranteed that the first event in chronological order is the event of type 1 (Polycarp changed the speed of his car to specified). After the exam Polycarp can justify his rule violations by telling the driving instructor that he just didn't notice some of the signs. What is the minimal number of signs Polycarp should say he didn't notice, so that he would make no rule violations from his point of view 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — number of events. Each of the next n lines starts with integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 6) — the type of the event. An integer s (1 ≤ s ≤ 300) follows in the query of the first and the third type (if it is the query of first type, then it's new speed of Polycarp's car, if it is the query of third type, then it's new speed limit). It is guaranteed that the first event in chronological order is the event of type 1 (Polycarp changed the speed of his car to specified). -----Output----- Print the minimal number of road signs Polycarp should say he didn't notice, so that he would make no rule violations from his point of view. -----Examples----- Input 11 1 100 3 70 4 2 3 120 5 3 120 6 1 150 4 3 300 Output 2 Input 5 1 100 3 200 2 4 5 Output 0 Input 7 1 20 2 6 4 6 6 2 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example Polycarp should say he didn't notice the "speed limit" sign with the limit of 70 and the second "speed limit" sign with the limit of 120. In the second example Polycarp didn't make any rule violation. In the third example Polycarp should say he didn't notice both "no overtake allowed" that came after "overtake is allowed" sign.
