 You are given a collection of rods of integer lengths. You need to bring these rods together to make a convex polygon with a nonzero area. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — a number of rod-blanks. The second line contains n integers l_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ 10^9) — lengths of rods, which Cicasso already has. It is guaranteed that it is impossible to make a polygon with n vertices and nonzero area using the rods Cicasso already has. -----Output----- Print the only integer z — the minimum length of the rod, so that after adding it it can be possible to construct convex polygon with (n + 1) vertices and nonzero area from all of the rods. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 1 Output 1 Input 5 20 4 3 2 1 Output 11 -----Note----- In the first example triangle with sides {1 + 1 = 2, 2, 1} can be formed from a set of lengths {1, 1, 1, 2}.  In the second example you can make a triangle with lengths {20, 11, 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10}.
