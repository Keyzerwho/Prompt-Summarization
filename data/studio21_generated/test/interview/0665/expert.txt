 Vasya is reciting a verse. Each part takes $a_i$ seconds to recite. Santa has $s$ seconds to listen to Vasya. Vasya can skip at most one part of the verse while reciting it. Determine which part Vasya needs to skip to obtain the maximum possible number of gifts. If Vasya shouldn't skip anything, print 0. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. You have to process $t$ test cases.
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5, 1 \le s \le 10^9$) — the number of parts in the verse and the maximum number of seconds Santa will listen to Vasya, respectively. The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the time it takes to recite each part of the verse. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case print one integer — the number of the part that Vasya needs to skip to obtain the maximum number of gifts. If Vasya shouldn't skip any parts, print 0. -----Example----- Input 3 7 11 2 9 1 3 18 1 4 4 35 11 9 10 7 1 8 5 Output 2 1 0 -----Note----- In the first test case if Vasya skips the second part then he gets three gifts. In the second test case no matter what part of the verse Vasya skips. In the third test case Vasya can recite the whole verse.
