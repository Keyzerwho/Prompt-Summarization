 You are at left stairs of building. You need to turn off lights in minimum number of minutes. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 15 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 100) — the number of floors and the number of rooms in each floor, respectively. The next n lines contains the building description. Each line contains a binary string of length m + 2 representing a floor (the left stairs, then m rooms, then the right stairs) where 0 indicates that the light is off and 1 indicates that the light is on. The floors are listed from top to bottom, so that the last line represents the ground floor. The first and last characters of each string represent the left and the right stairs, respectively, so they are always 0. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum total time needed to turn off all the lights. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 0010 0100 Output 5 Input 3 4 001000 000010 000010 Output 12 Input 4 3 01110 01110 01110 01110 Output 18 -----Note----- In the first example, Sagheer will go to room 1 in the ground floor, then he will go to room 2 in the second floor using the left or right stairs. In the second example, he will go to the fourth room in the ground floor, use right stairs, go to the fourth room in the second floor, use right stairs again, then go to the second room in the last floor. In the third example, he will walk through the whole corridor alternating between the left and right stairs at each floor.
