 Given a string of characters, find minimum number of rotations of the wheel required to print it. 
-----Input----- The only line of input contains the name of some exhibit — the non-empty string consisting of no more than 100 characters. It's guaranteed that the string consists of only lowercase English letters. -----Output----- Print one integer — the minimum number of rotations of the wheel, required to print the name given in the input. -----Examples----- Input zeus Output 18 Input map Output 35 Input ares Output 34 -----Note-----   [Image]  To print the string from the first sample it would be optimal to perform the following sequence of rotations:   from 'a' to 'z' (1 rotation counterclockwise),  from 'z' to 'e' (5 clockwise rotations),  from 'e' to 'u' (10 rotations counterclockwise),  from 'u' to 's' (2 counterclockwise rotations).  In total, 1 + 5 + 10 + 2 = 18 rotations are required.
