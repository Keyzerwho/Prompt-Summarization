 You are given a list of errands. Each errand is a list of 2 integers: the street and the avenue. An errand is visited when the intersection of the street and the avenue is visited. You are asked to find the minimum number of errands you need to visit on your way to work. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains an integer $0\leq n\leq 10^5$, the number of errands you have to run that day.  - The next line contains four integers $0\leq x_ h, y_ h, x_ w, y_ w\leq 10^9$ corresponding to the locations of your house and workplace.  - The next $n$ lines each contain two integers $0\leq x_ i,y_ i\leq 10^9$, the coordinates of your $i$th errand. -----Output----- Output a single line, containing the number of errands you can run before work without taking a longer route than necessary. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 0 0 6 6 5 4 2 6 3 1 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 5 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 3 1 Sample Output 2: 3
