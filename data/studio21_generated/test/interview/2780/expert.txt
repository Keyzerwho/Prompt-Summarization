 You are given the number of students in the class, $N$, and the largest number they can write down, $M$. Determine the optimal randomized strategy (followed by all students). That is, determine the probability of selecting each number between $1$ and $M$. 
-----Input----- There is one line with two integers: $N$, which is the number of students in the class, and $M$, which is the largest integer each student can choose. -----Constraints----- $3$ $\leq $ $N$ $\leq $ $7$ Number of students in the class $1$ $\leq $ $M$ $\leq $ $N+1$ Maximum number that can be selected -----Output----- The output consists of $M$ lines. Line $k$ should have the probability of selecting number $k$. The result will be considered correct as long as the absolute error does not exceed $10^{-3}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 Sample Output 1: 0.46410 0.26795 0.26795 Sample Input 2: 7 1 Sample Output 2: 1.00000
