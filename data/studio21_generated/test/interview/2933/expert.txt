 You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the number of plates $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$). Each of the following $n$ lines contains one positive integer less than or equal to $1000$, denoting the weight of each plate. -----Output----- Output one integer, the combined weight closest to $1000$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 900 500 498 4 Sample Output: 1002
