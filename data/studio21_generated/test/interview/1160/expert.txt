 You are given an array $a$ of size $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action: Choose the leftmost maximum length subarray consisting only of zeros; Let this segment be $[l; r]$.  If $r-l+1$ is odd then assign $a[\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ otherwise assign $a[\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$.  


-----Input----- The first line of the input contains six non-negative integers — the number of t-shirts of each size. The numbers are given for the sizes S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL, respectively. The total number of t-shirts doesn't exceed 100 000. The second line contains positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of participants. The following n lines contain the sizes specified by the participants, one line per participant. The i-th line contains information provided by the i-th participant: single size or two sizes separated by comma (without any spaces). If there are two sizes, the sizes are written in increasing order. It is guaranteed that two sizes separated by comma are neighboring. -----Output----- If it is not possible to present a t-shirt to each participant, print «NO» (without quotes). Otherwise, print n + 1 lines. In the first line print «YES» (without quotes). In the following n lines print the t-shirt sizes the orginizers should give to participants, one per line. The order of the participants should be the same as in the input. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 0 1 0 1 1 0 3 XL S,M XL,XXL Output YES XL M XXL Input 1 1 2 0 1 1 5 S M S,M XXL,XXXL XL,XXL Output NO
