 Given a list of n phone numbers, find the minimum length sequence of digits such that if Polycarp enters this sequence, Berdroid shows this only phone number.
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 70000) — the total number of phone contacts in Polycarp's contacts. The phone numbers follow, one in each line. Each number is a positive 9-digit integer starting with a digit from 1 to 9. All the numbers are distinct. -----Output----- Print exactly n lines: the i-th of them should contain the shortest non-empty sequence of digits, such that if Polycarp enters it, the Berdroid OS shows up only the i-th number from the contacts. If there are several such sequences, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 123456789 100000000 100123456 Output 9 000 01 Input 4 123456789 193456789 134567819 934567891 Output 2 193 81 91
