 You are given coordinates (0,x). Determine, what is the minimum number of steps (in steps) the elephant needs to make in order to get to his friend's house. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1 000 000) — The coordinate of the friend's house. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to get from point 0 to point x. -----Examples----- Input 5 Output 1 Input 12 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample the elephant needs to make one step of length 5 to reach the point x. In the second sample the elephant can get to point x if he moves by 3, 5 and 4. There are other ways to get the optimal answer but the elephant cannot reach x in less than three moves.
