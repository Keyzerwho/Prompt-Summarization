 You are given a number N and a number K. You need to output the maximum profit Simone can make by carefully choosing when to borrow and repay the $100$ CryptoKattis. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $1 \le N \le 100000$ and $1 \le K \le 100$. $N$ is the number of days you know the CryptoKattis price of, and $K$ is the cost in dollars of borrowing CryptoKattis per day. The next line contains $N$ integers separated by spaces. These are the CryptoKattis prices during the $N$ days. Each CryptoKattis price is between $1$ and $100000$ dollars. -----Output----- Output a single decimal number; the maximum profit you can make performing a short sell. If you cannot make a profit no matter what short sell you make, output $0$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 10 1000 980 960 940 10 Sample Output: 98950
