 You are given 2 integer arrays of length N, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N Z W a_1 a_2 ... a_N -----Output----- Print the score. -----Sample Input----- 3 100 100 10 1000 100 -----Sample Output----- 900 If X draws two cards first, Y will draw the last card, and the score will be |1000 - 100| = 900.
