 You are given $n$ and $m$ positive integers. You are also given a rectangular blanket made of $n \cdot m$ colored pieces. Your goal is to figure out the number of different subrectangles Innokenty can cut out and sell as a flag. Two subrectangles located in different places but forming the same flag are still considered different. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 1\,000$) — the number of rows and the number of columns on the blanket. Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' and describes a row of the blanket. Equal letters correspond to equal colors, different letters correspond to different colors. -----Output----- In the only line print the number of subrectangles which form valid flags. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 aaa bbb ccb ddd Output 6 Input 6 1 a a b b c c Output 1 -----Note----- [Image] [Image] The selected subrectangles are flags in the first example.
