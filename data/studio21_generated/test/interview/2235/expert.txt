 You are given trips made by a passenger. For each trip, you are given a start time, end time, and number of minutes the trip takes. You need to output the total sum charged after each trip. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of trips made by passenger. Each of the following n lines contains the time of trip t_{i} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^9), measured in minutes from the time of starting the system. All t_{i} are different, given in ascending order, i. e. t_{i} + 1 > t_{i} holds for all 1 ≤ i < n. -----Output----- Output n integers. For each trip, print the sum the passenger is charged after it. -----Examples----- Input 3 10 20 30 Output 20 20 10 Input 10 13 45 46 60 103 115 126 150 256 516 Output 20 20 10 0 20 0 0 20 20 10 -----Note----- In the first example, the system works as follows: for the first and second trips it is cheaper to pay for two one-trip tickets, so each time 20 rubles is charged, after the third trip the system understands that it would be cheaper to buy a ticket for 90 minutes. This ticket costs 50 rubles, and the passenger had already paid 40 rubles, so it is necessary to charge 10 rubles only.
