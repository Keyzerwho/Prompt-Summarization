 You are given N bombs, numbered 1 to N, planted in our country. Bomb i is planted at the coordinate A_i. It is currently activated if B_i=1, and deactivated if B_i=0. The device has M cords numbered 1 to M. If we cut Cord j, the states of all the bombs planted between the coordinates L_j and R_j (inclusive) will be switched - from activated to deactivated, and vice versa. Determine whether it is possible to deactivate all the bombs at the same time. If the answer is yes, output a set of cords that should be cut. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M A_1 B_1 : A_N B_N L_1 R_1 : L_M R_M -----Output----- If it is impossible to deactivate all the bombs at the same time, print -1. If it is possible to do so, print a set of cords that should be cut, as follows: k c_1 c_2 \dots c_k Here, k is the number of cords (possibly 0), and c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k represent the cords that should be cut. 1 \leq c_1 < c_2 < \dots < c_k \leq M must hold. -----Sample Input----- 3 4 5 1 10 1 8 0 1 10 4 5 6 7 8 9 -----Sample Output----- 2 1 4 There are two activated bombs at the coordinates 5, 10, and one deactivated bomb at the coordinate 8. Cutting Cord 1 switches the states of all the bombs planted between the coordinates 1 and 10, that is, all of the three bombs. Cutting Cord 4 switches the states of all the bombs planted between the coordinates 8 and 9, that is, Bomb 3. Thus, we can deactivate all the bombs by cutting Cord 1 and Cord 4.
