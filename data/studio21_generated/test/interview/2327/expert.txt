 You are given a sequence of consecutive integers from $0$ to $n$. The sequence is padded with leading zeros to the same length. Your task is to find the sum of differences of neighboring numbers. 
-----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$) — the number of test cases. The following $t$ lines contain a description of test cases. The first and only line in each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18})$. -----Output----- Output $t$ lines. For each test case, you should output a single line with one integer — the unfairness of the contest if the rating sequence equals to $0$, $1$, ..., $n - 1$, $n$. -----Example----- Input 5 5 7 11 1 2000000000000 Output 8 11 19 1 3999999999987 -----Note----- For $n = 5$ we calculate unfairness of the following sequence (numbers from $0$ to $5$ written in binary with extra leading zeroes, so they all have the same length):   $000$  $001$  $010$  $011$  $100$  $101$  The differences are equal to $1$, $2$, $1$, $3$, $1$ respectively, so unfairness is equal to $1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8$.
