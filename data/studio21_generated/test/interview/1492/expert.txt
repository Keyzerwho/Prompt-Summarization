 You are given a map $n \times m$ rectangle. You need to output the maximum possible value of $T$ and a possible set of trees that could be initially set on fire. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^6$, $1 \le n \cdot m \le 10^6$) — the sizes of the map. Next $n$ lines contain the map. The $i$-th line corresponds to the $i$-th row of the map and contains $m$-character string. The $j$-th character of the $i$-th string is "X" if the corresponding tree is burnt and "." otherwise. It's guaranteed that the map contains at least one "X". -----Output----- In the first line print the single integer $T$ — the maximum time the Forest was on fire. In the next $n$ lines print the certificate: the map ($n \times m$ rectangle) where the trees that were set on fire are marked as "X" and all other trees are marked as ".". -----Examples----- Input 3 6 XXXXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX Output 1 ...... .X.XX. ......
