 You have N non-negative integers: A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. Consider painting at least one and at most N-1 integers among them in red, and painting the rest in blue. Let the beauty of the painting be the XOR of the integers painted in red, plus the XOR of the integers painted in blue. Find the maximum possible beauty of the painting. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 A_2 ... A_N -----Output----- Print the maximum possible beauty of the painting. -----Sample Input----- 3 3 6 5 -----Sample Output----- 12 If we paint 3, 6, 5 in blue, red, blue, respectively, the beauty will be (6) + (3 \oplus 5) = 12. There is no way to paint the integers resulting in greater beauty than 12, so the answer is 12.
