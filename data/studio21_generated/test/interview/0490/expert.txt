 You are given $n$ different binary words. You want to order the words such that the first character of a word matches the last character of the previous word. If you cannot put the words in that order then you can reverse some words so that: the final set of $n$ words  still contains different words; there is a way to put all words in the order specified.

The circular pizza has to be sliced into $n + 1$ pieces. -----Output----- A single integer — the number of straight cuts Shiro needs. -----Examples----- Input 3 Output 2 Input 4 Output 5 -----Note----- To cut the round pizza into quarters one has to make two cuts through the center with angle $90^{\circ}$ between them. To cut the round pizza into five equal parts one has to make five cuts.
