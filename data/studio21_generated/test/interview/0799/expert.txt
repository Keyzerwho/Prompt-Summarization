 You are given n integers a_{i}. You need to find the minimum charges of the kingdom on the king's present. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of citizens in the kingdom. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the welfare of the i-th citizen. -----Output----- In the only line print the integer S — the minimum number of burles which are had to spend. -----Examples----- Input 5 0 1 2 3 4 Output 10 Input 5 1 1 0 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 1 3 1 Output 4 Input 1 12 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example if we add to the first citizen 4 burles, to the second 3, to the third 2 and to the fourth 1, then the welfare of all citizens will equal 4. In the second example it is enough to give one burle to the third citizen.  In the third example it is necessary to give two burles to the first and the third citizens to make the welfare of citizens equal 3. In the fourth example it is possible to give nothing to everyone because all citizens have 12 burles.
