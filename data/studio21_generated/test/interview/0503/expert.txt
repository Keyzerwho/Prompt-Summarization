 You are given an integer k and a sequence a, consisting of n integers. You are given an index i_1, i_2, i_3, such that 1   i_1 < i_2 < i_3   n. You are also given an integer m such that 1   m != i_1   i_2   i_3   n. You are asked to find the number of subsequences of length three that can be selected from the sequence a, so that they form a geometric progression with common ratio k. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2·10^5), showing how many numbers Polycarp's sequence has and his favorite number. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — elements of the sequence. -----Output----- Output a single number — the number of ways to choose a subsequence of length three, such that it forms a geometric progression with a common ratio k. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 1 1 2 2 4 Output 4 Input 3 1 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 10 3 1 2 6 2 3 6 9 18 3 9 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first sample test the answer is four, as any of the two 1s can be chosen as the first element, the second element can be any of the 2s, and the third element of the subsequence must be equal to 4.
