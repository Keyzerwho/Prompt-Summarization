 There has been yet another murder in the Shady city of Riverdale. This murder is being investigated by none other than the Riverdale's Finest- Jughead Jones & Betty Cooper. This murder has been done exactly in the same manner as all the murders happening since the return of the deadly game Gargoyle &Griffins. Betty has decided to put an end to these murders, so they decide to interrogate each and every person in the neighbourhood. As they don't know these people personally they want to first get to know about their character i.e whether a particular person is a Truth speaking person or a False speaking person. Jughead devises a strategy of interrogating the civilians. Jughead decides that they will collect statements from all the people in the neighbourhood about every other person living in the neighbourhood. Each person speaks a statement in form of an array consisting of T and F, which tells us what he thinks about the ith person. Let there be N people living in the neighbourhood. So if a person i is giving his/her statement, he/her will always call himself/herself a True person i.e Statement[i]=T. So Jughead says that they will select the maximum number of people that maybe speaking the truth such that their statements don't contradict and then interrogate them further about the murder. Help them pick the max no. of Truth speaking people. Note- A person speaking falsely doesn't mean that the complement of his statement would be the truth. If a person
-----Input:----- - First line will contain N$N$, the number of people in the neighbourhood. Then the Statements of ith$ith$ person follow.  - Each Statement contains a single line of input, an array of length N$N$ consisting of T$T$ and F$F$. -----Output:----- Print a single line denoting the maximum no. of people that might be speaking the truth. -----Constraints----- - 1≤N≤1000$1 \leq N \leq 1000$ - Statement$Statement$i$i$[i]=T$[i]=T$ -----Sample Input1:----- 5 T T F F F T T F F F T T T F F F F F T T F F F T T -----Sample Output1:----- 2 -----Sample Input2:----- 3 T T T T T T F F T -----Sample Output2:----- 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- In Sample 1 We can consider the 1st$1st$ and 2nd$2nd$ person to be speaking the truth. We can also consider the 4th$4th$ and the 5th$5th$ person to be speaking the truth.  Note$Note$: we cannot select 1st$1st$ 2nd$2nd$ and 3rd$3rd$ person because the 1st$1st$ and the second person have labelled the 3rd person as a false speaking person, therefore if we select all 3 contradiction will arise. In sample 2 Set contains only the 3rd person
