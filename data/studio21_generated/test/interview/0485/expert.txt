 Given some points on the plane, find the point which lies on the boundary of the square. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10$). Each of the following $4n + 1$ lines contains two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($0 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 50$), describing the coordinates of the next point. It is guaranteed that there are at least $n$ points on each side of the square and all $4n + 1$ points are distinct. -----Output----- Print two integers — the coordinates of the point that is not on the boundary of the square. -----Examples----- Input 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 2 1 2 2 Output 1 1 Input 2 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 2 2 0 2 1 2 2 Output 0 3 -----Note----- In both examples, the square has four sides $x=0$, $x=2$, $y=0$, $y=2$.
