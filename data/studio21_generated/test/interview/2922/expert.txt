 You are given the number of pieces of chocolate in each box. Write a program that finds how many pieces of chocolate John and Sam get, such that all boxes of chocolate are used. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), the number of boxes of chocolate Bob bought. The next line contains $n$ integers $a_ i$ representing the number of pieces of chocolate in the $i^{\text {th}}$ box ($1\le a_ i \le 100$). -----Output----- If it is possible for Bob to split the boxes such that John and Sam get the same number of pieces of chocolate, output YES. Otherwise, output NO. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 1 4 3 12 13 1 Sample Output: YES
