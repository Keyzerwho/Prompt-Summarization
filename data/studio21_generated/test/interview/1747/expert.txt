 You are given an array of integers. You need to find the longest k-good segment. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5) — the number of elements in a and the parameter k. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the elements of the array a. -----Output----- Print two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the index of the left and the index of the right ends of some k-good longest segment. If there are several longest segments you can print any of them. The elements in a are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 1 5 Input 9 3 6 5 1 2 3 2 1 4 5 Output 3 7 Input 3 1 1 2 3 Output 1 1
