 You are given two vectors $a$ and $b$. You need to find the smallest possible Euclidean distance between $a$ and $b$. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of the input contains the decimal number $0 \le W \le 1000$. The number contains at most $6$ digits after the decimal point. -----Output----- Output a single number – the minimal Euclidean distance between Agneta and Beata during their trip. Your answer will be accepted if it is within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-4}$ of the judges’ answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 0 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 6.283185 Sample Output 2: 1 Sample Input 3: 42 Sample Output 3: 1.5228490019
