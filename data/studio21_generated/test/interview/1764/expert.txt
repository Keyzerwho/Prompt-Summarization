 You are given a record and s,t are positive integers. You need to determine all the possible options 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n — the length of the sequence of games (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_{i}. If a_{i} = 1, then the i-th serve was won by Petya, if a_{i} = 2, then the i-th serve was won by Gena. It is not guaranteed that at least one option for numbers s and t corresponds to the given record. -----Output----- In the first line print a single number k — the number of options for numbers s and t. In each of the following k lines print two integers s_{i} and t_{i} — the option for numbers s and t. Print the options in the order of increasing s_{i}, and for equal s_{i} — in the order of increasing t_{i}. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 1 2 1 Output 2 1 3 3 1 Input 4 1 1 1 1 Output 3 1 4 2 2 4 1 Input 4 1 2 1 2 Output 0 Input 8 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 Output 3 1 6 2 3 6 1
