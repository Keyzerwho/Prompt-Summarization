 You are given an array with n integers. Each integer represents one of n socks. For each of m days, you have to follow mother's instruction and wear socks of the same color. There are k colors. For each of m days, you have k jars with paint. You need to paint socks in such a way that for each of m days you can follow the mother's instruction and wear socks of the same color. Return the number of socks that need their color to be changed in order to make it possible to follow mother's instruction and wear socks of the same color during each of m days. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 0 ≤ m ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 200 000) — the number of socks, the number of days and the number of available colors respectively. The second line contain n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ k) — current colors of Arseniy's socks. Each of the following m lines contains two integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i}, r_{i} ≤ n, l_{i} ≠ r_{i}) — indices of socks which Arseniy should wear during the i-th day. -----Output----- Print one integer — the minimum number of socks that should have their colors changed in order to be able to obey the instructions and not make people laugh from watching the socks of different colors. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 Output 2 Input 3 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample, Arseniy can repaint the first and the third socks to the second color. In the second sample, there is no need to change any colors.
