 You are given n numbers with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first input line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the number of hours on the train and the number of hours to read, correspondingly. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100), a_{i} is the light level at the i-th hour. -----Output----- In the first output line print the minimum light level Vasya will read at. In the second line print k distinct space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k}, — the indexes of hours Vasya will read at (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ n). The hours are indexed starting from 1. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. Print the numbers b_{i} in an arbitrary order. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 20 10 30 40 10 Output 20 1 3 4  Input 6 5 90 20 35 40 60 100 Output 35 1 3 4 5 6  -----Note----- In the first sample Vasya should read at the first hour (light 20), third hour (light 30) and at the fourth hour (light 40). The minimum light Vasya will have to read at is 20.
