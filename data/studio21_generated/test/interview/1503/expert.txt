 You are given N values. You need to delete some prefix and some suffix such that remaining common part is different. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $1 \le m \le 10$) — the number of suspects and the number of asked neighbors. Each of the next $m$ lines contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$). It is guaranteed that these integers form a correct permutation (that is, each number from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once). -----Output----- Output a single integer denoting the number of ways to delete some prefix and some suffix of each permutation (possibly empty), such that the remaining parts will be equal and non-empty. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 1 Output 4 Input 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1 4 5 3 4 5 1 2 3 5 4 2 1 2 3 5 4 1 1 2 3 4 5 Output 5 Input 2 2 1 2 2 1 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example, all possible common parts are $[1]$, $[2]$, $[3]$ and $[2, 3]$. In the second and third examples, you can only leave common parts of length $1$.
