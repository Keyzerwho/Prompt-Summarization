 # Task  Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform. # 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains three integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 30$), $m$ ($1 \le m \le 30$), and $e$ ($1 \le e \le \min (n, m)$). $e$ specifies the creeper’s explosion “radius” - the creeper will explode if both the horizontal and the vertical distance between player and creeper is less than or equal to $e$. The following $n$ lines consist of $m$ characters each and describe the dungeon map using the following characters  - P - the start position of the player  - C - the start position of the creeper  - E - the position of the exit  - X - an obstacle  - . - an empty square that can be entered by both creeper and player There is exactly one of ‘E’, ‘P’, and ‘C‘ each in the input. -----Output----- If it is possible to complete the mission and reach the exit without being blown up by the creeper, output the minimum number of moves necessary to escape. A move consists of either the player or the creeper moving, or both. If it is not possible to escape, print “you're toast”! -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 20 20 3 .................... ...X................ .X.X....X.....X..... .X.X....X....XX..... .X.X..........X..... .X.X....XXXXXXXXXXX. .XXXXXXX............ .X.................. .X...XXXXX.XXXX.XX.. .X..P............C.. .X.XX.X.XX.XXX..XX.. .X.X................ .X.XXXX....X........ .X.X.......X........ .X.X.......X........ .X.X........X....... .X.X...X....XX...... .X.X...X.....XX..... .X.X...X......XX.... .......X...........E Sample Output 1: 119 Sample Input 2: 5 5 1 E...C .....
