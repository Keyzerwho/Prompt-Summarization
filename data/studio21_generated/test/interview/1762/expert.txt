  
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 5·10^5) — the number of videos and servers, respectively. Next n lines contain the descriptions of the videos as pairs of integers s_{i}, m_{i} (1 ≤ s_{i}, m_{i} ≤ 10^9), where s_{i} is the time in seconds when the i-th video appeared and m_{i} is its duration in minutes. It is guaranteed that all the s_{i}'s are distinct and the videos are given in the chronological order of upload, that is in the order of increasing s_{i}. -----Output----- Print n numbers e_1, e_2, ..., e_{n}, where e_{i} is the time in seconds after the servers start working, when the i-th video will be recompressed. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 5 2 5 3 5 Output 6 7 11 Input 6 1 1 1000000000 2 1000000000 3 1000000000 4 1000000000 5 1000000000 6 3 Output 1000000001 2000000001 3000000001 4000000001 5000000001 5000000004
