 You are given an array of integers, where each integer is the number of a desk. The array is sorted in ascending order. You are also given an array, where each integer is the number of a desk. The array is sorted in descending order. Find the number of possible seating arrangements. 
-----Input----- Input will begin with a line containing N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000), the number of engineers.  N lines follow, each containing exactly two integers. The i-th line contains the number of the current desk of the i-th engineer and the number of the desk the i-th engineer wants to move to. Desks are numbered from 1 to 2·N. It is guaranteed that no two engineers sit at the same desk. -----Output----- Print the number of possible assignments, modulo 1000000007 = 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 5 5 2 3 7 7 3 Output 6 Input 5 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 5 Output 5 -----Note----- These are the possible assignments for the first example:   1 5 3 7  1 2 3 7  5 2 3 7  1 5 7 3  1 2 7 3  5 2 7 3
