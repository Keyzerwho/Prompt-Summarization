 There is a cave consisting of N rooms and M passages. Takahashi is in a room numbered 1. Room N has the exit. Each room is connected to every other room via a passage. Takahashi wants to go to Room 0. Takahashi can choose a passage randomly and take that passage. Aoki can block some passages. Aoki wants to minimize the number of passages that Takahashi takes. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M s_1 t_1 : s_M t_M -----Output----- Print the value of E when Aoki makes a choice that minimizes E. Your output will be judged as correct when the absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-6}. -----Sample Input----- 4 6 1 4 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 4 2 4 -----Sample Output----- 1.5000000000 If Aoki blocks the passage from Room 1 to Room 2, Takahashi will go along the path 1 → 3 → 4 with probability \frac{1}{2} and 1 → 4 with probability \frac{1}{2}. E = 1.5 here, and this is the minimum possible value of E.
