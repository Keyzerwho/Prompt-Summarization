 Given n integers, find the number (say $k$) of possible ways to choose two gifts so that no gift hangs both on the gift chosen by Chloe and on the gift chosen by Vladik. If it is impossible for them to choose the gifts without fighting, print Impossible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of gifts. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the pleasantness of the gifts. The next (n - 1) lines contain two numbers each. The i-th of these lines contains integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n, u_{i} ≠ v_{i}) — the description of the tree's edges. It means that gifts with numbers u_{i} and v_{i} are connected to each other with a rope. The gifts' ids in the description of the ropes can be given in arbirtary order: v_{i} hangs on u_{i} or u_{i} hangs on v_{i}.  It is guaranteed that all the gifts hang on the first gift, possibly with a sequence of ropes and another gifts. -----Output----- If it is possible for Chloe and Vladik to choose prizes without fighting, print single integer — the maximum possible sum of pleasantness they can get together. Otherwise print Impossible. -----Examples----- Input 8 0 5 -1 4 3 2 6 5 1 2 2 4 2 5 1 3 3 6 6 7 6 8 Output 25 Input 4 1 -5 1 1 1 2 1 4 2 3 Output 2 Input 1 -1 Output Impossible
