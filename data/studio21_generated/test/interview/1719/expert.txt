 You are given an integer N. Find the number of strings of length N that satisfy the following conditions, modulo 10^9+7:  - The string does not contain characters other than A, C, G and T.  - The string does not contain AGC as a substring.  - The condition above cannot be violated by swapping two adjacent characters once. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N -----Output----- Print the number of strings of length N that satisfy the following conditions, modulo 10^9+7. -----Sample Input----- 3 -----Sample Output----- 61 There are 4^3 = 64 strings of length 3 that do not contain characters other than A, C, G and T. Among them, only AGC, ACG and GAC violate the condition, so the answer is 64 - 3 = 61.
