 You are given a sequence of integers $A, B, C, D, ..., Z$. Each number in the sequence is divisible by a prime number $X$. Your goal is to obtain the maximum possible score. First, for each number in the sequence, you divide it by $X$. Then you erase the number and write it in its place. Finally, you erase the number and write it in its place. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer $N$, ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), the number of elements in the starting sequence. The second line of input contains $N$ positive integers smaller than or equal to $1000000$, the sequence Katica gave to Mirko. -----Output----- The one and only line of output should contain two integers. The first integer is the maximal possible score Mirko can obtain. The second integer is the smallest number of operations Mirko needs to perform to obtain it. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 4 4 1 Sample Output 1: 2 1 Sample Input 2: 3 8 24 9 Sample Output 2: 12 3
