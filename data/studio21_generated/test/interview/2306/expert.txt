 You are given N, t_1, t_2, ..., t_N, and v_1, v_2, ..., v_N. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate N largest possible values of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N t_1 t_2 t_3 … t_N v_1 v_2 v_3 … v_N -----Output----- Print the maximum possible that a train can cover in the run. Output is considered correct if its absolute difference from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}. -----Sample Input----- 1 100 30 -----Sample Output----- 2100.000000000000000 The maximum distance is achieved when a train runs as follows:  - In the first 30 seconds, it accelerates at a rate of 1m/s^2, covering 450 meters.  - In the subsequent 40 seconds, it maintains the velocity of 30m/s, covering 1200 meters.  - In the last 30 seconds, it decelerates at the acceleration of -1m/s^2, covering 450 meters. The total distance covered is 450 + 1200 + 450 = 2100 meters.
