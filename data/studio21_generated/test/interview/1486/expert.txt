 You are given an array of cities. For each city calculate two values min_i and max_i where min_i is the minimum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city to some other city, and max_i is the the maximum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city to some other city  
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of cities in Lineland. The second line contains the sequence of n distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9), where x_{i} is the x-coordinate of the i-th city. All the x_{i}'s are distinct and follow in ascending order. -----Output----- Print n lines, the i-th line must contain two integers min_{i}, max_{i}, separated by a space, where min_{i} is the minimum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city, and max_{i} is the maximum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city. -----Examples----- Input 4 -5 -2 2 7 Output 3 12 3 9 4 7 5 12 Input 2 -1 1 Output 2 2 2 2
