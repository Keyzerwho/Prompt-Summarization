 You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of movements made by the operator. The second line contains a single integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) — the index of the shell where the ball was found after n movements. -----Output----- Print one integer from 0 to 2 — the index of the shell where the ball was initially placed. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 Output 1 Input 1 1 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample, the ball was initially placed beneath the middle shell and the operator completed four movements.  During the first move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell. The ball is now under the left shell.  During the second move operator swapped the middle shell and the right one. The ball is still under the left shell.  During the third move operator swapped the left shell and the middle shell again. The ball is again in the middle.  Finally, the operators swapped the middle shell and the right shell. The ball is now beneath the right shell.
