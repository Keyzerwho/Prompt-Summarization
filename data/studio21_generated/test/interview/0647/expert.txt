 You are given n students numbered from 1 to n. You need to seat them such that they do not talk to each other and do not bump elbows.
-----Input----- The first input line contains a single even integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of students in the class. The second line contains exactly n capital English letters "L" and "R". If the i-th letter at the second line equals "L", then the student number i is a lefthander, otherwise he is a righthander. -----Output----- Print $\frac{n}{2}$ integer pairs, one pair per line. In the i-th line print the numbers of students that will sit at the i-th desk. The first number in the pair stands for the student who is sitting to the left, and the second number stands for the student who is sitting to the right. Separate the numbers in the pairs by spaces. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 6 LLRLLL Output 1 4 2 5 6 3 Input 4 RRLL Output 3 1 4 2
