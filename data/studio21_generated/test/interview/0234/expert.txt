 You are given an array of integers. You need to check all cells for bombs.  If the cell contains a digit $k$, then all cells $k$ to $k+1$ are checked for bombs.  If the cell is empty, then all cells $1$ to $8$ are checked for bombs. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 100$) â€” the sizes of the field. The next $n$ lines contain the description of the field. Each line contains $m$ characters, each of them is "." (if this cell is empty), "*" (if there is bomb in this cell), or a digit from $1$ to $8$, inclusive. -----Output----- Print "YES", if the field is valid and "NO" otherwise. You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrarily. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 111 1*1 111 Output YES Input 2 4 *.*. 1211 Output NO -----Note----- In the second example the answer is "NO" because, if the positions of the bombs are preserved, the first line of the field should be *2*1.
