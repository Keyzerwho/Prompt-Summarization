 You are given two strings a and b. A string $a$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $b$ if and only if one of the following holds: $a$ is a prefix of $b$, but $a \ne b$; in the first position where $a$ and $b$ differ, the string $a$ has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in $b$. 
-----Input----- The first and the only line contains a string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 1000$), describing the initial string formed by magnets. The string $s$ consists only of characters 'a' and 'b'. -----Output----- Output exactly $|s|$ integers. If IA should reverse the $i$-th prefix (that is, the substring from $1$ to $i$), the $i$-th integer should be equal to $1$, and it should be equal to $0$ otherwise. If there are multiple possible sequences leading to the optimal answer, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input bbab Output 0 1 1 0 Input aaaaa Output 1 0 0 0 1 -----Note----- In the first example, IA can reverse the second and the third prefix and get a string "abbb". She cannot get better result, since it is also lexicographically smallest string obtainable by permuting characters of the initial string. In the second example, she can reverse any subset of prefixes — all letters are 'a'.
