 Given a binary string (length of x), Mishka wants to check if there exists exactly one crossword such that its length and encoding are equal to the length and encoding he picked. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the encoding and the length of the crossword Mishka picked. The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10000) — the encoding. -----Output----- Print YES if there exists exaclty one crossword with chosen length and encoding. Otherwise, print NO. -----Examples----- Input 2 4 1 3 Output NO Input 3 10 3 3 2 Output YES Input 2 10 1 3 Output NO
