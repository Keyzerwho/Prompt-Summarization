 A girl has a cupboard that looks like an arc from ahead. The arc is made of a semicircle with radius r and two walls of height h, where r and h are positive numbers. The cupboard's depth is r, that is, it looks like a rectangle with base r and height h + r from the sides. The figure below shows what the cupboard looks like (the front view is on the left, the side view is on the right). 
-----Input----- The single line contains two integers r, h (1 ≤ r, h ≤ 10^7). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of balloons Xenia can put in the cupboard. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 3 Input 1 2 Output 5 Input 2 1 Output 2
