 You are given a list of numbers. You need to find the largest number of Dragon Balls you can collect. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \leq n,m \leq 200000)$, the number of cities and possible teleport trips. Then follow $m$ lines containing three space-separated integers $a_ i$, $b_ i$, and $t_ i$ each $(1 \le a_ i, b_ i \le n, 0 \le t_ i \le 10000)$, which, as explained above, represent the two cities connected by the teleport trip, and cost to use the teleporter. Then follows one line of seven space-separated integers, representing the city IDs of the seven Dragon Balls showing on the radar. Each ID $c$ satisfies the bound $1 \leq c \leq n$. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to collect all seven Dragon Balls shown on the Dragon Ball radar. If there is no way to complete this task, print $-1$ instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10 9 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 1 4 5 1 5 6 1 6 7 1 7 8 1 8 9 1 9 10 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output: 6
