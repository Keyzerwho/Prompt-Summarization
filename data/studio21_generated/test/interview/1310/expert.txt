 You are given an array $A$ of non-negative integers. You are asked to find there a segment of consecutive elements, such that the xor of all numbers from this segment is maximal possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the array. The second line contains the space-separated integers from the array. All numbers are non-negative integers strictly less than 2^30. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the required maximal xor of a segment of consecutive elements. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 1 1 2 Output 3 Input 3 1 2 7 Output 7 Input 4 4 2 4 8 Output 14 -----Note----- In the first sample one of the optimal segments is the segment that consists of the first and the second array elements, if we consider the array elements indexed starting from one. The second sample contains only one optimal segment, which contains exactly one array element (element with index three).
