 You are given an array with m devices and k sockets. You need to find minimum number of supply-line filters from the given set that will plug all the devices to electricity. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 50) — the number of supply-line filters, the number of devices and the number of sockets that he can plug to directly, correspondingly. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 50) — number a_{i} stands for the number of sockets on the i-th supply-line filter. -----Output----- Print a single number — the minimum number of supply-line filters that is needed to plug all the devices to electricity. If it is impossible to plug all the devices even using all the supply-line filters, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 3 3 1 2 Output 1 Input 4 7 2 3 3 2 4 Output 2 Input 5 5 1 1 3 1 2 1 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first test case he can plug the first supply-line filter directly to electricity. After he plug it, he get 5 (3 on the supply-line filter and 2 remaining sockets for direct plugging) available sockets to plug. Thus, one filter is enough to plug 5 devices. One of the optimal ways in the second test sample is to plug the second supply-line filter directly and plug the fourth supply-line filter to one of the sockets in the second supply-line filter. Thus, he gets exactly 7 sockets, available to plug: one to plug to the electricity directly, 2 on the second supply-line filter, 4 on the fourth supply-line filter. There's no way he can plug 7 devices if he use one supply-line filter.
