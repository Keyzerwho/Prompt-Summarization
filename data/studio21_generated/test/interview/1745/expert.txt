 Given two strings a and b return true if a can be constructed from string charecters in b else false. Each letter in the b string can only be used once in your a string. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) — the height and width of Berland map. Each of the next n lines contains m characters — the map of the city.  If the square of the map is marked by character '.', then the square is empty and the pipe can through it.  If the square of the map is marked by character '#', then the square is full and the pipe can't through it. -----Output----- In the first line of the output print a single integer — the number of distinct ways to create a pipe. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 ... ..# ... Output 3 Input 4 2 .. .. .. .. Output 2 Input 4 5 #...# #...# ###.# ###.# Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample there are 3 ways to make a pipe (the squares of the pipe are marked by characters ' * '):         .*.        .*.        ...        .*#        **#        **#        .*.        ...        .*.
