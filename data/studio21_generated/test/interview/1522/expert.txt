 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of rooms in the house. The second line of the input contains string s of length 2·n - 2. Let's number the elements of the string from left to right, starting from one.  The odd positions in the given string s contain lowercase Latin letters — the types of the keys that lie in the corresponding rooms. Thus, each odd position i of the given string s contains a lowercase Latin letter — the type of the key that lies in room number (i + 1) / 2. The even positions in the given string contain uppercase Latin letters — the types of doors between the rooms. Thus, each even position i of the given string s contains an uppercase letter — the type of the door that leads from room i / 2 to room i / 2 + 1. -----Output----- Print the only integer — the minimum number of keys that Vitaly needs to buy to surely get from room one to room n. -----Examples----- Input 3 aAbB Output 0 Input 4 aBaCaB Output 3 Input 5 xYyXzZaZ Output 2
