 You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ operations with this array: during the $i$-th operation: choose two neighbouring marbles, and swap them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5)$ â€” the number of marbles. The second line contains an integer sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 20)$, where $a_i$ is the color of the $i$-th marble. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of operations Monocarp has to perform to achieve his goal. -----Examples----- Input 7 3 4 2 3 4 2 2 Output 3 Input 5 20 1 14 10 2 Output 0 Input 13 5 5 4 4 3 5 7 6 5 4 4 6 5 Output 21 -----Note----- In the first example three operations are enough. Firstly, Monocarp should swap the third and the fourth marbles, so the sequence of colors is $[3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2, 2]$. Then Monocarp should swap the second and the third marbles, so the sequence is $[3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 2, 2]$. And finally, Monocarp should swap the fourth and the fifth marbles, so the sequence is $[3, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]$.  In the second example there's no need to perform any operations.
