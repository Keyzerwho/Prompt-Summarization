 Vanya and Vova wonder who makes the last hit on each monster. If Vanya and Vova make the last hit at the same time, we assume that both of them have made the last hit. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n,x,y (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^6) — the number of monsters, the frequency of Vanya's and Vova's attack, correspondingly. Next n lines contain integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the number of hits needed do destroy the i-th monster. -----Output----- Print n lines. In the i-th line print word "Vanya", if the last hit on the i-th monster was performed by Vanya, "Vova", if Vova performed the last hit, or "Both", if both boys performed it at the same time. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 Output Vanya Vova Vanya Both Input 2 1 1 1 2 Output Both Both -----Note----- In the first sample Vanya makes the first hit at time 1 / 3, Vova makes the second hit at time 1 / 2, Vanya makes the third hit at time 2 / 3, and both boys make the fourth and fifth hit simultaneously at the time 1. In the second sample Vanya and Vova make the first and second hit simultaneously at time 1.
