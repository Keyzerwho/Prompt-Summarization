 You are given a sequence of numbers. You need to output the length of the longest non-decreasing subsegment in the sequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,  a_2,  ...,  a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence a. -----Examples----- Input 6 2 2 1 3 4 1 Output 3 Input 3 2 2 9 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one. In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.
