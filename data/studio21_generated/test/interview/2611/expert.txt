 You are given a pile of trash. The coordinate of this pile is $x$. You want to know the number of steps you need to spend to clean this pile of trash. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, q \le 10^5$) â€” the number of piles in the room before all queries and the number of queries, respectively. The second line of the input contains $n$ distinct integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^9$), where $p_i$ is the coordinate of the $i$-th pile. The next $q$ lines describe queries. The $i$-th query is described with two integers $t_i$ and $x_i$ ($0 \le t_i \le 1; 1 \le x_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is $0$ if you need to remove a pile from the coordinate $x_i$ and is $1$ if you need to add a pile to the coordinate $x_i$. It is guaranteed that for $t_i = 0$ there is such pile in the current set of piles and for $t_i = 1$ there is no such pile in the current set of piles. -----Output----- Print $q+1$ integers: the minimum number of moves Vova needs to do a total cleanup before the first query and after each of $q$ queries. -----Examples----- Input 5 6 1 2 6 8 10 1 4 1 9 0 6 0 10 1 100 1 50 Output 5 7 7 5 4 8 49 Input 5 8 5 1 2 4 3 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 1 1000000000 1 1 1 500000000 Output 3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 499999999 -----Note----- Consider the first example. Initially, the set of piles is $[1, 2, 6, 8, 10]$. The answer before the first query is $5$ because you can move all piles from $1$ to $2$ with one move, all piles from $10$ to $8$ with $2$ moves and all piles from $6$ to $8$ with $2$ moves. After the first query, the set becomes $[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]$. Then the answer is $7$ because you can move all piles from $6$ to $4$ with $2$ moves, all piles from $4$ to $2$ with $2$ moves, all piles from $2$ to $1$ with $1$ move and all piles from $10$ to $8$ with $2$ moves. After the second query, the set of piles becomes $[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]$ and the answer is the same (and the previous sequence of moves can be applied to the current set of piles). After the third query, the set of piles becomes $[1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10]$ and the answer is $5$ because you can move all piles from $1$ to $2$ with $1$ move, all piles from $2$ to $4$ with $2$ moves, all piles from $10$ to $9$ with $1$ move and all piles from $9$ to $8$ with $1$ move. After the fourth query, the set becomes $[1, 2, 4, 8, 9]$ and the answer is almost the same (the previous sequence of moves can be applied without moving piles from $10$). After the fifth query, the set becomes $[1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 100]$. You can move all piles from $1$ and further to $9$ and keep $100$ at its place. So the answer is $8$. After the sixth query, the set becomes $[1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 50, 100]$. The answer is $49$ and can be obtained with almost the same sequence of moves as after the previous query. The only difference is that you need to move all piles from $50$ to $9$ too.
