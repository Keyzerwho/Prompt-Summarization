 You are given a graph with n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1. For all 0   u < v < n, vertex u and vertex v are connected with an undirected edge that has weight $u \oplus v$ (where $\oplus$ is the bitwise-xor operation). Find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of that graph
-----Input----- The only line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^12), the number of vertices in the graph. -----Output----- The only line contains an integer x, the weight of the graph's minimum spanning tree. -----Example----- Input 4 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample: [Image] The weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1+2+1=4.
