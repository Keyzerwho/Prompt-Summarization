 You are given an integer array a of size n. You want to swap two elements such that number of swap function calls decreases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the length of the permutation. The second line contains n different integers from 0 to n - 1, inclusive — the actual permutation. -----Output----- Print two integers: the minimum number of times the swap function is executed and the number of such pairs (i, j) that swapping the elements of the input permutation with indexes i and j leads to the minimum number of the executions. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 0 3 1 2 Output 3 2 Input 5 1 2 3 4 0 Output 3 4 -----Note----- In the first sample the appropriate pairs are (0, 3) and (0, 4).  In the second sample the appropriate pairs are (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4) and (3, 4).
