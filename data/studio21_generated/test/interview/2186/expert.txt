 You are given n initial lines, m queries, and a memory filled with n strings. You need to write a program that will check if the memory contains string t that consists of the same number of characters as s and differs from s in exactly one position. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two non-negative numbers n and m (0 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of the initial strings and the number of queries, respectively. Next follow n non-empty strings that are uploaded to the memory of the mechanism. Next follow m non-empty strings that are the queries to the mechanism. The total length of lines in the input doesn't exceed 6·10^5. Each line consists only of letters 'a', 'b', 'c'. -----Output----- For each query print on a single line "YES" (without the quotes), if the memory of the mechanism contains the required string, otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 2 3 aaaaa acacaca aabaa ccacacc caaac Output YES NO NO
