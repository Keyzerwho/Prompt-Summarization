 You are given the number of papers of different sizes that Bj rn has. Find how much tape he needs to make an A1 paper. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $2\leq n \leq 30$, the A-size of the smallest papers Björn has. The second line contains $n-1$ integers giving the number of sheets he has of each paper size starting with A2 and ending with A$n$. Björn doesn’t have more than $10^9$ sheets of any paper size. -----Output----- If Björn has enough paper to make an A1 paper, output a single floating point number, the smallest total length of tape needed in meters. Otherwise output “impossible”. The output number should have an absolute error of at most $10^{-5}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 0 5 Sample Output: 1.60965532263
