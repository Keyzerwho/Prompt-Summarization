 You are given the information about free and booked places in each of the N cars. Find the number of ways to sell the friends exactly X tickets in one compartment (note that the order in which the tickets are sold doesn't matter). 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers X and N (1 ≤ X ≤ 6, 1 ≤ N ≤ 10) separated by a single space. Each of the following N lines contains the information about one car which is a string of length 54 consisting of '0' and '1'. The i-th character (numbered from 1) is '0' if place i in the corresponding car is free, and is '1' if place i is already booked. -----Output----- Output just one integer -- the requested number of ways. -----Example----- Input: 1 3 100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101 001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010 011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010 Output: 85 Input: 6 3 100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101 001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010 011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010 Output: 1 Input: 3 2 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Output: 360 Explanation: In the first test case, any of the free places can be sold. In the second test case, the only free compartment in the train is compartment 3 in the first car (places 9, 10, 11, 12, 49 and 50 are all free). In the third test case, the train is still absolutely free; as there are 20 ways to sell 3 tickets in an empty compartment, the answer is 2 * 9 * 20 = 360.
