 You are given an array (l_{i}, r_{i}), where l_{i} and r_{i} are integers, i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n.  You need to find total length of parts of the dryer that Alexey may use in such way that clothes of the others (n - 1) students aren't drying there. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The (i + 1)-th line contains integers l_{i} and r_{i} (0 ≤ l_{i} < r_{i} ≤ 100) — the endpoints of the corresponding segment for the i-th student. -----Output----- On a single line print a single number k, equal to the sum of lengths of the parts of the dryer which are inside Alexey's segment and are outside all other segments. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 5 2 8 1 6 Output 1 Input 3 0 10 1 5 7 15 Output 3 -----Note----- Note that it's not important are clothes drying on the touching segments (e.g. (0, 1) and (1, 2)) considered to be touching or not because you need to find the length of segments. In the first test sample Alexey may use the only segment (0, 1). In such case his clothes will not touch clothes on the segments (1, 6) and (2, 8). The length of segment (0, 1) is 1. In the second test sample Alexey may dry his clothes on segments (0, 1) and (5, 7). Overall length of these segments is 3.
