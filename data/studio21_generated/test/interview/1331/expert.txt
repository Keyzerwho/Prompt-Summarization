 =====Problem Statement===== Given an alphanumeric string, find minimum number of alarm clocks Vitalya should turn off to sleep all next day. 
-----Input----- First line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^6) — number of alarm clocks, and conditions of Vitalya's waking up.  Second line contains sequence of distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) in which a_{i} equals minute on which i-th alarm clock will ring. Numbers are given in arbitrary order. Vitalya lives in a Berland in which day lasts for 10^6 minutes.  -----Output----- Output minimal number of alarm clocks that Vitalya should turn off to sleep all next day long. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 2 3 5 1 Output 1 Input 5 10 3 12 8 18 25 1 Output 0 Input 7 7 2 7 3 4 1 6 5 2 Output 6 Input 2 2 2 1 3 Output 0 -----Note----- In first example Vitalya should turn off first alarm clock which rings at minute 3. In second example Vitalya shouldn't turn off any alarm clock because there are no interval of 10 consequence minutes in which 3 alarm clocks will ring. In third example Vitalya should turn off any 6 alarm clocks.
