 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum number of hugs you can get. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of months in the year and the number of days you can spend with your friend. The second line contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$, $d_i$ is the number of days in the $i$-th month ($1 \le d_i \le 10^6$). It is guaranteed that $1 \le x \le d_1 + d_2 + \ldots + d_n$. -----Output----- Print one integer — the maximum number of hugs that you can get from Coronavirus-chan during the best vacation in your life. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 3 1 Output 5 Input 3 6 3 3 3 Output 12 Input 5 6 4 2 3 1 3 Output 15 -----Note----- In the first test case, the numbers of the days in a year are (indices of days in a corresponding month) $\{1,1,2,3,1\}$. Coronavirus-chan will hug you the most if you come on the third day of the year: $2+3=5$ hugs. In the second test case, the numbers of the days are $\{1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3\}$. You will get the most hugs if you arrive on the third day of the year: $3+1+2+3+1+2=12$ hugs. In the third test case, the numbers of the days are $\{1,2,3,4,1,2, 1,2,3, 1, 1,2,3\}$. You will get the most hugs if you come on the twelfth day of the year: your friend will hug you $2+3+1+2+3+4=15$ times.
