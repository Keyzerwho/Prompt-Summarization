 Given a set of potential answers to a question, find the alternative that is easiest to change into any other alternative. 
-----Input----- The first line is the question to be answered. The next line contains one positive integer $1 \leq N \leq 100$, giving the number of answer alternatives. The next $N$ lines contain one alternative each. The alternatives are lists of parts, separated by a comma and a space. All answers have the same number of parts, at most 100. All parts are strings of letters a-z and A-Z, digits 0-9 and spaces. Each part doesnâ€™t contain leading or trailing spaces (except the space after a comma that separates 2 parts). The maximal length of a part is 50 characters. -----Output----- Output the alternative that requires the smallest maximum amount of changes to be turned into any other answer. If there are several least incongruous alternatives, output them all in the same order as in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: The flag of the empire Angola? 4 Green stripe, black stripe, yellow Red stripe, black stripe, yellow Red stripe, black stripe, white Red stripe, green stripe, yellow Sample Output: Red stripe, black stripe, yellow
