 Given $N$ material events, label the events $1, 2, \dots , N$. The prosecution claims that these events happened in the order $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$, while the defense claims that these events instead happened in the order $D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$. It is guaranteed that exactly one of the two is right; in particular, this also means that the prosecution and defense do not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists some $i$ such that $P_ i \neq D_ i$. Define a consistent recollection as a subset of the $N$ events, in some order, such that these events happening in this order is consistent with at least one of the two parties claims. (That is, at least one of the parties claimed that this subset of events did happen in this order, although it is possible that some other events happened before, after, or in between.) You need to determine  - the minimum $k_ p$ such that there is some consistent recollection of $k_ p$ events where it is possible to determine for sure who is right, and  - the minimum $k_ r$ such that for any consistent recollection of $k_ r$ events, it is possible to determine
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 200000$), the number of events. The second line of input contains $N$ integers, $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$ ($1 \leq P_ i \leq N$; all $P_ i$ are distinct), the order of events according to the prosecution. That is, according to the prosecution, the $i^\text {th}$ event was the event labelled $P_ i$. The third line of input contains $N$ integers, $D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$ ($1 \leq D_ i \leq N$; all $D_ i$ are distinct), the order of events according to the defense. That is, according to the defense, the $i^\text {th}$ event was the event labelled $D_ i$. It is guaranteed that the prosecution and defense do not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists some $i$ such that $P_ i \neq D_ i$. -----Output----- Output two integers on a single line, the minimum values of $k_ p$ and $k_ r$, respectively, as described in the problem statement. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 2 4 1 1 3 4 2 Sample Output: 2 3
