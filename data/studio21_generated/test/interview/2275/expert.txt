The description of the group starts with an integer $k_i$ ($1 \le k_i \le 100$) — the number of students in the group, followed by a string $s_i$, consisting of $k_i$ letters "A" and "P", which describes the $i$-th group of students. -----Output----- For every group output single integer — the last moment a student becomes angry. -----Examples----- Input 1 4 PPAP Output 1 Input 3 12 APPAPPPAPPPP 3 AAP 3 PPA Output 4 1 0 -----Note----- In the first test, after $1$ minute the state of students becomes PPAA.
