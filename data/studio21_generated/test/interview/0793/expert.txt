 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M S_1 S_2 ... S_{N-1} S_{N} T_1 T_2 ... T_{M-1} T_{M} -----Output----- Print the number of pairs of a subsequence of S and a subsequence of T such that the subsequences are the same in content, modulo 10^9+7. -----Sample Input----- 2 2 1 3 3 1 -----Sample Output----- 3 S has four subsequences: (), (1), (3), (1, 3). T has four subsequences: (), (3), (1), (3, 1). There are 1 \times 1 pair of subsequences in which the subsequences are both (), 1 \times 1 pair of subsequences in which the subsequences are both (1), and 1 \times 1 pair of subsequences in which the subsequences are both (3), for a total of three pairs.
