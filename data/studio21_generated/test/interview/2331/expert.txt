 You are given two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^4$). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint $0$, then we paint $1$, then $2$ and so on. Each number is painted white or black. We paint a number $i$ according to the following rules:   if $i = 0$, it is colored white;   if $i \ge a$ and $i - a$ is colored white, $i$ is also colored white;   if $i \ge b$ and $i - b$ is colored white, $i$ is also colored white;   if $i$ is still not colored white, it is colored black.  In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors. For example, if $a=3$, $b=5$, then the colors of the numbers (in the order from $0$) are: white ($0$), black ($1$), black (
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ lines follow, each line contains two space-separated integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^4$). -----Output----- For each test case, print one line containing either "Infinite" or "Finite" (without the quotes). Output is case-insensitive (i.e. "infinite", "inFiNite" or "finiTE" are all valid answers). -----Example----- Input 4 10 10 1 10 6 9 7 3 Output Infinite Finite Infinite Finite
