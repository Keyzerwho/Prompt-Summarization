 You are given a list of n integers and n integers. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after d days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of characters in the slogan and the initial position of the ladder, correspondingly. The next line contains the slogan as n characters written without spaces. Each character of the slogan is either a large English letter, or digit, or one of the characters: '.', '!', ',', '?'. -----Output----- In t lines, print the actions the programmers need to make. In the i-th line print:  "LEFT" (without the quotes), if the i-th action was "move the ladder to the left";  "RIGHT" (without the quotes), if the i-th action was "move the ladder to the right";  "PRINT x" (without the quotes), if the i-th action was to "go up the ladder, paint character x, go down the ladder".  The painting time (variable t) must be minimum possible. If there are multiple optimal painting plans, you can print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 R1 Output PRINT 1 LEFT PRINT R Input 2 1 R1 Output PRINT R RIGHT PRINT 1 Input 6 4 GO?GO! Output RIGHT RIGHT PRINT ! LEFT PRINT O LEFT PRINT G LEFT PRINT ? LEFT PRINT O LEFT PRINT G -----Note----- Note that the ladder cannot be shifted by less than one meter. The ladder can only stand in front of some square of the poster. For example, you cannot shift a ladder by half a meter and position it between two squares. Then go up and paint the first character and the second character.
