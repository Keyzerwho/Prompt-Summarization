 Given are positive integers A and B. Let us choose some number of positive common divisors of A and B. Here, any two of the chosen divisors must be coprime. At most, how many divisors can we choose 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: A B -----Output----- Print the maximum number of divisors that can be chosen to satisfy the condition. -----Sample Input----- 12 18 -----Sample Output----- 3 12 and 18 have the following positive common divisors: 1, 2, 3, and 6. 1 and 2 are coprime, 2 and 3 are coprime, and 3 and 1 are coprime, so we can choose 1, 2, and 3, which achieve the maximum result.
