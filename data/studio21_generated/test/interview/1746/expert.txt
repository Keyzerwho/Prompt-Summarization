 You are given a tree. Check whether it's a spruce. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n — the number of vertices in the tree (3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000). Each of the next n - 1 lines contains one integer p_{i} (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) — the index of the parent of the i + 1-th vertex (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ i). Vertex 1 is the root. It's guaranteed that the root has at least 2 children. -----Output----- Print "Yes" if the tree is a spruce and "No" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 1 1 Output Yes Input 7 1 1 1 2 2 2 Output No Input 8 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 Output Yes -----Note----- The first example: [Image] The second example: $8$ It is not a spruce, because the non-leaf vertex 1 has only 2 leaf children. The third example: [Image]
