 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $m$ integers. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $m$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns in the depot field.  The next n lines contain m symbols "." and "*" each — the description of the field. j-th symbol in i-th of them stands for cell (i, j). If the symbol is equal to ".", then the corresponding cell is empty, otherwise it equals "*" and the corresponding cell is occupied by a wall. -----Output----- If it is impossible to wipe out all walls by placing and triggering exactly one bomb, then print "NO" in the first line (without quotes). Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line and two integers in the second line — the coordinates of the cell at which the bomb should be laid. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 .*.. .... .*.. Output YES 1 2 Input 3 3 ..* .*. *.. Output NO Input 6 5 ..*.. ..*.. ***** ..*.. ..*.. ..*.. Output YES 3 3
