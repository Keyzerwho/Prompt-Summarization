 You are given three integers, the number of students, the number of teachers, and the size of the class sections. You need to determine if it is possible to load students onto 3 buses such that the class sections have same number of students. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer $N$, the number of class sections ($3 \le N \le 1000000$). The second line of input contains $N$ integers, the $i^{\text {th}}$ integer represents the size of class section with number $i$. Class section sizes can range from $[1, 10000]$. -----Output----- If it is possible to load the students onto three identical buses in the above-described fashion and have a teacher free bus ride, then output two integers $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i < j < n$) where $i$ is the number of the class section which is to be loaded last into the first bus, and $j$ is the class section which is to be loaded last into the second bus. We can assume the third bus will load class sections $j+1$ to $n$. If it is not possible, print “-1”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 3 3 Sample Output 1: 1 2 Sample Input 2: 3 9 10 11 Sample Output 2: -1 Sample Input 3: 9 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Sample Output 3: 3 6
