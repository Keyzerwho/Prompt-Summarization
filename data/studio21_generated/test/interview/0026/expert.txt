 You are given three numbers. You need to find the smallest number such that its square, cube and 4th power is equal to given numbers. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains three space-separated real numbers x, y and z (0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0). Each of x, y and z is given with exactly one digit after the decimal point. -----Output----- Find the maximum value of expression among x^{y}^{z}, x^{z}^{y}, (x^{y})^{z}, (x^{z})^{y}, y^{x}^{z}, y^{z}^{x}, (y^{x})^{z}, (y^{z})^{x}, z^{x}^{y}, z^{y}^{x}, (z^{x})^{y}, (z^{y})^{x} and print the corresponding expression. If there are many maximums, print the one that comes first in the list.  x^{y}^{z} should be outputted as x^y^z (without brackets), and (x^{y})^{z} should be outputted as (x^y)^z (quotes for clarity).  -----Examples----- Input 1.1 3.4 2.5 Output z^y^x Input 2.0 2.0 2.0 Output x^y^z Input 1.9 1.8 1.7 Output (x^y)^z
