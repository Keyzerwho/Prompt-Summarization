 Given two integers $a$ and $b$ return the number of shortest paths between $a$ and $b$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $D$ ($1 \le D \le 10^{15}$) — the number the graph is built from. The second line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries. Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \le v, u \le D$). It is guaranteed that $D$ is divisible by both $v$ and $u$ (both $v$ and $u$ are divisors of $D$). -----Output----- Print $q$ integers — for each query output the number of the shortest paths between the two given vertices modulo $998244353$. -----Examples----- Input 12 3 4 4 12 1 3 4 Output 1 3 1 Input 1 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 288807105787200 4 46 482955026400 12556830686400 897 414 12556830686400 4443186242880 325 Output 547558588 277147129 457421435 702277623 -----Note----- In the first example:   The first query is only the empty path — length $0$;  The second query are paths $[(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)]$ (length $3+1+1=5$), $[(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)]$ (length $2+2+1=5$) and $[(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)]$ (length $2+2+1=5$).  The third query is only the path $[(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)]$ (length $1+1+1=3$).
