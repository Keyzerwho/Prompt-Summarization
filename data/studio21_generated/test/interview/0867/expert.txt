 You are given N guests: N - 1 real zombies and a fake one, our Heidi. The living-dead love hierarchies as much as they love brains: each one has a unique rank in the range 1 to N - 1, and Heidi, who still appears slightly different from the others, is attributed the highest rank, N. Tonight there will be a chest with brains on display and every attendee sees how many there are. These will then be split among the attendees according to the following procedure: The zombie of the highest rank makes a suggestion on who gets how many brains (every brain is an indivisible entity). A vote follows. If at least half of the attendees accept the offer, the brains are shared in the suggested way and the feast begins. But if majority is not reached, then the highest-ranked zombie is killed, and the next zombie in hierarchy has to make a suggestion. If he is killed too, then the third highest-ranked makes one, etc. (It's enough to have exactly half of the votes   in case of a tie, the vote of the highest-ranked alive zombie counts twice, and he will of course vote in favor of his own suggestion in order to stay alive.) You should know that zombies are very greedy and sly, and they know this too   basically all zombie brains are alike. Consequently,
-----Input----- The only line of input contains one integer: N, the number of attendees (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Output one integer: the smallest number of brains in the chest which allows Heidi to take one brain home. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1 Input 4 Output 2 -----Note-----
