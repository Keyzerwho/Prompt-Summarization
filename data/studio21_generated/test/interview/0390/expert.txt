 You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $n$, $a$, and $b$ ($1 \leq n \leq 20$, $1 \leq a, b \leq 100$) — the number of dancers, the cost of a white suit, and the cost of a black suit. The next line contains $n$ numbers $c_i$, $i$-th of which denotes the color of the suit of the $i$-th dancer. Number $0$ denotes the white color, $1$ — the black color, and $2$ denotes that a suit for this dancer is still to be bought. -----Output----- If it is not possible to form a palindrome without swapping dancers and buying new suits for those who have one, then output -1. Otherwise, output the minimal price to get the desired visual effect. -----Examples----- Input 5 100 1 0 1 2 1 2 Output 101 Input 3 10 12 1 2 0 Output -1 Input 3 12 1 0 1 0 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample, the cheapest way to obtain palindromic colors is to buy a black suit for the third from left dancer and a white suit for the rightmost dancer. In the second sample, the leftmost dancer's suit already differs from the rightmost dancer's suit so there is no way to obtain the desired coloring. In the third sample, all suits are already bought and their colors form a palindrome.
