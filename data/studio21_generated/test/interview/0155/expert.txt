 you are given a list of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 
-----Input----- The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type! -----Output----- Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 0 Output 1 1 Input 4 3 11 Output 1 2 Input 4 3 7 Output 3 2 -----Note----- Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
