-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of guilty people. Second line contains n space-separated integers L_1, L_2, ..., L_{n} (0 ≤ L_{i} ≤ 10^9), where L_{i} is the length of the i-th person's claw. -----Output----- Print one integer — the total number of alive people after the bell rings. -----Examples----- Input 4 0 1 0 10 Output 1 Input 2 0 0 Output 2 Input 10 1 1 3 0 0 0 2 1 0 3 Output 3 -----Note----- In first sample the last person kills everyone in front of him.
