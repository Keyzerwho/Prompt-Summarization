 You are given an n x n square field. You have to put bombs on the field. You have to paint the field in such a way that every cell contains at least one number. 
-----Input----- The first line contains sequence of characters without spaces s_1s_2... s_{n} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), containing only characters "*", "?" and digits "0", "1" or "2". If character s_{i} equals "*", then the i-th cell of the field contains a bomb. If character s_{i} equals "?", then Valera hasn't yet decided what to put in the i-th cell. Character s_{i}, that is equal to a digit, represents the digit written in the i-th square. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of ways Valera can fill the empty cells and get a correct field. As the answer can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input ?01??? Output 4 Input ? Output 2 Input **12 Output 0 Input 1 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first test sample you can get the following correct fields: 001**1, 001***, 001*2*, 001*10.
