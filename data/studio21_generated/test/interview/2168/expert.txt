 You are given two companies, A and B. The companies' maximum salaries are $a$ and $b$. The companies' employees have salaries $c$ and $d$. The companies' maximum salaries are $a+c$ and $b+d$. The companies' employees have salaries $c+d$ and $a+b$. The companies' maximum salaries are $a+c+d$ and $b+d+a$. The companies' employees have salaries $c+d+a$ and $a+b+d$. The companies' maximum salaries are $a+c+d+a$ and $b+d+a+c$. The companies' employees have salaries $c+d+a+c$ and $a+b+d+c$. The companies' maximum salaries are $a+c+d+a+c$ and $b+d+a+c+d$. The companies'
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ — the number of companies in the conglomerate ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). Each of the next $n$ lines describes a company.  A company description start with an integer $m_i$ — the number of its employees ($1 \le m_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). Then $m_i$ integers follow: the salaries of the employees. All salaries are positive and do not exceed $10^9$.  The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.  -----Output----- Output a single integer — the minimal total increase of all employees that allows to merge all companies. -----Example----- Input 3 2 4 3 2 2 1 3 1 1 1 Output 13 -----Note----- One of the optimal merging strategies is the following. First increase all salaries in the second company by $2$, and merge the first and the second companies. Now the conglomerate consists of two companies with salaries $[4, 3, 4, 3]$ and $[1, 1, 1]$. To merge them, increase the salaries in the second of those by $3$. The total increase is $2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13$.
