 Cindy Lou wants to know the minimum number of k kilos of sweets they need to take with them, to have time to give sweets to the residents of each house in their street. Your task is to write a program that will determine the minimum possible value of k.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and t (2 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9). The second line of the input contains n characters, the i-th of them equals "H" (if the i-th segment contains a house), "S" (if the i-th segment contains a shop) or "." (if the i-th segment doesn't contain a house or a shop).  It is guaranteed that there is at least one segment with a house. -----Output----- If there isn't a single value of k that makes it possible to give sweets to everybody in at most t units of time, print in a single line "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print on a single line the minimum possible value of k. -----Examples----- Input 6 6 HSHSHS Output 1 Input 14 100 ...HHHSSS...SH Output 0 Input 23 50 HHSS.......SSHHHHHHHHHH Output 8 -----Note----- In the first example, there are as many stores, as houses. If the family do not take a single kilo of sweets from home, in order to treat the inhabitants of the first house, they will need to make at least one step back, and they have absolutely no time for it. If they take one kilogram of sweets, they won't need to go back. In the second example, the number of shops is equal to the number of houses and plenty of time. Available at all stores passing out candy in one direction and give them when passing in the opposite direction. In the third example, the shops on the street are fewer than houses. The Lou Whos have to take the missing number of kilograms of sweets with them from home.
