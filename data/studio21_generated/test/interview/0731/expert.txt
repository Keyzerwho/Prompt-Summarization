 You are given an integer m (m, m + 1, ...). Your task is to make a consecutive integer sequence starting from number m (m, m + 1, ...). But you need to pay S(n) k to add the number n to the sequence. You can spend a cost up to w, and you want to make the sequence as long as possible. Write a program that tells sequence's maximum length. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^16), m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^16), k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Output----- The first line should contain a single integer — the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 9 1 1 Output 9 Input 77 7 7 Output 7 Input 114 5 14 Output 6 Input 1 1 2 Output 0
