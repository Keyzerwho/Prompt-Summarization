 You are given an array of numbers. Make sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The next line contains n integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1  ≤  h_{i}  ≤  10^5) representing the heights of the pylons. -----Output----- Print a single number representing the minimum number of dollars paid by Caisa. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 4 3 2 4 Output 4 Input 3 4 4 4 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample he can pay 4 dollars and increase the height of pylon with number 0 by 4 units. Then he can safely pass to the last pylon.
