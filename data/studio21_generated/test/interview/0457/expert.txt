 You have two numbers. Find the product of all prime factors of the first number. Multiply this product by the product of all prime factors of the second number. 
-----Input----- The only line contains integers $x$ and $n$ ($2 \le x \le 10^{9}$, $1 \le n \le 10^{18}$) — the numbers used in formula. -----Output----- Print the answer. -----Examples----- Input 10 2 Output 2 Input 20190929 1605 Output 363165664 Input 947 987654321987654321 Output 593574252 -----Note----- In the first example, $f(10, 1) = g(1, 2) \cdot g(1, 5) = 1$, $f(10, 2) = g(2, 2) \cdot g(2, 5) = 2$. In the second example, actual value of formula is approximately $1.597 \cdot 10^{171}$. Make sure you print the answer modulo $(10^{9} + 7)$. In the third example, be careful about overflow issue.
