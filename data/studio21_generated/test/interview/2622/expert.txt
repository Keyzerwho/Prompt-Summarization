-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 200, M ≤ N). The next N lines each contain M lower-case Latin characters (a-z), denoting the first map. Different characters correspond to different cosmic object types. The next M lines each contain N characters, describing the second map in the same format.  -----Output----- The only line of the output should contain two space-separated integers i and j, denoting that the section of size M × M in the first map that starts at the i-th row is equal to the section of the second map that starts at the j-th column. Rows and columns are numbered starting from 1. If there are several possible ways to align the maps, Heidi will be satisfied with any of those. It is guaranteed that a solution exists. -----Example----- Input 10 5 somer andom noise mayth eforc ebewi thyou hctwo again noise somermayth andomeforc noiseebewi againthyou noisehctwo Output 4 6 -----Note----- The 5-by-5 grid for the first test case looks like this:  mayth eforc ebewi thyou hctwo
