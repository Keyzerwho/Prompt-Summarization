 You are given two series of non-negative integers. The first series describes the number of journeys the bus makes and the second series describes the number of liters of gasoline it consumes.  You need to find the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the point x = f to make k journeys 
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers a, b, f, k (0 < f < a ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^4) — the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity of the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and the required number of journeys. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel to make k journeys. If it is impossible for the bus to make k journeys, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 6 9 2 4 Output 4 Input 6 10 2 4 Output 2 Input 6 5 4 3 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example the bus needs to refuel during each journey. In the second example the bus can pass 10 units of distance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4 units of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the gas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2 units of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive at the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10 liters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey. At the end of the journey the tank will be empty.  In the third example the bus can not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey, the tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8 units of distance until next refueling.
