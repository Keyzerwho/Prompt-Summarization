 You have a list of integers, and you want to reorder it in such a way that the resulting string has the maximum possible noise. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of strings in robot's memory. Next n lines contain the strings t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n}, one per line. It is guaranteed that the strings are non-empty, contain only English letters 's' and 'h' and their total length does not exceed 10^5. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maxumum possible noise Imp can achieve by changing the order of the strings. -----Examples----- Input 4 ssh hs s hhhs Output 18 Input 2 h s Output 1 -----Note----- The optimal concatenation in the first sample is ssshhshhhs.
