 You are given two strings $a$ and $b$. $a$ and $b$ are of length n, where n is integer. $a$ and $b$ can be of same length or different length. You are asked to find number of substrings of length n such that $f(a, b)$ is even. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a binary string $a$ ($1 \leq |a| \leq 10^6$) — the first string. The second line contains a binary string $b$ ($1 \leq |b| \leq |a|$) — the second string. -----Output----- Print one number — the answer. -----Examples----- Input 01100010 00110 Output 3 Input 1010111110 0110 Output 4 -----Note----- The first example is explained in the legend. In the second example, there are five substrings that satisfy us: $1010$, $0101$, $1111$, $1111$.
