 You are given a tree with root at 1. Every vertex and edge has a number written on it. You need to remove leaves of the tree until there are no sad vertices left. 
-----Input----- In the first line of the input integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) is given — the number of vertices in the tree. In the second line the sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) is given, where a_{i} is the number written on vertex i. The next n - 1 lines describe tree edges: i^{th} of them consists of two integers p_{i} and c_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n,  - 10^9 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9), meaning that there is an edge connecting vertices i + 1 and p_{i} with number c_{i} written on it. -----Output----- Print the only integer — the minimum number of leaves Alyona needs to remove such that there will be no any sad vertex left in the tree. -----Example----- Input 9 88 22 83 14 95 91 98 53 11 3 24 7 -8 1 67 1 64 9 65 5 12 6 -80 3 8 Output 5 -----Note----- The following image represents possible process of removing leaves from the tree:  [Image]
