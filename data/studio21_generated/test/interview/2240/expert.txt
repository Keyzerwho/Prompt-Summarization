 You are given two strings. You have to replace all zeros in string $s$ with some string $r_0$ and all ones in $s$ with some other string $r_1$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a string $s$ ($2 \le |s| \le 10^5$) consisting of zeros and ones — the original signal. The second line contains a string $t$ ($1 \le |t| \le 10^6$) consisting of lowercase English letters only — the received signal. It is guaranteed, that the string $s$ contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of pairs of strings $r_0$ and $r_1$ that transform $s$ to $t$. In case there are no such pairs, print $0$. -----Examples----- Input 01 aaaaaa Output 4 Input 001 kokokokotlin Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example, the possible pairs $(r_0, r_1)$ are as follows:  "a", "aaaaa"  "aa", "aaaa"  "aaaa", "aa"  "aaaaa", "a"   The pair "aaa", "aaa" is not allowed, since $r_0$ and $r_1$ must be different. In the second example, the following pairs are possible:   "ko", "kokotlin"  "koko", "tlin"
