 You are given two strings s and t both of length n and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters. One move is defined as taking contiguous substring of both s and t and reversing it. You need to find if it is possible to make s and t after some sequence of moves 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$): the number of grids of the games.  Each of the next $T$ lines contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$): the size of the side of the grid of the game.  -----Output----- For each grid of the game print the minimum number of turns required to build a chess coloring pattern out of blocks on it. -----Example----- Input 2 3 4 Output 2 3 -----Note----- For $3\times3$ grid ponies can make two following moves: [Image]
