 You have two numbers $M$ and $R$. You have $n$ days. On each day, you either eat $M$ or $R$. You like to eat more food, but your mother's cooking is very simple, so you can't eat anything interesting. You have $i$ days left. You need to find the number of days on which you eat the same food. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 16). The second and third lines of input contain N integers each, all between 0 and 16, inclusive, and represent arrays M and R, respectively. All M[i] are positive, for each i R[i] < M[i]. -----Output----- Output a single real number. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 4}. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 0 Output 0.500000 Input 2 2 3 1 0 Output 0.666667
