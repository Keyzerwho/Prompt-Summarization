 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three space-separated integers n, k, d (1 ≤ n, d ≤ 1000; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- If there is no valid arrangement just print -1. Otherwise print d lines, in each of them print n integers. The j-th integer of the i-th line shows which bus the j-th student has to take on the i-th day. You can assume that the buses are numbered from 1 to k. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 Output 1 1 2  1 2 1  Input 3 2 1 Output -1 -----Note----- Note that two students become close friends only if they share a bus each day. But the bus they share can differ from day to day.
