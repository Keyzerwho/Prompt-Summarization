 You are given an array of integers, each integer represents one law (1   a   b   n - k + 1, b - a   k). Each integer in the array is signed law number. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 0 < 2k ≤ n) — the number of laws accepted by the parliament and the length of one segment in the law list, correspondingly. The next line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} — the absurdity of each law (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print two integers a, b — the beginning of segments that mr. Boosch should choose. That means that the president signs laws with numbers from segments [a; a + k - 1] and [b; b + k - 1]. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum number a. If there still are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum b. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 6 1 1 6 Output 1 4 Input 6 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 1 3 -----Note----- In the first sample mr. Boosch signs laws with numbers from segments [1;2] and [4;5]. The total absurdity of the signed laws equals 3 + 6 + 1 + 6 = 16. In the second sample mr. Boosch signs laws with numbers from segments [1;2] and [3;4]. The total absurdity of the signed laws equals 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
