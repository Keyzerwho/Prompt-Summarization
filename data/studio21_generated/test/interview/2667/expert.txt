 You are given two non-negative integers C1 and C2. Your task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute C1 + C2 + ... + Cn stamps among the members of SCC thus that i'th member would get i stamps. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer N, denoting the number of members of SCC. The second line contains N integers Ci, denoting the numbers of the stamps in the collection of i'th member. -----Output----- The first line should contain YES, if we can obtain the required division, otherwise NO. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000; 1 ≤  Ci ≤ 109. -----Examples----- Input: 5 7 4 1 1 2 Output: YES Input: 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output: NO
