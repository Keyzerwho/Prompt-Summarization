 You are given a tree (not 1-tree) with $n$ vertices, then he will ask you $q$ queries. Each query contains $5$ integers: $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex $a$ to $b$ that contains exactly $k$ edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 10^5$), the number of vertices of the tree. Next $n-1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$, $u \ne v$) each, which means there is an edge between vertex $u$ and $v$. All edges are bidirectional and distinct. Next line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask. Next $q$ lines contain five integers $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$ each ($1 \le x,y,a,b \le n$, $x \ne y$, $1 \le k \le 10^9$) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between $x$ and $y$ does not exist in the original tree. -----Output----- For each query, print "YES" if there exists a path that contains exactly $k$ edges from vertex $a$ to $b$ after adding an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Example----- Input 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 1 3 1 2 2 1 4 1 3 2 1 4 1 3 3 4 2 3 3 9 5 2 3 3 9 Output YES YES NO YES NO -----Note----- The image below describes the tree (circles and solid lines) and the added edges for each query (dotted lines). [Image]  Possible paths for the queries with "YES" answers are:   $1$-st query: $1$ – $3$ – $2$  $2$-nd query: $1$ – $2$ – $3$  $4$-th query: $3$ – $4$ – $2$ – $3$ – $4$ – $2$ – $3$ – $4$ – $2$ – $3$
