 You are given matrix with n rows and m columns. Find matrix with n rows and m columns such that each row and each column can be shifted cyclically by 1. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers n, m and q (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ q ≤ 10 000) — dimensions of the matrix and the number of turns in the experiment, respectively. Next q lines contain turns descriptions, one per line. Each description starts with an integer t_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 3) that defines the type of the operation. For the operation of first and second type integer r_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i} ≤ n) or c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ m) follows, while for the operations of the third type three integers r_{i}, c_{i} and x_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ m,  - 10^9 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9) are given. Operation of the first type (t_{i} = 1) means that signal comes to the input corresponding to row r_{i}, that is it will shift cyclically. Operation of the second type (t_{i} = 2) means that column c_{i} will shift cyclically. Finally, operation of the third type means that at this moment of time cell located in the row r_{i} and column c_{i} stores value x_{i}. -----Output----- Print the description of any valid initial matrix as n lines containing m integers each. All output integers should not exceed 10^9 by their absolute value. If there are multiple valid solutions, output any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 6 2 1 2 2 3 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 3 1 2 8 3 2 1 8 Output 8 2  1 8  Input 3 3 2 1 2 3 2 2 5 Output 0 0 0  0 0 5  0 0 0
