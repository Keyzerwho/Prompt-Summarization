 You are given two integers x_1 and x_2. You need to find minimum number of strokes Snuke takes to travel from (x_1,y_1) to (x_2,y_2). 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: H W K x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 c_{1,1}c_{1,2} .. c_{1,W} c_{2,1}c_{2,2} .. c_{2,W} : c_{H,1}c_{H,2} .. c_{H,W} -----Output----- Print the minimum number of strokes Snuke takes to travel from the square (x_1,y_1) to (x_2,y_2), or print -1 if the travel is impossible. -----Sample Input----- 3 5 2 3 2 3 4 ..... .@..@ ..@.. -----Sample Output----- 5 Initially, Snuke is at the square (3,2). He can reach the square (3, 4) by making five strokes as follows:  - From (3, 2), go west one square to (3, 1).  - From (3, 1), go north two squares to (1, 1).  - From (1, 1), go east two squares to (1, 3).  - From (1, 3), go east one square to (1, 4).  - From (1, 4), go south two squares to (3, 4).
