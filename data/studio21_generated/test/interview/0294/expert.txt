 Given n (1   n   24) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, you have to check if these integers could be durations in days of n consecutive months, according to Gregorian calendar. Note that these months could belong to several consecutive years. In other words, check if there is a month in some year, such that its duration is a_1 days, duration of the next month is a_2 days, and so on. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24) — the number of integers. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (28 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 31) — the numbers you are to check. -----Output----- If there are several consecutive months that fit the sequence, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes). You can print each letter in arbitrary case (small or large). -----Examples----- Input 4 31 31 30 31 Output Yes Input 2 30 30 Output No Input 5 29 31 30 31 30 Output Yes Input 3 31 28 30 Output No Input 3 31 31 28 Output Yes -----Note----- In the first example the integers can denote months July, August, September and October. In the second example the answer is no, because there are no two consecutive months each having 30 days. In the third example the months are: February (leap year) — March — April – May — June. In the fourth example the number of days in the second month is 28, so this is February. March follows February and has 31 days, but not 30, so the answer is NO. In the fifth example the months are: December — January — February (non-leap year).
