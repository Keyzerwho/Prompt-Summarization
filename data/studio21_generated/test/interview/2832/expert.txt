 Given an image, find the minimum sum of squared errors. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 256$), the number of distinct red values that occur in the original image, and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq d$), the number of distinct red values allowed in the posterized image. The remaining $d$ lines indicate the number of pixels of the image having various red values. Each such line contains two integers $r$ ($0 \leq r \leq 255$) and $p$ ($1 \leq p \leq 2^{26}$), where $r$ is a red intensity value and $p$ is the number of pixels having red intensity $r$. Those $d$ lines are given in increasing order of red value. -----Output----- Display the sum of the squared errors for an optimally chosen set of $k$ allowed integer values. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 50 20000 150 10000 Sample Output 1: 66670000 Sample Input 2: 2 2 50 20000 150 10000 Sample Output 2: 0
