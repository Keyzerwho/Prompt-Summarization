 You are given an array of unique integers. Return the minimum number of cards you need to take from the horse land to get n cards. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^9). The second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (2 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). Note, that the numbers in the sequence can coincide. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the answer to the problem.  Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 1 6 2 Output 11 Input 1 6 7 Output 14 Input 2 10 13 7 Output 36
