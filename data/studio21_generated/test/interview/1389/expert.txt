 You are given an image. The image has n pixels and m features. For each feature, you need to output the number of operations required to calculate the values of this attribute at an arbitrary image. For a better understanding of the statement, read the explanation of the first sample. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of rows and columns in the feature. Next n lines contain the description of the feature. Each line consists of m characters, the j-th character of the i-th line equals to "W", if this element of the feature is white and "B" if it is black. -----Output----- Print a single number — the minimum number of operations that you need to make to calculate the value of the feature. -----Examples----- Input 6 8 BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB BBBBBBBB WWWWWWWW WWWWWWWW WWWWWWWW Output 2 Input 3 3 WBW BWW WWW Output 4 Input 3 6 WWBBWW WWBBWW WWBBWW Output 3 Input 4 4 BBBB BBBB BBBB BBBW Output 4 -----Note----- The first sample corresponds to feature B, the one shown in the picture. The value of this feature in an image of size 6 × 8 equals to the difference of the total brightness of the pixels in the lower and upper half of the image. To calculate its value, perform the following two operations:   add the sum of pixels in the prefix rectangle with the lower right corner in the 6-th row and 8-th column with coefficient 1 to the variable value (the rectangle is indicated by a red frame); $\left. \begin{array}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline 1 & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} \\ \hline 1 & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} & {1} \\ \hline \end{array} \right.$  add the number of pixels in the prefix rectangle with the lower right corner in the 3-rd row and 8-th column with coefficient  - 2 and variable value. [Image]  Thus, all the pixels in the lower three rows of the image will be included with factor 1, and all pixels in the upper three rows of the image will be included with factor 1 - 2 =  - 1, as required.
