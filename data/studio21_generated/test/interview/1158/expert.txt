 you are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum possible number of stolen utensils. where utensils refers to the number of utensils left after the dinner. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 100, 1 \le k \le 100$)  — the number of kitchen utensils remaining after the dinner and the number of guests correspondingly. The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$)  — the types of the utensils remaining. Equal values stand for identical utensils while different values stand for different utensils. -----Output----- Output a single value — the minimum number of utensils that could be stolen by the guests. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 1 2 2 1 3 Output 1 Input 10 3 1 3 3 1 3 5 5 5 5 100 Output 14 -----Note----- In the first example it is clear that at least one utensil of type $3$ has been stolen, since there are two guests and only one such utensil. But it is also possible that every person received only one dish and there were only six utensils in total, when every person got a set $(1, 2, 3)$ of utensils. Therefore, the answer is $1$. One can show that in the second example at least $2$ dishes should have been served for every guest, so the number of utensils should be at least $24$: every set contains $4$ utensils and every one of the $3$ guests gets two such sets. Therefore, at least $14$ objects have been stolen. Please note that utensils of some types (for example, of types $2$ and $4$ in this example) may be not present in the set served for dishes.
