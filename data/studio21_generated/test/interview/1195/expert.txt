 You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input----- The first line of input data contains a single integer $n$ ($5 \le n \le 10$). The second line of input data contains $n$ space-separated integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 32$). -----Output----- Output a single integer. -----Example----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 4 -----Note----- We did not proofread this statement at all.
