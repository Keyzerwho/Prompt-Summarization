 You are given a string s, and an integer n.  Return the maximum possible total beauty of a palindrome which can be obtained by concatenating some (possibly all) of the strings s_i. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers k and n divided by space and denoting the number of Santa friends and the length of every string they've presented, respectively (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 100 000; n·k  ≤ 100 000). k lines follow. The i-th of them contains the string s_{i} and its beauty a_{i} ( - 10 000 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10 000). The string consists of n lowercase English letters, and its beauty is integer. Some of strings may coincide. Also, equal strings can have different beauties. -----Output----- In the only line print the required maximum possible beauty. -----Examples----- Input 7 3 abb 2 aaa -3 bba -1 zyz -4 abb 5 aaa 7 xyx 4 Output 12 Input 3 1 a 1 a 2 a 3 Output 6 Input 2 5 abcde 10000 abcde 10000 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example Santa can obtain abbaaaxyxaaabba by concatenating strings 5, 2, 7, 6 and 3 (in this order).
