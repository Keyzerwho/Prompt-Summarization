 There are $n$ children. Children want to stand in a circle so that the maximum difference between the growth of two neighboring children would be minimal possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$) — the number of the children who came to the cowboy Vlad's birthday. The second line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) denoting heights of every child. -----Output----- Print exactly $n$ integers — heights of the children in the order in which they should stand in a circle. You can start printing a circle with any child. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 1 1 3 2 Output 1 2 3 2 1 Input 3 30 10 20 Output 10 20 30 -----Note----- In the first example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to $1$, since the corresponding absolute differences are $1$, $1$, $1$ and $0$. Note, that sequences $[2, 3, 2, 1, 1]$ and $[3, 2, 1, 1, 2]$ form the same circles and differ only by the selection of the starting point. In the second example, the discomfort of the circle is equal to $20$, since the absolute difference of $10$ and $30$ is equal to $20$.
