 You need to find the order of courses that Polycarp should pass. 
-----Input----- The first line contains n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of online-courses and the number of main courses of Polycarp's specialty.  The second line contains k distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of main online-courses of Polycarp's specialty.  Then n lines follow, each of them describes the next course: the i-th of them corresponds to the course i. Each line starts from the integer t_{i} (0 ≤ t_{i} ≤ n - 1) — the number of courses on which the i-th depends. Then there follows the sequence of t_{i} distinct integers from 1 to n — numbers of courses in random order, on which the i-th depends. It is guaranteed that no course can depend on itself.  It is guaranteed that the sum of all values t_{i} doesn't exceed 10^5.  -----Output----- Print -1, if there is no the way to get a specialty.  Otherwise, in the first line print the integer m — the minimum number of online-courses which it is necessary to pass to get a specialty. In the second line print m distinct integers — numbers of courses which it is necessary to pass in the chronological order of their passage. If there are several answers it is allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 6 2 5 3 0 0 0 2 2 1 1 4 1 5 Output 5 1 2 3 4 5  Input 9 3 3 9 5 0 0 3 9 4 5 0 0 1 8 1 6 1 2 2 1 2 Output 6 1 2 9 4 5 3  Input 3 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 1 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first test firstly you can take courses number 1 and 2, after that you can take the course number 4, then you can take the course number 5, which is the main. After that you have to take only the course number 3, which is the last not passed main course.
