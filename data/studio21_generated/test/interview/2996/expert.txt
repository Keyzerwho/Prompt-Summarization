 You are given a list of $n$ integers. You want to sort them so $i < j$ implies there is enough time to transport the equipment used in the $i^{th}$ request to the location of the $j^{th}$ request. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) and $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100$) which are the number of requests and the number of catering teams, respectively. Following that are $n$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains $n-i+1$ integers between $0$ and $1000000$ inclusive. The $j^{th}$ number in the $i^{th}$ line is the cost of moving a set of equipment from location $i$ to location $i+j$. The company is at location $1$ and the $n$ requests are at locations $2$ to $n+1$. -----Output----- Display the minimum moving cost to service all requests. (This amount does not include the cost of moving the equipment back to the catering company.) -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 2 40 30 40 50 10 50 Sample Output: 80
