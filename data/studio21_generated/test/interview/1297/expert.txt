 You are given a string representing a DNA sequence. You need to determine the number of insertions required to make it encode a functional protein. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line, containing a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each character of s will be from the set {'A', 'T', 'G', 'C'}. This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 3 points for the correct submission. -----Output----- The program should print on one line a single integer representing the minimum number of 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C' characters that are required to be inserted into the input string in order to make all runs of identical characters have odd length. -----Examples----- Input GTTAAAG Output 1 Input AACCAACCAAAAC Output 5 -----Note----- In the first example, it is sufficient to insert a single nucleotide of any type between the two 'T's in the sequence to restore the functionality of the protein.
