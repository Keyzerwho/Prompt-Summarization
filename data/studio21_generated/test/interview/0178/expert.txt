 You are given a string $s$ of length $n$. You are given $k$ characters. At each move, you erase a character, if the resulting string is a telephone number you win. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($13 \le n < 10^5$, $n$ is odd) â€” the length of string $s$. The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting only of decimal digits. -----Output----- If Vasya has a strategy that guarantees him victory, print YES. Otherwise print NO. -----Examples----- Input 13 8380011223344 Output YES Input 15 807345619350641 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example Vasya needs to erase the second character. Then Petya cannot erase a character from the remaining string 880011223344 so that it does not become a telephone number. In the second example after Vasya's turn Petya can erase one character character 8. The resulting string can't be a telephone number, because there is no digit 8 at all.
