 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n \le 100$) — the length of the string $s$. The second line contains the string $s$ of length $n$ consisting only from zeros and ones. -----Output----- In the first line, output a single integer $k$ ($1\le k$) — a minimal number of strings you have cut $s$ into. In the second line, output $k$ strings $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k$ separated with spaces. The length of each string has to be positive. Their concatenation has to be equal to $s$ and all of them have to be good. If there are multiple answers, print any. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 1 1 Input 2 10 Output 2 1 0 Input 6 100011 Output 2 100 011 -----Note----- In the first example, the string 1 wasn't cut at all. As it is good, the condition is satisfied. In the second example, 1 and 0 both are good. As 10 isn't good, the answer is indeed minimal. In the third example, 100 and 011 both are good. As 100011 isn't good, the answer is indeed minimal.
