 Given an integer $n$, output any good permutation of length $n$. 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows. The first and only line of every test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$). -----Output----- For every test, output any good permutation of length $n$ on a separate line.  -----Example----- Input 3 1 3 7 Output 1 3 1 2 4 3 5 2 7 1 6 -----Note----- For $n = 3$, $[3,1,2]$ is a good permutation. Some of the subarrays are listed below.   $3\text{ OR }1 = 3 \geq 2$ $(i = 1,j = 2)$  $3\text{ OR }1\text{ OR }2 = 3 \geq 3$ $(i = 1,j = 3)$  $1\text{ OR }2 = 3 \geq 2$ $(i = 2,j = 3)$  $1 \geq 1$ $(i = 2,j = 2)$  Similarly, you can verify that $[4,3,5,2,7,1,6]$ is also good.
