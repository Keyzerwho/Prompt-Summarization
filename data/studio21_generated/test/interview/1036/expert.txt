 You are given 2^k non-negative integers 0 through 2^k-1.  The favorite hand of each player (R, P, or S) is represented by the ((i\text{ mod } n) + 1)-th character of s, where 0 ≤ i ≤ 2^k-1. The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players l through r-1 is determined as follows:  - If r-l=1 (that is, there is just one player), the winner is Player l.  - If r-l\geq 2, let m=(l+r)/2, and we hold two tournaments, one among Players l through m-1 and the other among Players m through r-1. Let a and b be the respective winners of these tournaments. a and b then play a match of rock paper scissors, and the winner of this match - or a if the match is drawn - is the winner of the tournament held among Players l through r-1. Find the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 2
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: n k s -----Output----- Print the favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 2^k-1, as R, P, or S. -----Sample Input----- 3 2 RPS -----Sample Output----- P  - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 1 is P.  - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 2 through 3 is R.  - The favorite hand of the winner of the tournament held among Players 0 through 3 is P. Thus, the answer is P.    P  ┌─┴─┐  P   R ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐ R P S R  ```        S    ┌───┴───┐    P       S  ┌─┴─┐   ┌─┴─┐  P   R   S   P ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐ R P S R P S R P ```
