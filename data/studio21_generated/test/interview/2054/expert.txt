 You are given 2 integer arrays of length n, array A and array B. Return the number of possible sets of 3 numbers such that (1st number in set is from array A, 2nd number in set is from array B, 3rd number in set is from array A). 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \le a, b \le 10^9$) — the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively. -----Output----- For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn. -----Example----- Input 4 4 4 1000000000 0 7 15 8 7 Output 2 0 7 5 -----Note----- In the first test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and one shovel. In the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he cannot craft anything.
