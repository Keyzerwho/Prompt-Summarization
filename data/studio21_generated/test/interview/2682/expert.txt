 Given a deck of size 2N where i-th card is labelled i, find the position of the card labelled K in the final, shuffled deck. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input file will contain one integer, Q, representing the number of Chef's questions. Each of the next Q lines will contain a pair of integers, N and K. -----Output----- The output file will contain Q lines, each one representing the answer to one of Chef's questions. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 64 - 0 ≤ K < 2N -----Subtaks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 Subtask #2 (30 points): - 1 ≤ N ≤ 32 Subtask #3 (40 points): - Original constraints -----Example----- Input: 3 3 4 3 3 3 2 Output: 1 6 2 Input: 1 64 11047805202224836936 Output: 1337369305470044825 -----Explanation----- In all questions, we have N = 3. Therefore, we have a deck with 8 cards. The shuffling is done in three steps: Step 0: We divide {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} in 20 decks. We get only one deck. The deck is reordered into {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7}. Step 1: We divide {0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7} in 21 decks. We get two decks: {0, 2, 4, 6} and {1, 3, 5, 7}. {0, 2, 4, 6} is reordered into {0, 4, 2, 6} while {1, 3, 5, 7} is reordered into {1, 5, 3, 7}. We get {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7} when we put the decks back together. Step 2: We divide {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7} in 22 decks. We get four decks: {0, 4}, {2, 6}, {1, 5} and {3, 7}. Each one of the four decks stays the same after it is reordered (as there are only two elements to reorder). We get the final, shuffled deck: {0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7}. The card labelled 4 is on position 1. The card labelled 3 is on position 6. The card labelled 2 is on position 2.
