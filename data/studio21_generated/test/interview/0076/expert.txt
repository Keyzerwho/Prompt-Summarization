 You are given a number $n$ and a value $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $m$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- The only line contains four integer numbers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^{12}$, $1 \le a, b \le 100$), where $n$ is the initial number of the commentary boxes, $m$ is the number of delegations to come, $a$ is the fee to build a box and $b$ is the fee to demolish a box. -----Output----- Output the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by $m$). It is allowed that the final number of the boxes is equal to $0$. -----Examples----- Input 9 7 3 8 Output 15 Input 2 7 3 7 Output 14 Input 30 6 17 19 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example organizers can build $5$ boxes to make the total of $14$ paying $3$ burles for the each of them. In the second example organizers can demolish $2$ boxes to make the total of $0$ paying $7$ burles for the each of them. In the third example organizers are already able to distribute all the boxes equally among the delegations, each one get $5$ boxes.
