 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of training sessions. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10 000) — the number of teams that will be present on each of the days. -----Output----- If there is a way to order pizzas using only coupons and discounts and do not buy any extra pizzas on any of the days, then print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of output. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 1 2 Output YES Input 3 1 0 1 Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample, Sereja can use one coupon to buy one pizza on the first and the second days, one coupon to buy pizza on the second and the third days and one discount to buy pizzas on the fourth days. This is the only way to order pizzas for this sample. In the second sample, Sereja can't use neither the coupon nor the discount without ordering an extra pizza. Note, that it's possible that there will be no teams attending the training sessions on some days.
