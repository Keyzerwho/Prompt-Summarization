 You are given an array of integers. You need to find the number of roubles you have to spend to buy at least L liters of lemonade. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the costs of bottles of different types. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade. -----Examples----- Input 4 12 20 30 70 90 Output 150 Input 4 3 10000 1000 100 10 Output 10 Input 4 3 10 100 1000 10000 Output 30 Input 5 787787787 123456789 234567890 345678901 456789012 987654321 Output 44981600785557577 -----Note----- In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles. In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles. In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
