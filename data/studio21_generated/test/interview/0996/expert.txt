 A super computer has been built in the Turtle Academy of Sciences. The computer consists of n m k CPUs. The architecture was the paralellepiped of size n   m   k, split into 1   1   1 cells, each cell contains exactly one CPU. Thus, each CPU can be simultaneously identified as a group of three numbers from the layer number from 1 to n, the line number from 1 to m and the column number from 1 to k. In the process of the Super Computer's work the CPUs can send each other messages by the famous turtle scheme: CPU (x, y, z) can send messages to CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and (x, y, z + 1) (of course, if they exist), there is no feedback, that is, CPUs (x + 1, y, z), (x, y + 1, z) and 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100) — the dimensions of the Super Computer.  Then n blocks follow, describing the current state of the processes. The blocks correspond to the layers of the Super Computer in the order from 1 to n. Each block consists of m lines, k characters in each — the description of a layer in the format of an m × k table. Thus, the state of the CPU (x, y, z) is corresponded to the z-th character of the y-th line of the block number x. Character "1" corresponds to a working CPU and character "0" corresponds to a malfunctioning one. The blocks are separated by exactly one empty line. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of critical CPUs, that is, such that turning only this CPU off will disrupt some control. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 3 000 000 111 111 Output 2 Input 3 3 3 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 111 Output 19 Input 1 1 10 0101010101 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample the whole first layer of CPUs is malfunctional. In the second layer when CPU (2, 1, 2) turns off, it disrupts the control by CPU (2, 1, 3) over CPU (2, 1, 1), and when CPU (2, 2, 2) is turned off, it disrupts the control over CPU (2, 2, 3) by CPU (2, 2, 1). In the second sample all processors except for the corner ones are critical. In the third sample there is not a single processor controlling another processor, so the answer is 0.
