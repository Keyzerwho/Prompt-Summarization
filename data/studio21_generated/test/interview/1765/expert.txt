 You are given a sequence of positive integers. You need to find which numbers should be written out so that the beauty of the written out numbers is maximum. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- In the first line print a single integer k (k > 0), showing how many numbers to write out. In the second line print k integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k} — the numbers to write out. You are allowed to print numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{k} in any order, but all of them must be distinct. If there are multiple ways to write out the numbers, choose the one with the maximum number of numbers to write out. If there still are multiple ways, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 2 4 5 Input 3 1 2 4 Output 1 4
