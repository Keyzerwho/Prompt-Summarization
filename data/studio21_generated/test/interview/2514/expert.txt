 Given N positive integers A, you successively do the following Q operations:  - In the i-th operation, you replace every element whose value is B with C. For each i (1 \leq i \leq Q), find S: the sum of all elements in A just after the i-th operation.  Output S modulo 10^9. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_{1} A_{2} \cdots A_{N} Q B_{1} C_{1} B_{2} C_{2} \vdots B_{Q} C_{Q} -----Output----- Print Q integers S_{i} to Standard Output in the following format: S_{1} S_{2} \vdots S_{Q} Note that S_{i} may not fit into a 32-bit integer. -----Sample Input----- 4 1 2 3 4 3 1 2 3 4 2 4 -----Sample Output----- 11 12 16 Initially, the sequence A is 1,2,3,4. After each operation, it becomes the following:  - 2, 2, 3, 4  - 2, 2, 4, 4  - 4, 4, 4, 4
