 You are given n friends, each of height h. You want to walk them in row such that their height does not exceed h. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and h (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ h ≤ 1000) — the number of friends and the height of the fence, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2h), the i-th of them is equal to the height of the i-th person. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum possible valid width of the road. -----Examples----- Input 3 7 4 5 14 Output 4 Input 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 6 Input 6 5 7 6 8 9 10 5 Output 11 -----Note----- In the first sample, only person number 3 must bend down, so the required width is equal to 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. In the second sample, all friends are short enough and no one has to bend, so the width 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 is enough. In the third sample, all the persons have to bend, except the last one. The required minimum width of the road is equal to 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11.
