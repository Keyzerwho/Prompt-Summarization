 You are given an array p of integers. Find such permutation q that q^2 = p. If there are several such q find any of them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of elements in permutation p. The second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the elements of permutation p. -----Output----- If there is no permutation q such that q^2 = p print the number "-1". If the answer exists print it. The only line should contain n different integers q_{i} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ n) — the elements of the permutation q. If there are several solutions print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 1 4 3 Output 3 4 2 1 Input 4 2 1 3 4 Output -1 Input 5 2 3 4 5 1 Output 4 5 1 2 3
