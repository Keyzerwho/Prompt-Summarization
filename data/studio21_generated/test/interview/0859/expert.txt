 You are given a list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the probability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final by Drazil's commands 
-----Input----- The first line contains a string s_1 — the commands Drazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-'}.  The second line contains a string s_2 — the commands Dreamoon's smartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-', '?'}. '?' denotes an unrecognized command. Lengths of two strings are equal and do not exceed 10. -----Output----- Output a single real number corresponding to the probability. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 9}. -----Examples----- Input ++-+- +-+-+ Output 1.000000000000 Input +-+- +-?? Output 0.500000000000 Input +++ ??- Output 0.000000000000 -----Note----- For the first sample, both s_1 and s_2 will lead Dreamoon to finish at the same position  + 1.  For the second sample, s_1 will lead Dreamoon to finish at position 0, while there are four possibilites for s_2: {"+-++", "+-+-", "+--+", "+---"} with ending position {+2, 0, 0, -2} respectively. So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of finishing at the correct position is 0.5.  For the third sample, s_2 could only lead us to finish at positions {+1, -1, -3}, so the probability to finish at the correct position  + 3 is 0.
