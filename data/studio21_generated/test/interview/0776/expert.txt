 You are given a number M and limit N. You need to output the number of mouses which can be bought for M$M$ and at most N$N$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers a, b and c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^5)  — the number of computers that only have USB ports, the number of computers, that only have PS/2 ports, and the number of computers, that have both options, respectively. The next line contains one integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ 3·10^5)  — the number of mouses in the price list. The next m lines each describe another mouse. The i-th line contains first integer val_{i} (1 ≤ val_{i} ≤ 10^9)  — the cost of the i-th mouse, then the type of port (USB or PS/2) that is required to plug the mouse in. -----Output----- Output two integers separated by space — the number of equipped computers and the total cost of the mouses you will buy. -----Example----- Input 2 1 1 4 5 USB 6 PS/2 3 PS/2 7 PS/2 Output 3 14 -----Note----- In the first example you can buy the first three mouses. This way you will equip one of the computers that has only a USB port with a USB mouse, and the two PS/2 mouses you will plug into the computer with PS/2 port and the computer with both ports.
