 You are given an array arr. Find and return any set S, that satisfies the following conditions:  the elements of S are distinct integers from 1 to limit;  the value of $\sum_{x \in S} \text{lowbit}(x)$ is equal to sum. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers: sum, limit (1 ≤ sum, limit ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- In the first line print an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), denoting the size of S. Then print the elements of set S in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If it's impossible to find a suitable set, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 Output 2 4 5 Input 4 3 Output 3 2 3 1 Input 5 1 Output -1 -----Note----- In sample test 1: lowbit(4) = 4, lowbit(5) = 1, 4 + 1 = 5. In sample test 2: lowbit(1) = 1, lowbit(2) = 2, lowbit(3) = 1, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.
