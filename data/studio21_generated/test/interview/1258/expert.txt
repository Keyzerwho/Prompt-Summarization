 You are given an array $q$ of triples $q_i = (p_i, p_{i+1}, p_{i+2})$, where $1 \le i \le n-2$. You are also given an array $p$ of $n$ integers. $p$ must be a permutation of $1, 2, \dots, n$. You are required to return the permutation $p$ that is consistent with $q$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($5 \le n \le 10^5$) — the size of permutation $p$. The $i$-th of the next $n-2$ lines contains $3$ integers $q_{i, 1}$, $q_{i, 2}$, $q_{i, 3}$ ($1 \le q_{i, j} \le n$) — the elements of the $i$-th triple of the rearranged (shuffled) array $q_i$, in random order. Remember, that the numbers within each triple can be rearranged and also the positions of the triples can be rearranged. It is guaranteed that there is at least one permutation $p$ that is consistent with the input.  -----Output----- Print $n$ distinct integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$) such that $p$ is consistent with array $q$.  If there are multiple answers, print any.  -----Example----- Input 5 4 3 2 2 3 5 4 1 2 Output 1 4 2 3 5
