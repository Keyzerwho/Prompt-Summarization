 Given an array $a$, an integer $k$ and a constant $m$, split the array $a$ into exactly $k$ subarrays such that:   Each element from $a$ belongs to exactly one subarray.  Each subarray has at least $m$ elements.  The sum of all beauties of $k$ subarrays is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le m$, $2 \le k$, $m \cdot k \le n$) — the number of elements in $a$, the constant $m$ in the definition of beauty and the number of subarrays to split to. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$). -----Output----- In the first line, print the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the subarrays in the optimal partition. In the second line, print $k-1$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{k-1}$ ($1 \le p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_{k-1} < n$) representing the partition of the array, in which:  All elements with indices from $1$ to $p_1$ belong to the first subarray.  All elements with indices from $p_1 + 1$ to $p_2$ belong to the second subarray.  $\ldots$.  All elements with indices from $p_{k-1} + 1$ to $n$ belong to the last, $k$-th subarray. If there are several optimal partitions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 9 2 3 5 2 5 2 4 1 1 3 2 Output 21 3 5  Input 6 1 4 4 1 3 2 2 3 Output 12 1 3 5  Input 2 1 2 -1000000000 1000000000 Output 0 1  -----Note----- In the first example, one of the optimal partitions is $[5, 2, 5]$, $[2, 4]$, $[1, 1, 3, 2]$.   The beauty of the subarray $[5, 2, 5]$ is $5 + 5 = 10$.  The beauty of the subarray $[2, 4]$ is $2 + 4 = 6$.  The beauty of the subarray $[1, 1, 3, 2]$ is $3 + 2 = 5$.  The sum of their beauties is $10 + 6 + 5 = 21$. In the second example, one optimal partition is $[4]$, $[1, 3]$, $[2, 2]$, $[3]$.
