 Given a two-dimensional coordinate system, you are given:   y_1, y_2   the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w}   the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b}   the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r   the radius of the ball.  A goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r. 
-----Input----- The first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 ≤ y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} ≤ 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2·r < y_2 - y_1). It is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners. -----Output----- If Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} — the abscissa of his point of aiming.  If there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them. When checking the correctness of the answer, all comparisons are made with the permissible absolute error, equal to 10^{ - 8}.  It is recommended to print as many characters after the decimal point as possible. -----Examples----- Input 4 10 13 10 3 1 Output 4.3750000000 Input 1 4 6 2 2 1 Output -1 Input 3 10 15 17 9 2 Output 11.3333333333 -----Note----- Note that in the first and third samples other correct values of abscissa x_{w} are also possible.
