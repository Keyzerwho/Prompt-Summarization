 You are given an array consisting of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two maximum possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the maximum possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of records in the system log. Next follow n events from the system journal in the order in which the were made. Each event was written on a single line and looks as "+ r_{i}" or "- r_{i}", where r_{i} is an integer from 1 to 10^6, the registration number of the visitor (that is, distinct visitors always have distinct registration numbers). It is guaranteed that the log is not contradictory, that is, for every visitor the types of any of his two consecutive events are distinct. Before starting the system, and after stopping the room may possibly contain visitors. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum possible capacity of the reading room. -----Examples----- Input 6 + 12001 - 12001 - 1 - 1200 + 1 + 7 Output 3 Input 2 - 1 - 2 Output 2 Input 2 + 1 - 1 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first sample test, the system log will ensure that at some point in the reading room were visitors with registration numbers 1, 1200 and 12001. More people were not in the room at the same time based on the log. Therefore, the answer to the test is 3.
