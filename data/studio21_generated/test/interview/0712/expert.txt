 You are given an escalator with an infinite length. Your task is to count the expected value of the number of people standing on the escalator after t seconds. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three numbers n, p, t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 2000, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1). Numbers n and t are integers, number p is real, given with exactly two digits after the decimal point. -----Output----- Print a single real number — the expected number of people who will be standing on the escalator after t seconds. The absolute or relative error mustn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 1 0.50 1 Output 0.5 Input 1 0.50 4 Output 0.9375 Input 4 0.20 2 Output 0.4
