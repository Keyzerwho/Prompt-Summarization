 Given two strings a and b, find the length of their longest uncommon subsequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains string a, and the second line — string b. Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger than 10^5 characters. -----Output----- If there's no uncommon subsequence, print "-1". Otherwise print the length of the longest uncommon subsequence of a and b. -----Examples----- Input abcd defgh Output 5 Input a a Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example: you can choose "defgh" from string b as it is the longest subsequence of string b that doesn't appear as a subsequence of string a.
