 You are given an array of integers. Return the number of settlements that may contain the book  
-----Input----- The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and d (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100000; 0 ≤ d ≤ n - 1). The second line contains m distinct space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n). Then n - 1 lines follow, each line describes a path made in the area. A path is described by a pair of space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} representing the ends of this path. -----Output----- Print a single number — the number of settlements that may contain the Book of Evil. It is possible that Manao received some controversial information and there is no settlement that may contain the Book. In such case, print 0. -----Examples----- Input 6 2 3 1 2 1 5 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 Output 3 -----Note----- Sample 1. The damage range of the Book of Evil equals 3 and its effects have been noticed in settlements 1 and 2. Thus, it can be in settlements 3, 4 or 5.  [Image]
