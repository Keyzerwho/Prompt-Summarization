 Students in a dormitory have a shower. Each student has a happiness value. Students talk in pairs, and the total happiness of all students is the maximum. 
-----Input----- The input consists of five lines, each line contains five space-separated integers: the j-th number in the i-th line shows g_{ij} (0 ≤ g_{ij} ≤ 10^5). It is guaranteed that g_{ii} = 0 for all i. Assume that the students are numbered from 1 to 5. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum possible total happiness of the students. -----Examples----- Input 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 Output 32 Input 0 43 21 18 2 3 0 21 11 65 5 2 0 1 4 54 62 12 0 99 87 64 81 33 0 Output 620 -----Note----- In the first sample, the optimal arrangement of the line is 23154. In this case, the total happiness equals: (g_23 + g_32 + g_15 + g_51) + (g_13 + g_31 + g_54 + g_45) + (g_15 + g_51) + (g_54 + g_45) = 32.
