 You are given a non-empty string and an integer k, indicating the number of folds. Your task is to find the highest pile of identical letters that you can build using fold operations on a given word. Note that you can fold as many times as you want. 
-----Input----- The input will consist of one line containing a single string of n characters with 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000 and no spaces. All characters of the string will be uppercase letters. This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 5 points for the correct submission. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the size of the largest pile composed of identical characters that can be seen in a valid result of folding operations on the given string. -----Examples----- Input ABRACADABRA Output 3 Input ABBBCBDB Output 3 Input AB Output 1 -----Note----- Consider the first example. Manao can create a pile of three 'A's using the folding "AB|RACAD|ABRA", which results in the following structure:  ABRA DACAR    AB In the second example, Manao can create a pile of three 'B's using the following folding: "AB|BB|CBDB".  CBDB BB AB Another way for Manao to create a pile of three 'B's with "ABBBCBDB" is the following folding: "AB|B|BCBDB".   BCBDB  B AB In the third example, there are no folds performed and the string is just written in one line.
