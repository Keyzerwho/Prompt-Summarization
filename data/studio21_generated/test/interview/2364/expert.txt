 Leha is planning his journey from Moscow to Saratov. He hates trains, so he has decided to get from one city to another by car. The path from Moscow to Saratov can be represented as a straight line, and the distance between Moscow and Saratov is $n$ km. Let's say that Moscow is situated at the point with coordinate $0$ km, and Saratov   at coordinate $n$ km. Driving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha has already covered $i$ kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he considers the difficulty of covering $(i + 1)$-th kilometer as $a_{i + 1}$. It is guaranteed that for every $i \in [1, n - 1]$ $a_i \le a_{i + 1}$. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of difficulties of each kilometer in the journey. Fortunately, there may be some rest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from $1$ to $n - 1$ may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have a rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty $a_1$,
-----Input----- The first line contains one number $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the distance from Moscow to Saratov. The second line contains $n$ integer numbers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_n \le 10^6$), where $a_i$ is the difficulty of $i$-th kilometer after Leha has rested. -----Output----- Print one number — $p \cdot 2^{n - 1}$, taken modulo $998244353$. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 Output 5 Input 4 1 3 3 7 Output 60
