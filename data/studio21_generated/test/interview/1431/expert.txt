 There are N boxes arranged in a row from left to right. Each box has an integer number written on it. Snuke can choose to put a ball or not in each box. If Snuke puts a ball on box i, the total number of balls in the boxes with numbers i, 2i, 3i, 4i, ..., 2n + 1i, is congruent to 2i mod 2. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N a_1 a_2 ... a_N -----Output----- If a good set of choices does not exist, print -1. If a good set of choices exists, print one such set of choices in the following format: M b_1 b_2 ... b_M where M denotes the number of boxes that will contain a ball, and b_1,\ b_2,\ ...,\ b_M are the integers written on these boxes, in any order. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 0 0 -----Sample Output----- 1 1 Consider putting a ball only in the box with 1 written on it.  - There are three boxes with multiples of 1 written on them: the boxes with 1, 2, and 3. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 1.  - There is only one box with a multiple of 2 written on it: the box with 2. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 0.  - There is only one box with a multiple of 3 written on it: the box with 3. The total number of balls contained in these boxes is 0. Thus, the condition is satisfied, so this set of choices is good.
