 Arkady wants to choose a continuous subsegment of sushi that has equal number of sushi of each type and each half of the subsegment has only sushi of one type. For example, subsegment $[2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1]$ is valid, but subsegment $[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]$ is not, because both halves contain both types of sushi. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100\,000$) — the number of pieces of sushi. The second line contains $n$ integers $t_1$, $t_2$, ..., $t_n$ ($t_i = 1$, denoting a sushi with tuna or $t_i = 2$, denoting a sushi with eel), representing the types of sushi from left to right. It is guaranteed that there is at least one piece of sushi of each type. Note that it means that there is at least one valid continuous segment. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum length of a valid continuous segment. -----Examples----- Input 7 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 Output 4 Input 6 1 2 1 2 1 2 Output 2 Input 9 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first example Arkady can choose the subsegment $[2, 2, 1, 1]$ or the subsegment $[1, 1, 2, 2]$ with length $4$. In the second example there is no way but to choose one of the subsegments $[2, 1]$ or $[1, 2]$ with length $2$. In the third example Arkady's best choice is the subsegment $[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]$.
