 You are given an integer C and a string S. Takahashi will choose his workdays as follows:  - After working for a day, he will refrain from working on the subsequent C days.  - If the i-th character of S is x, he will not work on Day i, where Day 1 is tomorrow, Day 2 is the day after tomorrow, and so on. Find all days on which Takahashi is bound to work.
