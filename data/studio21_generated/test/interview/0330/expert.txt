 You are given y branches numbered from 2 to y and grasshoppers numbered from 2 to p, and your goal is to find the highest branch that cannot be reached by any of the grasshoppers or report that it's impossible. 
-----Input----- The only line contains two integers p and y (2 ≤ p ≤ y ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Output the number of the highest suitable branch. If there are none, print -1 instead. -----Examples----- Input 3 6 Output 5 Input 3 4 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample case grasshopper from branch 2 reaches branches 2, 4 and 6 while branch 3 is initially settled by another grasshopper. Therefore the answer is 5. It immediately follows that there are no valid branches in second sample case.
