 You are given an array containing information about the order of guests who entered the castle. You are also given k numbers denoting the number of guards in the castle. Find the minimum number of guards in the castle that should have been on duty in order to prevent any uninvited guest from sneaking in. 
-----Input----- Two integers are given in the first string: the number of guests n and the number of guards k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26). In the second string, n uppercase English letters s_1s_2... s_{n} are given, where s_{i} is the entrance used by the i-th guest. -----Output----- Output «YES» if at least one door was unguarded during some time, and «NO» otherwise. You can output each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 5 1 AABBB Output NO Input 5 1 ABABB Output YES -----Note----- In the first sample case, the door A is opened right before the first guest's arrival and closed when the second guest enters the castle. The door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed after the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one is closed before the second one is opened. In the second sample case, the door B is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave the door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the castle through this door.
