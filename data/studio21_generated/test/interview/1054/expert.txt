 You are given a map with mines. You need to build the city in such a way that all the mines are inside or on the border of the city square. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains number n — the number of mines on the map (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines contains a pair of integers x_{i} and y_{i} — the coordinates of the corresponding mine ( - 10^9 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 10^9). All points are pairwise distinct. -----Output----- Print the minimum area of the city that can cover all the mines with valuable resources. -----Examples----- Input 2 0 0 2 2 Output 4 Input 2 0 0 0 3 Output 9
