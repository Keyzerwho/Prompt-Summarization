 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the length of the Morse-like code. 
-----Input----- The single line of input contains a string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 32000$) of upper-case or lower-case letters, spaces, commas, periods, exclamation points, and/or question marks. Everything but the letters should be ignored. The line will contain at least one letter. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the length of $s$ when encoded with an optimal reassignment of the sequences of Morse Code. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: ICPC Sample Output 1: 17 Sample Input 2: A Sample Output 2: 1
