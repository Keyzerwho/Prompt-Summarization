 You are given n integers from 1 to 10^9. Determine the k-th identifier to be pronounced. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(2·10^9, n·(n + 1) / 2). The second line contains the sequence id_1, id_2, ..., id_{n} (1 ≤ id_{i} ≤ 10^9) — identifiers of roborts. It is guaranteed that all identifiers are different. -----Output----- Print the k-th pronounced identifier (assume that the numeration starts from 1). -----Examples----- Input 2 2 1 2 Output 1 Input 4 5 10 4 18 3 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample identifiers of robots will be pronounced in the following order: 1, 1, 2. As k = 2, the answer equals to 1. In the second test case identifiers of robots will be pronounced in the following order: 10, 10, 4, 10, 4, 18, 10, 4, 18, 3. As k = 5, the answer equals to 4.
