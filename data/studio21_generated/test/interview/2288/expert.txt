 The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 100)$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 500)$ — the size of the arrays. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^5)$  — the value of the $i$-th element. The third line containts $n$ integers $b_i$ $(b_i \in \{0, 1\})$  — the type of the $i$-th element. -----Output----- For each test case, print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes) depending on whether it is possible to sort elements in non-decreasing order of their value. You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Example----- Input 5 4 10 20 20 30 0 1 0 1 3 3 1 2 0 1 1 4 2 2 4 8 1 1 1 1 3 5 15 4 0 0 0 4 20 10 100 50 1 0 0 1 Output Yes Yes Yes No Yes -----Note----- For the first case: The elements are already in sorted order. For the second case: Ashish may first swap elements at positions $1$ and $2$, then swap elements at positions $2$ and $3$. For the third case: The elements are already in sorted order. For the fourth case: No swap operations may be performed as there is no pair of elements $i$ and $j$ such that $b_i \ne b_j$. The elements cannot be sorted. For the fifth case: Ashish may swap elements at positions $3$ and $4$, then elements at positions $1$ and $2$.
