 You are given N pairs of socks. You need to find the number of pairs of socks that were on the table at the same time. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of sock pairs. The second line contains 2n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_2n (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n), which describe the order in which Andryusha took the socks from the bag. More precisely, x_{i} means that the i-th sock Andryusha took out was from pair x_{i}. It is guaranteed that Andryusha took exactly two socks of each pair. -----Output----- Print single integer — the maximum number of socks that were on the table at the same time. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 2 1 1 3 2 3 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example Andryusha took a sock from the first pair and put it on the table. Then he took the next sock which is from the first pair as well, so he immediately puts both socks to the wardrobe. Thus, at most one sock was on the table at the same time. In the second example Andryusha behaved as follows:   Initially the table was empty, he took out a sock from pair 2 and put it on the table.  Sock (2) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 1 and put it on the table.  Socks (1, 2) were on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 1, and put this pair into the wardrobe.  Sock (2) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 3 and put it on the table.  Socks (2, 3) were on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 2, and put this pair into the wardrobe.  Sock (3) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 3 and put this pair into the wardrobe.  Thus, at most two socks were on the table at the same time.
