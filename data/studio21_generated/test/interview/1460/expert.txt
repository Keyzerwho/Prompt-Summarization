 You are given an array of integers. Find the number of cells with all gray neighbours. 
-----Input----- The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 500$) — the number of gray cells with all gray neighbours in a beautiful picture. -----Output----- In the first line, print a single integer $k$ — the number of gray cells in your picture. For technical reasons, $k$ should not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$. Each of the following $k$ lines should contain two integers — coordinates of a gray cell in your picture. All listed cells should be distinct, and the picture should satisdfy all the properties listed above. All coordinates should not exceed $10^9$ by absolute value. One can show that there exists an answer satisfying all requirements with a small enough $k$. -----Example----- Input 4 Output 12 1 0 2 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 0 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 -----Note----- The answer for the sample is pictured below:  [Image]
