 you are given n points, each with a non-negative number written on it. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100000), the number of points along the circle. The following line contains a string s with exactly n digits, indicating the numbers initially present at each of the points, in clockwise order. -----Output----- Print "YES" (without quotes) if there is some sequence of operations that results in all numbers being 0, otherwise "NO" (without quotes). You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 30 000100000100000110000000001100 Output YES Input 6 314159 Output NO -----Note----- If we label the points from 1 to n, then for the first test case we can set k = 1. Then we increase the numbers at points 7 and 22 by 1, then decrease the numbers at points 7, 17, and 27 by 1, then decrease the numbers at points 4, 10, 16, 22, and 28 by 1.
