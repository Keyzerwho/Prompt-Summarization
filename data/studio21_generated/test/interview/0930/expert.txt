 You are given n rooms and k. You are given an array of integers. Find the number of combinations of number of people in the n rooms are possible  Find the count modulo (10^9 + 7). 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: n k -----Output----- Print the number of possible combinations of numbers of people in the n rooms now, modulo (10^9 + 7). -----Sample Input----- 3 2 -----Sample Output----- 10 Let c_1, c_2, and c_3 be the number of people in Room 1, 2, and 3 now, respectively. There are 10 possible combination of (c_1, c_2, c_3):  - (0, 0, 3)  - (0, 1, 2)  - (0, 2, 1)  - (0, 3, 0)  - (1, 0, 2)  - (1, 1, 1)  - (1, 2, 0)  - (2, 0, 1)  - (2, 1, 0)  - (3, 0, 0) For example, (c_1, c_2, c_3) will be (0, 1, 2) if the person in Room 1 goes to Room 2 and then one of the persons in Room 2 goes to Room 3.
