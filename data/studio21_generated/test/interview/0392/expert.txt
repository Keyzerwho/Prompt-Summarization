 You are given a number $n$ and a value $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $m$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains one integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^12). -----Output----- Print the answer in one line. -----Examples----- Input 10 Output 10 Input 12 Output 6 -----Note----- In first sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 5 and 10 in the shop. 10 isn't divisible by any perfect square, so 10 is lovely. In second sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 in the shop. 12 is divisible by 4 = 2^2, so 12 is not lovely, while 6 is indeed lovely.
