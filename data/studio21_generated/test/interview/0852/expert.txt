 You are given $n$ integers $d_i$ ($1 \le i \le n$). Koa wants to know whether she can go from the shore to the island. Help her! 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$)  — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $k$ and $l$ ($1 \le n \le 100; 1 \le k \le 100; 1 \le l \le 100$) — the number of meters of sea Koa measured and parameters $k$ and $l$. The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n$ ($0 \le d_i \le 100$)  — the depths of each meter of sea Koa measured. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $100$. -----Output----- For each test case: Print Yes if Koa can get from the shore to the island, and No otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Example----- Input 7 2 1 1 1 0 5 2 3 1 2 3 2 2 4 3 4 0 2 4 3 2 3 5 3 0 7 2 3 3 0 2 1 3 0 1 7 1 4 4 4 3 0 2 4 2 5 2 3 1 2 3 2 2 Output Yes No Yes Yes Yes No No -----Note----- In the following $s$ denotes the shore, $i$ denotes the island, $x$ denotes distance from Koa to the shore, the underline denotes the position of Koa, and values in the array below denote current depths, affected by tide, at $1, 2, \dots, n$ meters from the shore. In test case $1$ we have $n = 2, k = 1, l = 1, p = [ 0, 1 ]$. Koa wants to go from shore (at $x = 0$) to the island (at $x = 3$). Let's describe a possible solution:   Initially at $t = 0$ the beach looks like this: $[\underline{s}, 1, 0, i]$.  At $t = 0$ if Koa would decide to swim to $x = 1$, beach would look like: $[s, \underline{2}, 1, i]$ at $t = 1$, since $2 > 1$ she would drown. So Koa waits $1$ second instead and beach looks like $[\underline{s}, 2, 1, i]$ at $t = 1$.  At $t = 1$ Koa swims to $x = 1$, beach looks like $[s, \underline{1}, 0, i]$ at $t = 2$. Koa doesn't drown because $1 \le 1$.  At $t = 2$ Koa swims to $x = 2$, beach looks like $[s, 2, \underline{1}, i]$ at $t = 3$. Koa doesn't drown because $1 \le 1$.  At $t = 3$ Koa swims to $x = 3$, beach looks like $[s, 1, 0, \underline{i}]$ at $t = 4$.  At $t = 4$ Koa is at $x = 3$ and she made it!  We can show that in test case $2$ Koa can't get to the island.
