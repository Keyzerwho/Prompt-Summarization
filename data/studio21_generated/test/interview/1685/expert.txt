 You are given a complete binary tree. You have to print all paths starting from a given vertex. For example, if u = 4 and s =  UURL , then print 10. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, q ≥ 1). n is such that n + 1 is a power of 2. The next 2q lines represent queries; each query consists of two consecutive lines. The first of these two lines contains u_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i} ≤ n), the second contains non-empty string s_{i}. s_{i} doesn't contain any characters other than 'L', 'R' and 'U'. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of s_{i} (for each i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ q) doesn't exceed 10^5. -----Output----- Print q numbers, i-th number must be the answer to the i-th query. -----Example----- Input 15 2 4 UURL 8 LRLLLLLLLL Output 10 5
