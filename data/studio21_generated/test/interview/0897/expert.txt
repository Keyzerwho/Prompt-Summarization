 You are given two non-empty words of equal length. Find the probability that they are different. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n,  m ≤ 10^5) — the length of each of the two words and the size of the alphabet $\sum$, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ m) — the symbols of S_1. If a_{i} = 0, then the symbol at position i was erased. The third line contains n integers representing S_2 with the same format as S_1. -----Output----- Print the value $P \cdot Q^{-1} \operatorname{mod}(10^{9} + 7)$, where P and Q are coprime and $P / Q$ is the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 0 1 Output 500000004 Input 1 2 1 0 Output 0 Input 7 26 0 15 12 9 13 0 14 11 1 0 13 15 12 0 Output 230769233 -----Note----- In the first sample, the first word can be converted into (1) or (2). The second option is the only one that will make it lexicographically larger than the second word. So, the answer to the problem will be $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{mod}(10^{9} + 7)$, that is 500000004, because $(500000004 \cdot 2) \operatorname{mod}(10^{9} + 7) = 1$. In the second example, there is no replacement for the zero in the second word that will make the first one lexicographically larger. So, the answer to the problem is $\frac{0}{1} \operatorname{mod}(10^{9} + 7)$, that is 0.
