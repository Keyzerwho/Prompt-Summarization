 you are given a set of words. Find any partition of the set of words into subsets U_1, U_2, ..., U_{k} so that the secret is safe. Otherwise indicate that there's no such partition. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line which contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of words in the secret and the number of the Keepers. The numbers are separated by a single space. -----Output----- If there is no way to keep the secret safe, print a single integer "-1" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print n integers, the i-th of them representing the number of the Keeper who's got the i-th word of the secret. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 11 3 Output 3 1 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 3 1 Input 5 2 Output -1
