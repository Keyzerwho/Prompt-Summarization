 You are given n, k and four distinct cities a, b, c, d, can you find possible paths (v_1, ..., v_{n}) and (u_1, ..., u_{n}) to satisfy all the given conditions? 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (4 ≤ n ≤ 1000, n - 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n - 2) — the number of cities and the maximum allowed number of roads, respectively. The second line contains four distinct integers a, b, c and d (1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ n). -----Output----- Print -1 if it's impossible to satisfy all the given conditions. Otherwise, print two lines with paths descriptions. The first of these two lines should contain n distinct integers v_1, v_2, ..., v_{n} where v_1 = a and v_{n} = b. The second line should contain n distinct integers u_1, u_2, ..., u_{n} where u_1 = c and u_{n} = d. Two paths generate at most 2n - 2 roads: (v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), ..., (v_{n} - 1, v_{n}), (u_1, u_2), (u_2, u_3), ..., (u_{n} - 1, u_{n}). Your answer will be considered wrong if contains more than k distinct roads or any other condition breaks. Note that (x, y) and (y, x) are the same road. -----Examples----- Input 7 11 2 4 7 3 Output 2 7 1 3 6 5 4 7 1 5 4 6 2 3 Input 1000 999 10 20 30 40 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample test, there should be 7 cities and at most 11 roads. The provided sample solution generates 10 roads, as in the drawing. You can also see a simple path of length n between 2 and 4, and a path between 7 and 3.  [Image]
