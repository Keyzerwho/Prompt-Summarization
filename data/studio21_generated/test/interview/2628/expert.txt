 You are given an integer n. Print the gray code sequence where two successive values differ in only one bit. 
Example 1: Input: 2 Output: [0,1,3,2] Explanation: 00 - 0 01 - 1 11 - 3 10 - 2 For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined. For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence. 00 - 0 10 - 2 11 - 3 01 - 1 Example 2: Input: 0 Output: [0] Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.              A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.              Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].
