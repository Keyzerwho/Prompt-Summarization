 You are given 2n blocks, each of them has the shape of a cuboid. Each block has the bottom base of a 1   1 meter square. Among the blocks, exactly two of them have the height of one meter, exactly two have the height of two meters, ..., exactly two have the height of n meters. The blocks are arranged in a row without spacing one after the other. Of course, not every arrangement of blocks has the form of a mausoleum. In order to make the given arrangement in the form of the mausoleum, it is necessary that when you pass along the mausoleum, from one end to the other, the heights of the blocks first were non-decreasing (i.e., increasing or remained the same), and then   non-increasing (decrease or remained unchanged). It is possible that any of these two areas will be omitted. For example, the following sequences of block height meet this requirement:   [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1];  [1, 1];  [2, 2, 1, 1];  [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 35, 0 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of pairs of blocks and the number of additional requirements. Next k lines contain listed additional requirements, one per line in the format "x_{i} sign_{i} y_{i}" (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 2n), and the sign is on of the list of the five possible signs. -----Output----- Print the sought number of ways. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 Output 9 Input 3 1 2 > 3 Output 1 Input 4 1 3 = 6 Output 3
