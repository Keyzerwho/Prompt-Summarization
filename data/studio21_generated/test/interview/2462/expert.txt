 Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that: Every song is played at least once A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.   
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain test cases — one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number Flint guessed. -----Output----- For each test case print:   YES and $4$ different positive integers such that at least $3$ of them are nearly prime and their sum is equal to $n$ (if there are multiple answers print any of them);  NO if there is no way to represent $n$ as the sum of $4$ different positive integers where at least $3$ of them are nearly prime.  You can print each character of YES or NO in any case. -----Example----- Input 7 7 23 31 36 44 100 258 Output NO NO YES 14 10 6 1 YES 5 6 10 15 YES 6 7 10 21 YES 2 10 33 55 YES 10 21 221 6 -----Note----- In the first and second test cases, it can be proven that there are no four different positive integers such that at least three of them are nearly prime. In the third test case, $n=31=2 \cdot 7 + 2 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1$: integers $14$, $10$, $6$ are nearly prime. In the fourth test case, $n=36=5 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 5$: integers $6$, $10$, $15$ are nearly prime. In the fifth test case, $n=44=2 \cdot 3 + 7 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 7$: integers $6$, $10$, $21$ are nearly prime. In the sixth test case, $n=100=2 + 2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 11 + 5 \cdot 11$: integers $10$, $33$, $55$ are nearly prime. In the seventh test case, $n=258=2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 7 + 13 \cdot 17 + 2 \cdot 3$: integers $10$, $21$, $221$, $6$ are nearly prime.
