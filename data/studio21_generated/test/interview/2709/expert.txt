 you code a program to solve a problem. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer $N$ and $t$ ($3 \leq N \leq 200000$; $1 \leq t \leq 7$).  The second line of the input contains $N$ non-negative $32$-bit signed integers. -----Output----- For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of $t$. -----Scoring----- There are $20$ hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.  All $20$ test cases will be tested.  Each hidden test case worth $5$ points (the $7$ sample test cases below worth $0$ point). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 1: 7 Sample Input 2: 7 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 2: Smaller Sample Input 3: 7 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 3: 2 Sample Input 4: 7 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 4: 28 Sample Input 5: 7 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sample Output 5: 12 Sample Input 6: 10 6 7 4 11 37 14 22 40 17 11 3 Sample Output 6: helloworld
