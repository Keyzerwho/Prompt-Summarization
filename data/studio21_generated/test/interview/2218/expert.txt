 You are given a number $n$ and a value $k$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $k$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $k=5$, numbers divisible by $k$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 50; 1 ≤ k ≤  $\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$) — the number of soldiers and the number of days in the pageant, correspondingly. The second line contains space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^7) — the beauties of the battalion soldiers. It is guaranteed that Payne's battalion doesn't have two soldiers with the same beauty. -----Output----- Print k lines: in the i-th line print the description of the detachment that will participate in the pageant on the i-th day. The description consists of integer c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) — the number of soldiers in the detachment on the i-th day of the pageant and c_{i} distinct integers p_{1, }i, p_{2, }i, ..., p_{c}_{i}, i — the beauties of the soldiers in the detachment on the i-th day of the pageant. The beauties of the soldiers are allowed to print in any order. Separate numbers on the lines by spaces. It is guaranteed that there is the solution that meets the problem conditions. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 1 2 3 Output 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 Input 2 1 7 12 Output 1 12
