 You are given a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. The sequence is interpreted as a sequence of questions and answers. You are trying to find an integer $y$ that:   1) satisfies all questions, 2) satisfies all answers, and 3) is the minimum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000) — the number of questions (and answers). Next n lines each contain one question and one answer to it. The format of each line is like that: "sign x answer", where the sign is:  ">" (for the first type queries),  "<" (for the second type queries),  ">=" (for the third type queries),  "<=" (for the fourth type queries).  All values of x are integer and meet the inequation  - 10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The answer is an English letter "Y" (for "yes") or "N" (for "no"). Consequtive elements in lines are separated by a single space. -----Output----- Print any of such integers y, that the answers to all the queries are correct. The printed number y must meet the inequation  - 2·10^9 ≤ y ≤ 2·10^9. If there are many answers, print any of them. If such value doesn't exist, print word "Impossible" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 4 >= 1 Y < 3 N <= -3 N > 55 N Output 17 Input 2 > 100 Y < -100 Y Output Impossible
