 You are given an array of numbers. Make sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order. Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of pieces in the chocolate bar. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1), where 0 represents a piece without the nut and 1 stands for a piece with the nut. -----Output----- Print the number of ways to break the chocolate into multiple parts so that each part would contain exactly one nut. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 1 0 Output 1 Input 5 1 0 1 0 1 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample there is exactly one nut, so the number of ways equals 1 — Bob shouldn't make any breaks. In the second sample you can break the bar in four ways: 10|10|1 1|010|1 10|1|01 1|01|01
