 You are given 3 integers - the number of enemies, the number of kids, and the number $c$ of kids that can fit on the bus. You need to find the number of groups, as well as a division of the class into these minimum number of groups. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $n$, $k$, and $c$ ($1 \le n \le 17$, $0 \le k \le \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ and $1 \le c \le n$) – the number of kids, pairs of enemies, and the capacity of the bus, respectively. Then follow $n$ lines with the kids’ names. Each name consists solely of the characters A-Z and a-z, is non-empty, and at most $10$ characters long. Then follow $k$ lines, each containing a pair of space-separated names indicating a pair of kids that dislike each other. No pair of names appears twice, and no kid is their own enemy. -----Output----- On the first line, output the minimum number of groups, followed by one line per group containing the names of the children in that group (separated by spaces). -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 0 1 Alice Bob Sample Output: 2 Alice Bob
