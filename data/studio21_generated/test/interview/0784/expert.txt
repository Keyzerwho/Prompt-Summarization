 Given two numbers $a$ and $b$, transform $a$ into $b$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a < b ≤ 10^9) — the number which Vasily has and the number he wants to have. -----Output----- If there is no way to get b from a, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise print three lines. On the first line print "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain single integer k — the length of the transformation sequence. On the third line print the sequence of transformations x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}, where:  x_1 should be equal to a,  x_{k} should be equal to b,  x_{i} should be obtained from x_{i} - 1 using any of two described operations (1 < i ≤ k).  If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 162 Output YES 5 2 4 8 81 162  Input 4 42 Output NO Input 100 40021 Output YES 5 100 200 2001 4002 40021
