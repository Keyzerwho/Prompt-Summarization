 You are given an integer $a$. You need to find the number of d-magic numbers in the segment $[a, b]$ that are multiple of $m$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers m, d (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9) — the parameters from the problem statement. The second line contains positive integer a in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes). The third line contains positive integer b in decimal presentation (without leading zeroes). It is guaranteed that a ≤ b, the number of digits in a and b are the same and don't exceed 2000. -----Output----- Print the only integer a — the remainder after dividing by 10^9 + 7 of the number of d-magic numbers in segment [a, b] that are multiple of m. -----Examples----- Input 2 6 10 99 Output 8 Input 2 0 1 9 Output 4 Input 19 7 1000 9999 Output 6 -----Note----- The numbers from the answer of the first example are 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 76, 86 and 96. The numbers from the answer of the second example are 2, 4, 6 and 8. The numbers from the answer of the third example are 1767, 2717, 5757, 6707, 8797 and 9747.
