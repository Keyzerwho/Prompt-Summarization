 You are given an integer $n$ ($0 \le n \le 100$). You are also given $s$ ($0 \le s \le 100$) and $t$ ($0 \le t \le s$) positive integers. You are also given $k$ ($0 \le k \le n$) integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ ($a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k$). For each $i$, $0 \le i \le k$, you need to return $\displaystyle\frac{t}{s}$ ($0 \le t \le s$) if JOE answers the question correctly, otherwise return $0$.   
-----Input----- The first and single line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), denoting the number of JOE's opponents in the show. -----Output----- Print a number denoting the maximum prize (in dollars) JOE could have. Your answer will be considered correct if it's absolute or relative error won't exceed $10^{-4}$. In other words, if your answer is $a$ and the jury answer is $b$, then it must hold that $\frac{|a - b|}{max(1, b)} \le 10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1.000000000000 Input 2 Output 1.500000000000 -----Note----- In the second example, the best scenario would be: one contestant fails at the first question, the other fails at the next one. The total reward will be $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{1} = 1.5$ dollars.
