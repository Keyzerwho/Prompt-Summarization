 You are given q numbers n_1, n_2, ..., n_{q}, for each i tell the maximum number of edges in a graph with n_{i} vertices, if at least half of the edges are bridges. Note that the graphs cannot contain multiple edges or self-loops. 
-----Input----- The first line of input file contains a positive integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100 000) — the number of graphs Ivan needs to construct. Then q lines follow, i-th line contains one positive integer n_{i} (1 ≤ n_{i} ≤ 2·10^9) — the number of vertices in i-th graph. Note that in hacks you have to use q = 1. -----Output----- Output q numbers, i-th of them must be equal to the maximum number of edges in i-th graph. -----Example----- Input 3 3 4 6 Output 2 3 6 -----Note----- In the first example it is possible to construct these graphs:  1 - 2, 1 - 3;  1 - 2, 1 - 3, 2 - 4;  1 - 2, 1 - 3, 2 - 3, 1 - 4, 2 - 5, 3 - 6.
