 You are given a tree with $N$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $N$.  For every edge in the tree, you are given two vertices.  You need to paint each vertex in the tree white or black so that the following condition is satisfied:  - For any two vertices painted in the same color, the distance between them is an even number. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N u_1 v_1 w_1 u_2 v_2 w_2 . . . u_{N - 1} v_{N - 1} w_{N - 1} -----Output----- Print a coloring of the vertices that satisfies the condition, in N lines. The i-th line should contain 0 if Vertex i is painted white and 1 if it is painted black. If there are multiple colorings that satisfy the condition, any of them will be accepted. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 2 2 2 3 1 -----Sample Output----- 0 0 1
