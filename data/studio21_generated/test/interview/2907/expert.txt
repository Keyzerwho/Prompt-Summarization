     You are given 2 strings $s$ and $t$. Encode $s$ into $t$. For each string, check if Boris sees more steps that annoy him than steps that don t. If Boris sees more steps that don t, Boris will give $t$ to his colleague. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $O$ ($1 \le O \le 25$) that represent the offset used for the rotation cipher. The second line contains the message to encode, which consists entirely of lowercase English characters. The length of the message is between $1$ and $80$ characters. The third line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 26$), the number of times the cipher must be applied. -----Output----- Output ‘Boris’ if strictly more steps sound good than bad, and ‘Colleague’ otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 thequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthelazydog 10 Sample Output: Boris
