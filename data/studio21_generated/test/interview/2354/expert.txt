 you are given a list of numbers. You are to answer how many of those numbers have a 1 in the 4th column. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$, $1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the size of the board and the number of queries. The next $q$ lines contain two integers each. The $i$-th line contains two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$) — description of the $i$-th query. -----Output----- For each query from $1$ to $q$ print the answer to this query. The answer to the $i$-th query is the number written in the cell $x_i, y_i$ ($x_i$ is the row, $y_i$ is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Queries are numbered from $1$ to $q$ in order of the input. -----Examples----- Input 4 5 1 1 4 4 4 3 3 2 2 4 Output 1 8 16 13 4 Input 5 4 2 1 4 2 3 3 3 4 Output 16 9 7 20 -----Note----- Answers to the queries from examples are on the board in the picture from the problem statement.
