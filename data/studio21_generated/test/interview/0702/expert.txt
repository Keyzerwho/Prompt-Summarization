 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 50$) â€” the size of the board. The following $n$ lines describe the board. The $i$-th line ($1 \leq i \leq n$) contains a single string of length $n$. Its $j$-th character ($1 \leq j \leq n$) is equal to "." if the cell in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column is free; it is equal to "#" if it's occupied. You can assume that the board contains at least one free cell. -----Output----- Output YES if the board can be tiled by Alice's pieces, or NO otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 3 #.# ... #.# Output YES Input 4 ##.# #... #### ##.# Output NO Input 5 #.### ....# #.... ###.# ##### Output YES Input 5 #.### ....# #.... ....# #..## Output NO -----Note----- The following sketches show the example boards and their tilings if such tilings exist:  [Image]
