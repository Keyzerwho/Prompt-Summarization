 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The only line contains one integer — $b$ $(1 \le b \le 10^{10})$. -----Output----- Print one number — answer for the problem. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1 Input 2 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example $[a, \,\, 1] = a$, therefore $\frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a}$ is always equal to $1$. In the second example $[a, \,\, 2]$ can be equal to $a$ or $2 \cdot a$ depending on parity of $a$. $\frac{[a, \,\, b]}{a}$ can be equal to $1$ and $2$.
