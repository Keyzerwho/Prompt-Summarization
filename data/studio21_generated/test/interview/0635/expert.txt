 You are given numbers $n$, $s$, $t$ and $m$. You are given a list of pairs of numbers $(i,j)$ such that $i$ and $j$ are integers, $i \neq j$, $i \neq s$ and $i \neq t$. Each pair $(i,j)$ represents whether station $i$ is closed for track $j$ or not. Your task is to determine whether Bob can travel to Alice's home by metro. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($2 \le s \le n \le 1000$) — the number of stations in the metro and the number of the station where Alice's home is located. Bob lives at station $1$. Next lines describe information about closed and open stations. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($a_i = 0$ or $a_i = 1$). If $a_i = 1$, then the $i$-th station is open on the first track (that is, in the direction of increasing station numbers). Otherwise the station is closed on the first track. The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($b_i = 0$ or $b_i = 1$). If $b_i = 1$, then the $i$-th station is open on the second track (that is, in the direction of decreasing station numbers). Otherwise the station is closed on the second track. -----Output----- Print "YES" (quotes for clarity) if Bob will be able to commute to the Alice's home by metro and "NO" (quotes for clarity) otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 5 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output YES Input 5 4 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 Output YES Input 5 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example, all stations are opened, so Bob can simply travel to the station with number $3$. In the second example, Bob should travel to the station $5$ first, switch to the second track and travel to the station $4$ then. In the third example, Bob simply can't enter the train going in the direction of Alice's home.
