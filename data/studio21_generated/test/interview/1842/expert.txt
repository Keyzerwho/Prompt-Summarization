 You are given two real numbers $a$ and $b$. The greater of these roots corresponds to the optimistic scenario, the smaller one corresponds to the pessimistic one. Help to get these estimates, first the optimistic, then the pessimistic one. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains three integers a, b, c ( - 1000 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) — the coefficients of ax^2 + bx + c = 0 equation. -----Output----- In the first line output the greater of the equation roots, in the second line output the smaller one. Absolute or relative error should not be greater than 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 1 30 200 Output -10.000000000000000 -20.000000000000000
