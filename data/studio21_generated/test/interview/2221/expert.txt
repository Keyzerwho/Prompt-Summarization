 You have coordinates of a ship, and the wind forecast. Determine the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point $(x_2, y_2)$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $x_1, y_1$ ($0 \le x_1, y_1 \le 10^9$) — the initial coordinates of the ship. The second line contains two integers $x_2, y_2$ ($0 \le x_2, y_2 \le 10^9$) — the coordinates of the destination point. It is guaranteed that the initial coordinates and destination point coordinates are different. The third line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of the string $s$. The fourth line contains the string $s$ itself, consisting only of letters U, D, L and R. -----Output----- The only line should contain the minimal number of days required for the ship to reach the point $(x_2, y_2)$. If it's impossible then print "-1". -----Examples----- Input 0 0 4 6 3 UUU Output 5 Input 0 3 0 0 3 UDD Output 3 Input 0 0 0 1 1 L Output -1 -----Note----- In the first example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: "RRRRU". Then its coordinates will change accordingly: $(0, 0)$ $\rightarrow$ $(1, 1)$ $\rightarrow$ $(2, 2)$ $\rightarrow$ $(3, 3)$ $\rightarrow$ $(4, 4)$ $\rightarrow$ $(4, 6)$. In the second example the ship should perform the following sequence of moves: "DD" (the third day it should stay in place). Then its coordinates will change accordingly: $(0, 3)$ $\rightarrow$ $(0, 3)$ $\rightarrow$ $(0, 1)$ $\rightarrow$ $(0, 0)$. In the third example the ship can never reach the point $(0, 1)$.
