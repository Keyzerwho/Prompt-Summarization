 Artem wants to find out if the grasshopper will ever jump out of the strip. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — length of the strip.  Next line contains a string of length n which consists of characters "<" and ">" only, that provide the direction of the jump from the corresponding cell. Next line contains n integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the length of the jump from the i-th cell. -----Output----- Print "INFINITE" (without quotes) if grasshopper will continue his jumps forever. Otherwise print "FINITE" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 2 >< 1 2 Output FINITE Input 3 >>< 2 1 1 Output INFINITE -----Note----- In the first sample grasshopper starts from the first cell and jumps to the right on the next cell. When he is in the second cell he needs to jump two cells left so he will jump out of the strip. Second sample grasshopper path is 1 - 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 and so on. The path is infinite.
