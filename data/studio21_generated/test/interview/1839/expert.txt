 You are given a list of intersections. On each day, a team arrives at the intersection. If the roads at the intersection were already asphalted, the team leaves the intersection. Otherwise, the team asphalts the roads. If the team asphalts both roads, the intersection is asphalted. Otherwise, the intersection is not asphalted. You have to tell which days at least one intersection will be asphalted. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of vertical and horizontal roads in the city.  Next n^2 lines contain the order of intersections in the schedule. The i-th of them contains two numbers h_{i}, v_{i} (1 ≤ h_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n), separated by a space, and meaning that the intersection that goes i-th in the timetable is at the intersection of the h_{i}-th horizontal and v_{i}-th vertical roads. It is guaranteed that all the intersections in the timetable are distinct. -----Output----- In the single line print the numbers of the days when road works will be in progress in ascending order. The days are numbered starting from 1. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 Output 1 4  Input 1 1 1 Output 1  -----Note----- In the sample the brigade acts like that:  On the first day the brigade comes to the intersection of the 1-st horizontal and the 1-st vertical road. As none of them has been asphalted, the workers asphalt the 1-st vertical and the 1-st horizontal road;  On the second day the brigade of the workers comes to the intersection of the 1-st horizontal and the 2-nd vertical road. The 2-nd vertical road hasn't been asphalted, but as the 1-st horizontal road has been asphalted on the first day, the workers leave and do not asphalt anything;  On the third day the brigade of the workers come to the intersection of the 2-nd horizontal and the 1-st vertical road. The 2-nd horizontal road hasn't been asphalted but as the 1-st vertical road has been asphalted on the first day, the workers leave and do not asphalt anything;  On the fourth day the brigade come to the intersection formed by the intersection of the 2-nd horizontal and 2-nd vertical road. As none of them has been asphalted, the workers asphalt the 2-nd vertical and the 2-nd horizontal road.
