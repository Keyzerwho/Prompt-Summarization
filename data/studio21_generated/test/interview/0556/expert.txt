 You are given integers l, r and k, you need to print all powers of number k within range from l to r inclusive. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers l, r and k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print all powers of number k, that lie within range from l to r in the increasing order. If there are no such numbers, print "-1" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 1 10 2 Output 1 2 4 8  Input 2 4 5 Output -1 -----Note----- Note to the first sample: numbers 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8 lie within the specified range. The number 2^4 = 16 is greater then 10, thus it shouldn't be printed.
