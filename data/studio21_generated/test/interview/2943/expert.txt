 You are given a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and you want to find a subsequence where the difference between the number of R and the number of B is maximized. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing a string of $n$ characters ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), describing the color of the raindrops in sections $1$ to $n$. It is guaranteed that the string consists of uppercase ASCII letters ‘R’ and ‘B’ only. -----Output----- Print, on a single line, two space-separated integers that describe the starting and ending positions of the part of Linearland that had the least purple rain. If there are multiple possible answers, print the one that has the Westernmost (smallest-numbered) starting section. If there are multiple answers with the same Westernmost starting section, print the one with the Westernmost ending section. -----Examples----- Sample Input: BBRRBRRBRB Sample Output: 3 7
