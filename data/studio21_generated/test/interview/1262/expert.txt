 you are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum cost to provide electricity to all cities. 
-----Input----- First line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2000$) — the number of cities. Then, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains two space-separated integers $x_i$ ($1 \leq x_i \leq 10^6$) and $y_i$ ($1 \leq y_i \leq 10^6$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th city. The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9$) — the cost of building a power station in the $i$-th city. The last line contains $n$ space-separated integers $k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n$ ($1 \leq k_i \leq 10^9$). -----Output----- In the first line print a single integer, denoting the minimum amount of yen needed. Then, print an integer $v$ — the number of power stations to be built. Next, print $v$ space-separated integers, denoting the indices of cities in which a power station will be built. Each number should be from $1$ to $n$ and all numbers should be pairwise distinct. You can print the numbers in arbitrary order. After that, print an integer $e$ — the number of connections to be made. Finally, print $e$ pairs of integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le n$, $a \ne b$), denoting that a connection between City $a$ and City $b$ will be made. Each unordered pair of cities should be included at most once (for each $(a, b)$ there should be no more $(a, b)$ or $(b, a)$ pairs). You can print the pairs in arbitrary order. If there are multiple ways to choose the cities and the connections to obtain the construction of minimum price, then print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 3 1 1 3 2 3 2 3 3 2 3 Output 8 3 1 2 3  0 Input 3 2 1 1 2 3 3 23 2 23 3 2 3 Output 27 1 2  2 1 2 2 3 -----Note----- For the answers given in the samples, refer to the following diagrams (cities with power stations are colored green, other cities are colored blue, and wires are colored red): [Image] For the first example, the cost of building power stations in all cities is $3 + 2 + 3 = 8$. It can be shown that no configuration costs less than 8 yen. For the second example, the cost of building a power station in City 2 is 2. The cost of connecting City 1 and City 2 is $2 \cdot (3 + 2) = 10$. The cost of connecting City 2 and City 3 is $3 \cdot (2 + 3) = 15$. Thus the total cost is $2 + 10 + 15 = 27$. It can be shown that no configuration costs less than 27 yen.
