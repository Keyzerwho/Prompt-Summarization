 You are given n friends. Each friend occupies a rectangle of pixels. You need to print minimum size of each photo in pixels. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of friends.  Then n lines follow: the i-th line contains information about the i-th friend. The line contains a pair of integers w_{i}, h_{i} (1 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 10, 1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 1000) — the width and height in pixels of the corresponding rectangle. -----Output----- Print n space-separated numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, where b_{i} — the total number of pixels on the minimum photo containing all friends expect for the i-th one. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 10 5 5 10 1 Output 75 110 60  Input 3 2 1 1 2 2 1 Output 6 4 6
