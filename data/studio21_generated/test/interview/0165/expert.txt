 You are given three integers (i, j, k), where i is the arrival time of the sanatorium, j is the departure time of the sanatorium, and k is the number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed. Your task is to determine the minimum number of meals that Vasiliy could have missed. 
-----Input----- The only line contains three integers b, d and s (0 ≤ b, d, s ≤ 10^18,  b + d + s ≥ 1) — the number of breakfasts, dinners and suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium.  -----Output----- Print single integer — the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy could have missed during his vacation.  -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 Output 1 Input 1 0 0 Output 0 Input 1 1 1 Output 0 Input 1000000000000000000 0 1000000000000000000 Output 999999999999999999 -----Note----- In the first sample, Vasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived before breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day of arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day.  In the second sample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and immediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal. In the third sample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any meal.
