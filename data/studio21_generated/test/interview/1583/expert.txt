 You are given two integers. You need to find the largest possible angle that can be formed without spilling water. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: a b x -----Output----- Print the maximum angle in which we can tilt the bottle without spilling any water, in degrees. Your output will be judged as correct when the absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-6}. -----Sample Input----- 2 2 4 -----Sample Output----- 45.0000000000 This bottle has a cubic shape, and it is half-full. The water gets spilled when we tilt the bottle more than 45 degrees.
