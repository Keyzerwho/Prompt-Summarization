 You are given an array of size $n$ and an integer $k$. You want to find $m$ arrays of size $n$ such that:  The size of each array is equal to $n$.  For all $1 \leq j \leq n$, the sum of arrays $b_i$ is equal to $a_j$.  The number of different elements in each array $b_i$ is at most $k$.  Find the minimum possible value of $m$, or report that there is no possible $m$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$): the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$, $1 \leq k \leq n$). The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \leq 100$, $a_n > 0$). -----Output----- For each test case print a single integer: the minimum possible value of $m$. If there is no such $m$, print $-1$. -----Example----- Input 6 4 1 0 0 0 1 3 1 3 3 3 11 3 0 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 9 4 2 2 3 5 7 11 13 13 17 10 7 0 1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 Output -1 1 2 2 2 1 -----Note----- In the first test case, there is no possible $m$, because all elements of all arrays should be equal to $0$. But in this case, it is impossible to get $a_4 = 1$ as the sum of zeros. In the second test case, we can take $b_1 = [3, 3, 3]$. $1$ is the smallest possible value of $m$. In the third test case, we can take $b_1 = [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]$ and $b_2 = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]$. It's easy to see, that $a_i = b_{1, i} + b_{2, i}$ for all $i$ and the number of different elements in $b_1$ and in $b_2$ is equal to $3$ (so it is at most $3$). It can be proven that $2$ is the smallest possible value of $m$.
