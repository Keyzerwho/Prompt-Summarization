 Given two configurations of the school, determine if every sequence of instructions that the senior student took to get to the dormitory will also lead you to the dormitory. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 1000$), indicating the number of rooms in the school. The rooms are numbered $1$ to $n$, where room $1$ is the entrance and room $n$ is the dormitory. The next $n$ lines of input describe the configuration of the school when the senior student walked to the dormitory, followed by another $n$ lines describing the configuration of the school when you start to walk to the dormitory. The $i^\textrm {th}$ line in the school configuration consists of four non-negative integers, indicating which room exits $1, 2, 3$ and $4$ lead to. If the room number is $0$, the corresponding exit is blocked. -----Output----- If it is not possible for the senior student to walk from the entrance to the dormitory, display Impossible. If it is possible, display Yes if you can get from the entrance to the dormitory by following any sequence of instructions taking the senior student from the entrance to the dormitory. Otherwise, display No. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 Sample Output: Yes
