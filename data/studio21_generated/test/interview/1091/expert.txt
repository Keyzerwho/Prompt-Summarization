 You are at an auction. You are given a list of numbers $a = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h]$. You are required to find the highest price and the second highest price. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number of bidders. The second line contains n distinct integer numbers p_1, p_2, ... p_{n}, separated by single spaces (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 10000), where p_{i} stands for the price offered by the i-th bidder. -----Output----- The single output line should contain two integers: index of the winner and the price he will pay. Indices are 1-based. -----Examples----- Input 2 5 7 Output 2 5 Input 3 10 2 8 Output 1 8 Input 6 3 8 2 9 4 14 Output 6 9
