 Given two sliding puzzles, determine if there exists a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration. 
-----Input----- The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position. -----Output----- Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input AB XC XB AC Output YES Input AB XC AC BX Output NO -----Note----- The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down. In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
