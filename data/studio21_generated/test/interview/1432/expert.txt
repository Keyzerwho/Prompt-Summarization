 Given an array of dams and mountains. Find the amount of rain each mountain received. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 A_2 ... A_N -----Output----- Print N integers representing the number of liters of rain Mountain 1, Mountain 2, ..., Mountain N received, in this order. -----Sample Input----- 3 2 2 4 -----Sample Output----- 4 0 4 If we assume Mountain 1, 2, and 3 received 4, 0, and 4 liters of rain, respectively, it is consistent with this input, as follows:  - Dam 1 should have accumulated \frac{4}{2} + \frac{0}{2} = 2 liters of water.  - Dam 2 should have accumulated \frac{0}{2} + \frac{4}{2} = 2 liters of water.  - Dam 3 should have accumulated \frac{4}{2} + \frac{4}{2} = 4 liters of water.
