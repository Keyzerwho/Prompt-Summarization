 You are given 2 integer arrays of length n, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the number of countries n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). The second line contains n non-negative integers a_{i} without leading zeroes — the number of tanks of the i-th country. It is guaranteed that the second line contains at least n - 1 beautiful numbers and the total length of all these number's representations doesn't exceed 100 000. -----Output----- Print a single number without leading zeroes — the product of the number of tanks presented by each country. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 10 1 Output 50 Input 4 1 1 10 11 Output 110 Input 5 0 3 1 100 1 Output 0 -----Note----- In sample 1 numbers 10 and 1 are beautiful, number 5 is not not. In sample 2 number 11 is not beautiful (contains two '1's), all others are beautiful. In sample 3 number 3 is not beautiful, all others are beautiful.
