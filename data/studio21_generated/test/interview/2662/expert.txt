 You are given N integers. For each of these N integers, we will choose a color and paint the integer with that color. Here the following condition must be satisfied:  - If A_i and A_j (i < j) are painted with the same color, A_i < A_j. Find the minimum number of colors required to satisfy the condition. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 : A_N -----Output----- Print the minimum number of colors required to satisfy the condition. -----Sample Input----- 5 2 1 4 5 3 -----Sample Output----- 2 We can satisfy the condition with two colors by, for example, painting 2 and 3 red and painting 1, 4, and 5 blue.
