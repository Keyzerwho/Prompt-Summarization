 You are given n, m, k and Ivan's timetable. Given n, m, k and Ivan's timetable, can you determine the minimum number of hours he has to spend in the university during one week, if he cannot skip more than k lessons. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ k ≤ 500) — the number of days in the Berland week, the number of working hours during each day, and the number of lessons Ivan can skip, respectively. Then n lines follow, i-th line containing a binary string of m characters. If j-th character in i-th line is 1, then Ivan has a lesson on i-th day during j-th hour (if it is 0, there is no such lesson). -----Output----- Print the minimum number of hours Ivan has to spend in the university during the week if he skips not more than k lessons. -----Examples----- Input 2 5 1 01001 10110 Output 5 Input 2 5 0 01001 10110 Output 8 -----Note----- In the first example Ivan can skip any of two lessons during the first day, so he spends 1 hour during the first day and 4 hours during the second day. In the second example Ivan can't skip any lessons, so he spends 4 hours every day.
