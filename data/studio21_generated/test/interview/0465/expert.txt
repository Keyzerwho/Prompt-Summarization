 Given 3 integers find an adjacency matrix of such an undirected graph that the number of components in it is equal to 3 and the number of components in its complement is 2. 
-----Input----- In a single line, three numbers are given $n, a, b \,(1 \le n \le 1000, 1 \le a, b \le n)$: is the number of vertexes of the graph, the required number of connectivity components in it, and the required amount of the connectivity component in it's complement.  -----Output----- If there is no graph that satisfies these constraints on a single line, print "NO" (without quotes). Otherwise, on the first line, print "YES"(without quotes). In each of the next $n$ lines, output $n$ digits such that $j$-th digit of $i$-th line must be $1$ if and only if there is an edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$ (and $0$ otherwise). Note that the matrix must be symmetric, and all digits on the main diagonal must be zeroes.  If there are several matrices that satisfy the conditions â€” output any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 Output YES 001 001 110 Input 3 3 3 Output NO
