 You are given an array of integers $a$. The array consists of n integers. The array is sorted in ascending order. There are m integers from $1$ to $n$. The CEO wants to determine the number of ways to fill the parking lot this way. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 30) — the amount of successive cars of the same make. -----Output----- Output one integer — the number of ways to fill the parking lot by cars of four makes using the described way. -----Examples----- Input 3 Output 24 -----Note----- Let's denote car makes in the following way: A — Aston Martin, B —   Bentley, M — Mercedes-Maybach, Z — Zaporozhets. For n = 3 there are the following appropriate ways to fill the parking lot: AAAB AAAM AAAZ ABBB AMMM AZZZ BBBA BBBM BBBZ BAAA BMMM BZZZ MMMA MMMB MMMZ MAAA MBBB MZZZ ZZZA ZZZB ZZZM ZAAA ZBBB ZMMM Originally it was planned to grant sport cars of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Bugatti makes but this idea was renounced because it is impossible to drive these cars having small road clearance on the worn-down roads of IT City.
