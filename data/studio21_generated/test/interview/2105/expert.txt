 You are given two sequences of strings of size $n$ and $m$ and also $q$ queries. For each query, you will be given the current year. Could you find the name corresponding to the given year, according to the Gapja system  
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n, m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 20$). The next line contains $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{n}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$. The next line contains $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{m}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$. Among the given $n + m$ strings may be duplicates (that is, they are not necessarily all different). The next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2\,020$). In the next $q$ lines, an integer $y$ ($1 \le y \le 10^9$) is given, denoting the year we want to know the name for. -----Output----- Print $q$ lines. For each line, print the name of the year as per the rule described above. -----Example----- Input 10 12 sin im gye gap eul byeong jeong mu gi gyeong yu sul hae ja chuk in myo jin sa o mi sin 14 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 73 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Output sinyu imsul gyehae gapja gyeongo sinmi imsin gyeyu gyeyu byeongsin jeongyu musul gihae gyeongja -----Note----- The first example denotes the actual names used in the Gapja system. These strings usually are either a number or the name of some animal.
