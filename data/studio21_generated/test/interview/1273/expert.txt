 You are given a tree with N vertices numbered from 1 to N. You need to find the minimum possible number of colors to paint the edges such that vertices are painted with different color. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2 \vdots a_{N-1} b_{N-1} -----Output----- Print N lines. The first line should contain K, the number of colors used. The (i+1)-th line (1 \le i \le N-1) should contain c_i, the integer representing the color of the i-th edge, where 1 \le c_i \le K must hold. If there are multiple colorings with the minimum number of colors that satisfy the condition, printing any of them will be accepted. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 2 2 3 -----Sample Output----- 2 1 2
