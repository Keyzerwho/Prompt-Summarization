 Given debt relationships between all the employees, determine in which order they should be invited to the office of the R1 company CEO, or determine that the described order does not exist. 
-----Input----- The first line contains space-separated integers n and m $(2 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^{4} ; 1 \leq m \leq \operatorname{min}(10^{5}, \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}))$ — the number of employees in R1 and the number of debt relations. Each of the following m lines contains two space-separated integers a_{i}, b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n; a_{i} ≠ b_{i}), these integers indicate that the person number a_{i} owes money to a person a number b_{i}. Assume that all the employees are numbered from 1 to n. It is guaranteed that each pair of people p, q is mentioned in the input data at most once. In particular, the input data will not contain pairs p, q and q, p simultaneously. -----Output----- Print -1 if the described order does not exist. Otherwise, print the permutation of n distinct integers. The first number should denote the number of the person who goes to the CEO office first, the second number denote the person who goes second and so on. If there are multiple correct orders, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 1 2 Output 2 1  Input 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 Output 2 1 3
