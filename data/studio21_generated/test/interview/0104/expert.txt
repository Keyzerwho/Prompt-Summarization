 Your task is to determine the index of day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 200\,000$) â€” the number of days to prepare for the programming contests. The second line contains a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10\,000$), where $a_i$ equals to the number of problems, which Polycarp will solve on the $i$-th day. -----Output----- Print the index of the day when Polycarp will celebrate the equator. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 3 2 1 Output 2 Input 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example Polycarp will celebrate the equator on the evening of the second day, because up to this day (inclusive) he will solve $4$ out of $7$ scheduled problems on four days of the training. In the second example Polycarp will celebrate the equator on the evening of the third day, because up to this day (inclusive) he will solve $6$ out of $12$ scheduled problems on six days of the training.
