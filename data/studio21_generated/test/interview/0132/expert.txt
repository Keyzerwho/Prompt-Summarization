 You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either divide X into Y equal parts, or split Y into X equal parts. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 360)  — the number of pieces into which the delivered pizza was cut. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 360)  — the angles of the sectors into which the pizza was cut. The sum of all a_{i} is 360. -----Output----- Print one integer  — the minimal difference between angles of sectors that will go to Vasya and Petya. -----Examples----- Input 4 90 90 90 90 Output 0 Input 3 100 100 160 Output 40 Input 1 360 Output 360 Input 4 170 30 150 10 Output 0 -----Note----- In first sample Vasya can take 1 and 2 pieces, Petya can take 3 and 4 pieces. Then the answer is |(90 + 90) - (90 + 90)| = 0. In third sample there is only one piece of pizza that can be taken by only one from Vasya and Petya. So the answer is |360 - 0| = 360. In fourth sample Vasya can take 1 and 4 pieces, then Petya will take 2 and 3 pieces. So the answer is |(170 + 10) - (30 + 150)| = 0. Picture explaning fourth sample: [Image] Both red and green sectors consist of two adjacent pieces of pizza. So Vasya can take green sector, then Petya will take red sector.
