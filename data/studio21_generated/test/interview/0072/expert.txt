 You are given a list of words, you need to output a sorted list. Comparison should be case sensitive
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 10^{9}$) — the number of turns. Next 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively. Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $10^{5}$ uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different colors. -----Output----- Print the name of the winner ("Kuro", "Shiro" or "Katie"). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print "Draw". -----Examples----- Input 3 Kuroo Shiro Katie Output Kuro Input 7 treasurehunt threefriends hiCodeforces Output Shiro Input 1 abcabc cbabac ababca Output Katie Input 15 foPaErcvJ mZaxowpbt mkuOlaHRE Output Draw -----Note----- In the first example, after $3$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into ooooo, which has the beauty of $5$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $4$, for example by changing Shiro's ribbon into SSiSS and changing Katie's ribbon into Kaaaa). Therefore, the winner is Kuro. In the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $9$ and the number of turn is $15$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach the maximal beauty of $9$ by changing their strings into zzzzzzzzz after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into azzzzzzzz and then into zzzzzzzzz thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.
