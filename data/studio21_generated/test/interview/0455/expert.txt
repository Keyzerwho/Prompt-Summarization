 You are given N coordinates on the xy-plane. A given compass can point to (p,q) or (p,r) when d(p,q) = d(p,r) where d is the Manhattan distance. Initially, you are at (a,b) coordinates. You need to find the number of pairs of coordinates such that the compass can point. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N X_1 Y_1 X_2 Y_2 : X_N Y_N -----Output----- If the condition can be satisfied, follow the following format. If the condition cannot be satisfied, print -1. m d_1 d_2 ... d_m w_1 w_2 : w_N m and d_i are the configurations of the robot arm. Refer to the problem statement for what each of them means. Here, 1 \leq m \leq 40 and 1 \leq d_i \leq 10^{12} must hold. Also, m and d_i must all be integers. w_j is a string of length m that represents the way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to point (X_j, Y_j). The i-th character of w_j should be one of the letters L, R, D and U, representing the mode of Section i. -----Sample Input----- 3 -1 0 0 3 2 -1 -----Sample Output----- 2 1 2 RL UU DR In the given way to bring Joint m of the robot arm to each (X_j, Y_j), the positions of the joints will be as follows:  - To (X_1, Y_1) = (-1, 0): First, the position of Joint 0 is (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0). As the mode of Section 1 is R, the position of Joint 1 is (x_1, y_1) = (1, 0). Then, as the mode of Section 2 is L, the position of Joint 2 is (x_2, y_2) = (-1, 0).  - To (X_2, Y_2) = (0, 3): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, 1), (x_2, y_2) = (0, 3).  - To (X_3, Y_3) = (2, -1): (x_0, y_0) = (0, 0), (x_1, y_1) = (0, -1), (x_2, y_2) = (2, -1).
