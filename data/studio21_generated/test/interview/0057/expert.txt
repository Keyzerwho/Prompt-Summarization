 Given n vertices of a rectangle, calculate the area of the rectangle. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4) — the number of vertices that were not erased by Wilbur's friend. Each of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} ( - 1000 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 1000) —the coordinates of the i-th vertex that remains. Vertices are given in an arbitrary order. It's guaranteed that these points are distinct vertices of some rectangle, that has positive area and which sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. -----Output----- Print the area of the initial rectangle if it could be uniquely determined by the points remaining. Otherwise, print  - 1.  -----Examples----- Input 2 0 0 1 1 Output 1 Input 1 1 1 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample, two opposite corners of the initial rectangle are given, and that gives enough information to say that the rectangle is actually a unit square. In the second sample there is only one vertex left and this is definitely not enough to uniquely define the area.
