 Given an array of integers, return an array such that y_i is equal to the sum of first i elements of array x (0   i   m). Also, you are given a positive integer k. You need to find minimum possible i such that y_i contains a number which is larger or equal than k. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18). n is the size of array A^0. The second line contains n integers A^0_0, A^0_1... A^0_{n} - 1 — the elements of A^0 (0 ≤ A^0_{i} ≤ 10^9). At least two elements of A^0 are positive. -----Output----- Print the minimum i such that A^{i} contains a number which is larger or equal than k. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 6 1 1 1 Output 2 Input 3 1 1 0 1 Output 0
