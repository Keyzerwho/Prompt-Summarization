 Your need to create a function `moves` that accepts the state of the surface and returns the smallest number of moves needed to arrange all cubes into a rectangle. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \le N \le 100$, $1 \le M \le N^2$), the dimensions of the surface and the number of cubes currently on the surface. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \le R, C \le N$), the coordinates of the square that contains the cube. -----Output----- Output the smallest number of moves. A solution will always exist. -----Explanation of Sample Data----- In the first example, it suffices to move one of the cubes from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 2)$ or $(2, 1)$. In the third example, a cube is moved from $(2, 3)$ to $(3, 3)$, from $(4, 2)$ to $(2, 5)$ and from $(4, 4)$ to $(3, 5)$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 4 3 2 2 4 4 1 1 Sample Output 2: 2
