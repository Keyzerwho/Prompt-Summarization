 You are given an array of n numbers a_1, ..., a_{n}. After that for each k from 1 to n - 1 build the k-ary heap on the array and count the number of elements for which the property of the minimum-rooted heap is violated, i.e. the value of an element is less than the value of its parent. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- in a single line print n - 1 integers, separate the consecutive numbers with a single space — the number of elements for which the property of the k-ary heap is violated, for k = 1, 2, ..., n - 1. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 5 4 3 2 Output 3 2 1 0 Input 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 Output 0 0 0 0 0 -----Note----- Pictures with the heaps for the first sample are given below; elements for which the property of the heap is violated are marked with red. [Image] [Image] $\therefore$ [Image]  In the second sample all elements are equal, so the property holds for all pairs.
