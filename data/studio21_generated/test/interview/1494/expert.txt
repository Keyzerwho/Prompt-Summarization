 You are given a string s and a pattern string p. You are asked to find $\operatorname{ans}(x)$ for all x from 0 to |s| where |s| denotes the length of string s. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 000). The second line of the input contains the string p (1 ≤ |p| ≤ 500). Both strings will only consist of lower case English letters. -----Output----- Print |s| + 1 space-separated integers in a single line representing the $\operatorname{ans}(x)$ for all x from 0 to |s|. -----Examples----- Input aaaaa aa Output 2 2 1 1 0 0 Input axbaxxb ab Output 0 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 -----Note----- For the first sample, the corresponding optimal values of s' after removal 0 through |s| = 5 characters from s are {"aaaaa", "aaaa", "aaa", "aa", "a", ""}.  For the second sample, possible corresponding optimal values of s' are {"axbaxxb", "abaxxb", "axbab", "abab", "aba", "ab", "a", ""}.
