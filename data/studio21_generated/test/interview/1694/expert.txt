 You are given n spies, each spies has 2 numbers (a, b). The spies have to pass a note to another spy. The spies have to pass it in 2 steps. During the first step the spies can pass the note to any of their neighbours. During the second step the spies can pass the note to any of their neighbours. The spies cannot pass a note during the first step. The spies cannot pass a note during the second step. The spies cannot pass a note during the first step and the second step. The spies cannot pass the note during the first step and the second step and the third time. The spies cannot pass the note during the first step and the second step and the third time and the fourth time. The spies cannot pass the note during the first step and the second step and the third time and the fourth time and the fifth time. The spies cannot pass the note during the first step and the second step and the third time and the fourth time and the fifth time and the sixth time. and so on. The spies cannot pass the note during the first step and the second step and the third time and the fourth time and the fifth time and the sixth time and the seventh time and so on. The spies cannot pass the note during the first step and the second step and the third time and the fourth time and the fifth time and the sixth time and the seventh time and the eighth time and so on. and so on. and so on. and so on. and so on
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers n, m, s and f (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ s, f ≤ n; s ≠ f; n ≥ 2). Each of the following m lines contains three integers t_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n). It is guaranteed that t_1 < t_2 < t_3 < ... < t_{m}. -----Output----- Print k characters in a line: the i-th character in the line must represent the spies' actions on step i. If on step i the spy with the note must pass the note to the spy with a lesser number, the i-th character should equal "L". If on step i the spy with the note must pass it to the spy with a larger number, the i-th character must equal "R". If the spy must keep the note at the i-th step, the i-th character must equal "X". As a result of applying the printed sequence of actions spy s must pass the note to spy f. The number of printed characters k must be as small as possible. Xenia must not catch the spies passing the note. If there are miltiple optimal solutions, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that the answer exists. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 1 3 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 1 1 10 1 3 Output XXRR
