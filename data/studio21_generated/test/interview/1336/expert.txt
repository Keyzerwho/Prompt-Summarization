 There are famous Russian nesting dolls named matryoshkas sold in one of the souvenir stores nearby, and you'd like to buy several of them. The store has $n$ different matryoshkas. Any matryoshka is a figure of volume $out_i$ with an empty space inside of volume $in_i$ (of course, $out_i > in_i$). You don't have much free space inside your bag, but, fortunately, you know that matryoshkas can be nested one inside another. Formally, let's call a set of matryoshkas nested if we can rearrange dolls in such a way, that the first doll can be nested inside the second one, the second doll   inside the third one and so on. Matryoshka $i$ can be nested inside matryoshka $j$ if $out_i \le in_j$. So only the last doll will take space inside your bag. Let's call extra space of a nested set of dolls as a total volume of empty space inside this structure. Obviously, it's equal to $in_{i_1} + (in_{i_2} - out_{i_1}) + (in_{i_3} - out_{i_2
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of matryoshkas. The next $n$ lines contain a description of each doll: two integers $out_i$ and $in_i$ ($1 \le in_i < out_i \le 10^9$) — the outer and inners volumes of the $i$-th matryoshka. -----Output----- Print one integer — the number of big enough nested subsets such that extra space of each of these subsets is minimum possible. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Example----- Input 7 4 1 4 2 4 2 2 1 5 4 6 4 3 2 Output 6 -----Note----- There are $6$ big enough nested subsets with minimum possible extra space in the example:   $\{1, 5\}$: we can't add any other matryoshka and keep it nested; it's extra space is $1$;  $\{1, 6\}$;  $\{2, 4, 5\}$;  $\{2, 4, 6\}$;  $\{3, 4, 5\}$;  $\{3, 4, 6\}$.  There are no more "good" subsets because, for example, subset $\{6, 7\}$ is not big enough (we can add the $4$-th matryoshka to it) or subset $\{4, 6, 7\}$ has extra space equal to $2$.
