 Given two 2D polygons, determine if they are connected. Two polygons are connected if it's impossible to pull them to infinity in different directions by manipulating their edges, without having their edges or vertices intersect at any point   just like when two links of a chain are connected. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), which denotes the number of edges of the first polygon. The next N lines each contain the integers x, y and z ( - 1 000 000 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 1 000 000) — coordinates of the vertices, in the manner mentioned above. The next line contains an integer m (3 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) , denoting the number of edges of the second polygon, followed by m lines containing the coordinates of the second polygon’s vertices. It is guaranteed that both polygons are simple (no self-intersections), and in general that the obtained polygonal lines do not intersect each other. Also, you can assume that no 3 consecutive points of a polygon lie on the same line. -----Output----- Your output should contain only one line, with the words "YES" or "NO", depending on whether the two given polygons are well-connected.  -----Example----- Input 4 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 4 1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 3 -1 Output YES -----Note----- On the picture below, the two polygons are well-connected, as the edges of the vertical polygon cross the area of the horizontal one exactly once in one direction (for example, from above to below), and zero times in the other (in this case, from below to above). Note that the polygons do not have to be parallel to any of the xy-,xz-,yz- planes in general. [Image]
