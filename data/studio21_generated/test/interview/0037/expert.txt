 You have two guns Ebony and Ivory. Ebony can shoot any number of bullets. Ivory can shoot any number of bullets. Find if it is possible to shoot c bullets with Ebony and Ivory so that the damage dealt by Ebony is greater than or equal to the damage dealt by Ivory. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10 000) — the number of units of damage dealt by Ebony gun and Ivory gun, and the total number of damage required to break the shield, respectively. -----Output----- Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Dante can deal exactly c damage to the shield and "No" (without quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 4 6 15 Output No Input 3 2 7 Output Yes Input 6 11 6 Output Yes -----Note----- In the second sample, Dante can fire 1 bullet from Ebony and 2 from Ivory to deal exactly 1·3 + 2·2 = 7 damage. In the third sample, Dante can fire 1 bullet from ebony and no bullets from ivory to do 1·6 + 0·11 = 6 damage.
