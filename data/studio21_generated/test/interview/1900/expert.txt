 After n trips, bus has m passengers. They were then aligned in one line in the order they arrived, with people from the same bus standing in the order of their seats. Some teams were formed, each consisting of k participants form the same city standing next to each other in the line. Once formed, teams left the line. The teams were formed until there were no k neighboring participants from the same city. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, k and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5), where a_{i} is the number of city, person from which must take seat i in the bus.  -----Output----- Output the number of remaining participants in the line. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 5 1 2 3 1 Output 12 Input 1 9 10 1 Output 1 Input 3 2 10 1 2 1 Output 0 -----Note----- In the second example, the line consists of ten participants from the same city. Nine of them will form a team. At the end, only one participant will stay in the line.
