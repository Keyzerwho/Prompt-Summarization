 You are given n marks. You need to add n marks on the ruler so that Valery can measure x and y. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin. -----Output----- In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler. In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 250 185 230 0 185 250 Output 1 230 Input 4 250 185 230 0 20 185 250 Output 0 Input 2 300 185 230 0 300 Output 2 185 230 -----Note----- In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark. In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks. In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
