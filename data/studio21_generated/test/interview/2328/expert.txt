 You are given a list of numbers. You need to find the smallest number. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer $T$ ($ 1 \le T \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — number of queries. Next $2 \cdot T$ lines contain descriptions of queries. All queries are independent.  The first line of each query contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le k < n$) — the number of points and constant $k$. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9$) — points in ascending order. It's guaranteed that $\sum{n}$ doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- Print $T$ integers — corresponding points $x$ which have minimal possible value of $f_k(x)$. If there are multiple answers you can print any of them. -----Example----- Input 3 3 2 1 2 5 2 1 1 1000000000 1 0 4 Output 3 500000000 4
