 You are given an integer m and an integer n, and your task is to return the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 
-----Input----- The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial. -----Output----- First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 5 5 6 7 8 9  Input 5 Output 0 -----Note----- The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n. In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
