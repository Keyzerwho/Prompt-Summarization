 You are given a list of bacteria, and you need to return a list of bacteria. Each bacterium should be of mass $1$ initially. The bacteria can split, and the total mass of the bacterium should be $n$. Return the number of nights needed to obtain that mass. 
-----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^9$) — the sum of bacteria masses that Phoenix is interested in.  -----Output----- For each test case, if there is no way for the bacteria to exactly achieve total mass $n$, print -1. Otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain an integer $d$  — the minimum number of nights needed. The next line should contain $d$ integers, with the $i$-th integer representing the number of bacteria that should split on the $i$-th day. If there are multiple solutions, print any. -----Example----- Input 3 9 11 2 Output 3 1 0 2  3 1 1 2 1 0  -----Note----- In the first test case, the following process results in bacteria with total mass $9$:   Day $1$: The bacterium with mass $1$ splits. There are now two bacteria with mass $0.5$ each.  Night $1$: All bacteria's mass increases by one. There are now two bacteria with mass $1.5$.  Day $2$: None split.  Night $2$: There are now two bacteria with mass $2.5$.  Day $3$: Both bacteria split. There are now four bacteria with mass $1.25$.  Night $3$: There are now four bacteria with mass $2.25$.  The total mass is $2.25+2.25+2.25+2.25=9$. It can be proved that $3$ is the minimum number of nights needed. There are also other ways to obtain total mass 9 in 3 nights. $ $ In the second test case, the following process results in bacteria with total mass $11$:   Day $1$: The bacterium with mass $1$ splits. There are now two bacteria with mass $0.5$.  Night $1$: There are now two bacteria with mass $1.5$.  Day $2$: One bacterium splits. There are now three bacteria with masses $0.75$, $0.75$, and $1.5$.  Night $2$: There are now three bacteria with masses $1.75$, $1.75$, and $2.5$.  Day $3$: The bacteria with mass $1.75$ and the bacteria with mass $2.5$ split. There are now five bacteria with masses $0.875$, $0.875$, $1.25$, $1.25$, and $1.75$.  Night $3$: There are now five bacteria with masses $1.875$, $1.875$, $2.25$, $2.25$, and $2.75$.  The total mass is $1.875+1.875+2.25+2.25+2.75=11$. It can be proved that $3$ is the minimum number of nights needed. There are also other ways to obtain total mass 11 in 3 nights. $ $ In the third test case, the bacterium does not split on day $1$, and then grows to mass $2$ during night $1$.
