 You are given t requests, each of them contains numbers n_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i}. For each query you need to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly n_{i} berubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from l_{i} to r_{i} berubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each denomination can be used any number of times. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the number of universities t, (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) Each of the next t lines contain three space-separated integers: n_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i} (1 ≤ n_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i} ≤ 10^9; l_{i} ≤ r_{i}). -----Output----- For each query print on a single line: either "Yes", if Alexey can enter the university, or "No" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 2 5 2 3 6 4 5 Output Yes No -----Note----- You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins: one of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the second university cannot be paid.
