 Given a word, your task is to find out the number of distinct words it can generate by doing the cyclic shift operation arbitrarily many times. 
-----Input----- The first line of input will be a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 50), the word Hongcow initially learns how to spell. The string s consists only of lowercase English letters ('a'–'z'). -----Output----- Output a single integer equal to the number of distinct strings that Hongcow can obtain by applying the cyclic shift arbitrarily many times to the given string. -----Examples----- Input abcd Output 4 Input bbb Output 1 Input yzyz Output 2 -----Note----- For the first sample, the strings Hongcow can generate are "abcd", "dabc", "cdab", and "bcda". For the second sample, no matter how many times Hongcow does the cyclic shift, Hongcow can only generate "bbb". For the third sample, the two strings Hongcow can generate are "yzyz" and "zyzy".
