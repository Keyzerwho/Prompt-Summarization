 You are given $n$ strings $p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$. Calculate the beauty of the string $( \ldots (((p_1 \cdot p_2) \cdot p_3) \cdot \ldots ) \cdot p_n$, where $s \cdot t$ denotes a multiplication of strings $s$ and $t$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100\,000$) — the number of strings, wroted by Denis. Next $n$ lines contain non-empty strings $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, consisting of lowercase english letters. It's guaranteed, that the total length of the strings $p_i$ is at most $100\,000$, and that's the beauty of the resulting product is at most $10^9$. -----Output----- Print exactly one integer — the beauty of the product of the strings. -----Examples----- Input 3 a b a Output 3 Input 2 bnn a Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example, the product of strings is equal to "abaaaba". In the second example, the product of strings is equal to "abanana".
