 You are given a tree with n nodes. Each node has a value associated with it. You need to count the number of valid sets. A valid set is a set of nodes such that the sum of values of nodes in the set is less than or equal to a given value. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers d (0 ≤ d ≤ 2000) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The second line contains n space-separated positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}(1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2000). Then the next n - 1 line each contain pair of integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) denoting that there is an edge between u and v. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree. -----Output----- Print the number of valid sets modulo 1000000007. -----Examples----- Input 1 4 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 3 3 4 Output 8 Input 0 3 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 Output 3 Input 4 8 7 8 7 5 4 6 4 10 1 6 1 2 5 8 1 3 3 5 6 7 3 4 Output 41 -----Note----- In the first sample, there are exactly 8 valid sets: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {3, 4} and {1, 3, 4}. Set {1, 2, 3, 4} is not valid, because the third condition isn't satisfied. Set {1, 4} satisfies the third condition, but conflicts with the second condition.
