 You are given a list of items. You need to divide these items among Walter and Jesse so that each of them can go one trip to the store and buy their share of items without the risk of anyone becoming suspicious. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $N$, $1 \leq N < 100000$, the number of items they want to buy. The following $N$ lines contain the names of these items, all of which are different. A name consists of at most $20$ lowercase letters from the English alphabet or underscores, and is non-empty. The next line of input contains an integer $M$, $0 \leq M < 100000$, the number of pairs of items that are considered suspicious when bought together. Then follow $M$ lines, each containing the names of two different items that form a suspicious pair. Each suspicious pair will be listed exactly once. -----Output----- If it is possible for Walter and Jesse to divide the items among themselves, then output two lines. In the first line output the names of the items that Walter should buy. In the second line output the names of the items that Jesse should buy. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. If this is not possible, output impossible. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 battery_acid drain_cleaner antifreeze cold_medicine lantern_fuel 2 cold_medicine battery_acid antifreeze lantern_fuel Sample Output: lantern_fuel drain_cleaner battery_acid antifreeze cold_medicine
