 You are given a string $s$. Return true if $s$ is Berlanese, false otherwise.   
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of $|s|$ ($1\leq |s|\leq 100$) lowercase Latin letters. -----Output----- Print "YES" (without quotes) if there is a vowel after every consonant except "n", otherwise print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input sumimasen Output YES Input ninja Output YES Input codeforces Output NO -----Note----- In the first and second samples, a vowel goes after each consonant except "n", so the word is Berlanese. In the third sample, the consonant "c" goes after the consonant "r", and the consonant "s" stands on the end, so the word is not Berlanese.
