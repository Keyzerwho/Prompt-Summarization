 You are given a rumor R.  The rumor starts out being spread by a single person X.  On any given day, X tells one person Y, and on the following day, X tells another person Z.  
-----Input----- The first line will contain three integers: $0 < n \leq 100000$, $0 < m \leq 100000$, and $0 \leq d \leq 10000$, where $n$ is the number of people, $m$ is the number of connections, and $d$ is the number of days that elapse. The next $n$ lines will each consist of a unique string $s$ and an integer $0 \leq t \leq 1000$ where $s$ is the name of a person and $t$ is their level of skepticism. In other words, person $s$ must hear the rumor from $t$ distinct other people before $s$ will begin spreading the rumor. This is followed by $m$ lines each consisting of two strings $u$ and $v$ which indicates that person $u$ and person $v$ know each other. Each of these lines represents a unique pair of persons. The final line will contain a single string $r$, the name of the person that the rumor originates from. Note that $r$ is the only person with skepticism $t = 0$. All strings are between $1$ and $20$ characters long and consists only of English lowercase or uppercase letters and digits. -----Output----- Output a single integer: the number of people (not including person $r$) that have heard the rumor after $d$ days. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 2 1 Alice 0 Bob 1 Carol 1 Alice Bob Bob Carol Alice Sample Output: 1
