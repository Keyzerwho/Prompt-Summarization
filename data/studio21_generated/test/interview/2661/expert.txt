 You are given N numbers. You need to create N*N matrix. Each cell in the matrix will contain a number. The matrix must satisfy following conditions:  - Each cell in the matrix will contain a number.  - Each cell in the matrix will contain a number between 0 and 2^64.  - If S[i] = 0, then bitwise AND of cells from i-th row will be equal to U[i].  - If S[i] = 1, then bitwise OR of cells from i-th row will be equal to U[i].  - If T[i] = 0, then bitwise AND of cells from i-th column will be equal to V[i].  - If T[i] = 1, then bitwise OR of cells from i-th column will be equal to V[i]. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N S_{1} S_{2} ...  S_{N} T_{1} T_{2} ...  T_{N} U_{1} U_{2} ...  U_{N} V_{1} V_{2} ...  V_{N} -----Output----- If there exists a matrix that satisfies the conditions, print one such matrix in the following format: a_{1,1} ...  a_{1,N} : a_{N,1} ...  a_{N,N} Note that any matrix satisfying the conditions is accepted. If no matrix satisfies the conditions, print -1. -----Sample Input----- 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 -----Sample Output----- 1 1 1 0 In Sample Input 1, we need to find a matrix such that:  - the bitwise AND of the elements in the 1-st row is 1;  - the bitwise OR of the elements in the 2-nd row is 1;  - the bitwise OR of the elements in the 1-st column is 1;  - the bitwise AND of the elements in the 2-nd column is 0.
