 You are given two integers n and k. n is the number of cards that Petya and Vasya can take before the game. k is the number of cards that Petya and Vasya can take during the game. Return 1 if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards before the game and 0 otherwise.   
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number. The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards. -----Output----- If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more. In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 11 27 27 11 Output YES 11 27 Input 2 6 6 Output NO Input 6 10 20 30 20 10 20 Output NO Input 6 1 1 2 2 3 3 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards. In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct. In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
