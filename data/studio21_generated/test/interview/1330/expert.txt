 You are given an array $S$ of non-negative integers. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq n \leq 5000$), the number of students and the number of clubs in college. The second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($0 \leq p_i < 5000$), where $p_i$ is the potential of the $i$-th student. The third line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq m$), which means that $i$-th student is initially a member of the club with index $c_i$. The fourth line contains an integer $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq n$), number of days for which the director wants to know the maximum possible strength of the team.  Each of the next $d$ lines contains an integer $k_i$ ($1 \leq k_i \leq n$), which means that $k_i$-th student lefts their club on the $i$-th day. It is guaranteed, that the $k_i$-th student has not left their club earlier. -----Output----- For each of the $d$ days, print the maximum possible strength of the team on that day. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 0 1 2 2 0 1 2 2 3 2 5 3 2 4 5 1 Output 3 1 1 1 0 Input 5 3 0 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 3 2 5 4 2 3 5 1 Output 3 2 2 1 0 Input 5 5 0 1 2 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 4 2 3 5 4 Output 1 1 1 1 -----Note----- Consider the first example: On the first day, student $3$ leaves their club. Now, the remaining students are $1$, $2$, $4$ and $5$. We can select students $1$, $2$ and $4$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $3$. Note, that we can't select students $1$, $2$ and $5$, as students $2$ and $5$ belong to the same club. Also, we can't select students $1$, $3$ and $4$, since student $3$ has left their club. On the second day, student $2$ leaves their club. Now, the remaining students are $1$, $4$ and $5$. We can select students $1$, $4$ and $5$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $1$. On the third day, the remaining students are $1$ and $5$. We can select students $1$ and $5$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $1$. On the fourth day, the remaining student is $1$. We can select student $1$ to get maximum possible strength, which is $1$.  On the fifth day, no club has students and so the maximum possible strength is $0$.
