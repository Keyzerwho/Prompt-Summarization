 Tavas is a strange creature. Usually "zzz" comes out of people's mouth while sleeping, but string s of length n comes out from Tavas' mouth instead. [Image]  Today Tavas fell asleep in Malekas' place. While he was sleeping, Malekas did a little process on s. Malekas has a favorite string p. He determined all positions x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{k} where p matches s. More formally, for each x_{i} (1   i   k) he condition s_{x}_{i}s_{x}_{i} + 1... s_{x}_{i} + |p| - 1 = p is fullfilled. Then Malekas wrote down one of subsequences of x_1, x_2, ... x_{k} (possibly, he didn't write anything) on a piece of paper. Here a sequence b is a subsequence of sequence a if and only if we can turn a into b by removing some of its elements (maybe no one of them or all).
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m, the length of s and the length of the subsequence Malekas wrote down (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 0 ≤ m ≤ n - |p| + 1). The second line contains string p (1 ≤ |p| ≤ n). The next line contains m space separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m}, Malekas' subsequence (1 ≤ y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_{m} ≤ n - |p| + 1). -----Output----- In a single line print the answer modulo 1000 000 007. -----Examples----- Input 6 2 ioi 1 3 Output 26 Input 5 2 ioi 1 2 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample test all strings of form "ioioi?" where the question mark replaces arbitrary English letter satisfy. Here |x| denotes the length of string x. Please note that it's possible that there is no such string (answer is 0).
