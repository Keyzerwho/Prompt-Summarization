 You are given n numbers. Find at least one k-special table of size n   n. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) — the size of the table Alice is looking for and the column that should have maximum possible sum. -----Output----- First print the sum of the integers in the k-th column of the required table. Next n lines should contain the description of the table itself: first line should contains n elements of the first row, second line should contain n elements of the second row and so on. If there are multiple suitable table, you are allowed to print any. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 Output 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Input 5 3 Output 85 5 6 17 18 19 9 10 23 24 25 7 8 20 21 22 3 4 14 15 16 1 2 11 12 13
