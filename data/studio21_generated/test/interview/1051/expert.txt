 You are given K of the onsite finalists and their qualifying ranks (which start at 1, there are no ties). Determine the minimum possible number of contestants that declined the invitation to compete onsite in the final round. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains K (1 ≤ K ≤ 25), the number of onsite finalists you know. The second line of input contains r_1, r_2, ..., r_{K} (1 ≤ r_{i} ≤ 10^6), the qualifying ranks of the finalists you know. All these ranks are distinct. -----Output----- Print the minimum possible number of contestants that declined the invitation to compete onsite. -----Examples----- Input 25 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 28 Output 3 Input 5 16 23 8 15 4 Output 0 Input 3 14 15 92 Output 67 -----Note----- In the first example, you know all 25 onsite finalists. The contestants who ranked 1-st, 13-th, and 27-th must have declined, so the answer is 3.
