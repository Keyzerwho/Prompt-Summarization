 You are given a list of strings and a number N. Your task is to find the shortest original title for the new problem. If there are multiple such titles, choose the lexicographically minimum one. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) — the number of titles you've got to consider. Then follow n problem titles, one per line. Each title only consists of lowercase English letters (specifically, it doesn't contain any spaces) and has the length from 1 to 20, inclusive. -----Output----- Print a string, consisting of lowercase English letters — the lexicographically minimum shortest original title. -----Examples----- Input 5 threehorses goodsubstrings secret primematrix beautifulyear Output j Input 4 aa bdefghijklmn opqrstuvwxyz c Output ab -----Note----- In the first sample the first 9 letters of the English alphabet (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i) occur in the problem titles, so the answer is letter j. In the second sample the titles contain 26 English letters, so the shortest original title cannot have length 1. Title aa occurs as a substring in the first title.
