 Your task is to find the least number of minutes the gardener should spend to fulfill the request of the Queen. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers: n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1000). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — the heights of the trees in the row.  -----Output----- In the first line print a single integer p — the minimum number of minutes the gardener needs. In the next p lines print the description of his actions.  If the gardener needs to increase the height of the j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ n) tree from the left by x (x ≥ 1) meters, then print in the corresponding line "+ j x". If the gardener needs to decrease the height of the j-th (1 ≤ j ≤ n) tree from the left by x (x ≥ 1) meters, print on the corresponding line "- j x". If there are multiple ways to make a row of trees beautiful in the minimum number of actions, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 1 2 1 5 Output 2 + 3 2 - 4 1 Input 4 1 1 2 3 4 Output 0
