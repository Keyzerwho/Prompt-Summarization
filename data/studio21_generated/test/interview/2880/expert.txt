 You are given $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Each element of the matrix is a single letter. No two columns of the matrix are equal. Find the maximum number of rows that can be removed without breaking the no-equal-column rule. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($2 \le R, C \le 1000$), the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively. In each of the next $R$ lines there are $C$ small letters of the English alphabet. These $R \times C$ letters represent Mirkoâ€™s table (which does not have two equal columns). -----Output----- Output a single integer, the maximum number of rows which can be deleted from the top of the table so that no two columns are equal. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 6 dobarz adatak Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 3 4 alfa beta zeta Sample Output 2: 2
