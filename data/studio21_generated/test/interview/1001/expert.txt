 Given two integers n and m, print the difference of scores if both players play optimally. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of stickers, initially located on the wall. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10 000 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10 000) — the numbers on stickers in order from left to right. -----Output----- Print one integer — the difference between the Petya's score and Gena's score at the end of the game if both players play optimally. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 4 8 Output 14 Input 4 1 -7 -2 3 Output -3 -----Note----- In the first sample, the optimal move for Petya is to take all the stickers. As a result, his score will be equal to 14 and Gena's score will be equal to 0. In the second sample, the optimal sequence of moves is the following. On the first move Petya will take first three sticker and will put the new sticker with value  - 8. On the second move Gena will take the remaining two stickers. The Petya's score is 1 + ( - 7) + ( - 2) =  - 8, Gena's score is ( - 8) + 3 =  - 5, i.e. the score difference will be  - 3.
