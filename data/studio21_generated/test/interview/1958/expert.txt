 You are given an array with integers. For each integer in the array print if grandma should sell this integer or not  
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and p (1 ≤ n ≤ 40, 2 ≤ p ≤ 1000) — the number of the buyers and the cost of one apple. It is guaranteed that the number p is even. The next n lines contains the description of buyers. Each buyer is described with the string half if he simply bought half of the apples and with the string halfplus if grandma also gave him a half of an apple as a gift. It is guaranteed that grandma has at least one apple at the start of the day and she has no apples at the end of the day. -----Output----- Print the only integer a — the total money grandma should have at the end of the day. Note that the answer can be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++ you can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer type. -----Examples----- Input 2 10 half halfplus Output 15 Input 3 10 halfplus halfplus halfplus Output 55 -----Note----- In the first sample at the start of the day the grandma had two apples. First she sold one apple and then she sold a half of the second apple and gave a half of the second apple as a present to the second buyer.
