 Given a sequence of $N$ characters, how can you change this sequence to its end state (containing only $A$ characters) in minimum number of mutations. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 1000000$), the length of the molecule. The second line of input contains a string with $N$ characters, with each character being either $A$ or $B$. This string represents the starting state of the molecule. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of mutations. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 ABBA Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 5 BBABB Sample Output 2: 2
