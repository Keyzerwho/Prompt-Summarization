 You are given N values with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) — the degree of the polynomial and the limit for absolute values of coefficients. The second line contains n + 1 integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} (|a_{i}| ≤ k, a_{n} ≠ 0) — describing a valid polynomial $P(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot x^{i}$. It's guaranteed that P(2) ≠ 0. -----Output----- Print the number of ways to change one coefficient to get a valid polynomial Q that Q(2) = 0. -----Examples----- Input 3 1000000000 10 -9 -3 5 Output 3 Input 3 12 10 -9 -3 5 Output 2 Input 2 20 14 -7 19 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample, we are given a polynomial P(x) = 10 - 9x - 3x^2 + 5x^3. Limak can change one coefficient in three ways:  He can set a_0 =  - 10. Then he would get Q(x) =  - 10 - 9x - 3x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) =  - 10 - 18 - 12 + 40 = 0.  Or he can set a_2 =  - 8. Then Q(x) = 10 - 9x - 8x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) = 10 - 18 - 32 + 40 = 0.  Or he can set a_1 =  - 19. Then Q(x) = 10 - 19x - 3x^2 + 5x^3 and indeed Q(2) = 10 - 38 - 12 + 40 = 0.  In the second sample, we are given the same polynomial. This time though, k is equal to 12 instead of 10^9. Two first of ways listed above are still valid but in the third way we would get |a_1| > k what is not allowed. Thus, the answer is 2 this time.
