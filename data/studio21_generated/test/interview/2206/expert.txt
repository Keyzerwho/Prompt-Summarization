 You are given n points (marked points) and n - 1 segments (lines). You need to output how many ways there are to connect all vertices with n - 1 segments. Two ways are considered different iff there exist some pair of points such that a segment is drawn between them in the first way of connection, but it is not drawn between these points in the second one. Since the answer might be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one number n (3 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the number of marked points. Then n lines follow, each containing n elements. a_{i}, j (j-th element of line i) is equal to 1 iff you can connect points i and j directly (otherwise a_{i}, j = 0). It is guaranteed that for any pair of points a_{i}, j = a_{j}, i, and for any point a_{i}, i = 0. -----Output----- Print the number of ways to connect points modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 Output 1 Input 4 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 Output 12 Input 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 Output 0
