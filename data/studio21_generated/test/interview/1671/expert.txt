 
-----Input----- The first line contains positive number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of the servers.  The second line contains the sequence of non-negative integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_{n} (0 ≤ m_{i} ≤ 2·10^4), where m_{i} is the number of tasks assigned to the i-th server. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of seconds required to balance the load. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 6 Output 2 Input 7 10 11 10 11 10 11 11 Output 0 Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example two seconds are needed. In each second, a single task from server #2 should be moved to server #1. After two seconds there should be 3 tasks on server #1 and 4 tasks on server #2. In the second example the load is already balanced. A possible sequence of task movements for the third example is:  move a task from server #4 to server #1 (the sequence m becomes: 2 2 3 3 5);  then move task from server #5 to server #1 (the sequence m becomes: 3 2 3 3 4);  then move task from server #5 to server #2 (the sequence m becomes: 3 3 3 3 3).  The above sequence is one of several possible ways to balance the load of servers in three seconds.
