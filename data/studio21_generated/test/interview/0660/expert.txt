 You are given a list of integers, you need to output the number of towels and bottles needed for the tournament. 
-----Input----- The only line contains three integers n, b, p (1 ≤ n, b, p ≤ 500) — the number of participants and the parameters described in the problem statement. -----Output----- Print two integers x and y — the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 Output 20 15 Input 8 2 4 Output 35 32 -----Note----- In the first example will be three rounds:  in the first round will be two matches and for each match 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one for the judge),  in the second round will be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water,  in the third round will also be only one match, so we need another 5 bottles of water.  So in total we need 20 bottles of water. In the second example no participant will move on to some round directly.
