 Given a sequence of n doors, where $n$ is the number of doors in Mr. Black's house. Find the smallest index $k$ such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first $k$ doors.
-----Input----- The first line contains integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 200\,000$) — the number of doors. The next line contains $n$ integers: the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors. The $i$-th of these integers is equal to $0$ in case the $i$-th opened door is located in the left exit, and it is equal to $1$ in case it is in the right exit. It is guaranteed that there is at least one door located in the left exit and there is at least one door located in the right exit. -----Output----- Print the smallest integer $k$ such that after Mr. Black opened the first $k$ doors, he was able to exit the house. -----Examples----- Input 5 0 0 1 0 0 Output 3 Input 4 1 0 0 1 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example the first two doors are from the left exit, so when Mr. Black opened both of them only, there were two more closed door in the left exit and one closed door in the right exit. So Mr. Black wasn't able to exit at that moment. When he opened the third door, all doors from the right exit became open, so Mr. Black was able to exit the house. In the second example when the first two doors were opened, there was open closed door in each of the exit. With three doors opened Mr. Black was able to use the left exit.
