 You are given $q$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_q$. For each of these integers compute the largest possible value of the greatest common divisor (when $b$ is chosen optimally). 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^3$) — the number of integers you need to compute the answer for. After that $q$ integers are given, one per line: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_q$ ($2 \le a_i \le 2^{25} - 1$) — the integers you need to compute the answer for.  -----Output----- For each integer, print the answer in the same order as the integers are given in input. -----Example----- Input 3 2 3 5 Output 3 1 7 -----Note----- For the first integer the optimal choice is $b = 1$, then $a \oplus b = 3$, $a \> \& \> b = 0$, and the greatest common divisor of $3$ and $0$ is $3$. For the second integer one optimal choice is $b = 2$, then $a \oplus b = 1$, $a \> \& \> b = 2$, and the greatest common divisor of $1$ and $2$ is $1$. For the third integer the optimal choice is $b = 2$, then $a \oplus b = 7$, $a \> \& \> b = 0$, and the greatest common divisor of $7$ and $0$ is $7$.
