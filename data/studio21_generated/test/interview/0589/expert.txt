 You are given a string s, and a number N (30 > N > 0). You need to find the number of possible safe codes to the safe, matching the given hint. 
-----Input----- The first line contains string s — the hint to the safe code. String s consists of the following characters: ?, 0-9, A-J. It is guaranteed that the first character of string s doesn't equal to character 0. The input limits for scoring 30 points are (subproblem A1):   1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5.  The input limits for scoring 100 points are (subproblems A1+A2):   1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5.  Here |s| means the length of string s. -----Output----- Print the number of codes that match the given hint. -----Examples----- Input AJ Output 81 Input 1?AA Output 100
