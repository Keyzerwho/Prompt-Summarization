 You are given street direction patterns. You need to check whether it is possible to reach any junction from any other junction in the proposed street direction pattern. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers n and m, (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 20), denoting the number of horizontal streets and the number of vertical streets. The second line contains a string of length n, made of characters '<' and '>', denoting direction of each horizontal street. If the i-th character is equal to '<', the street is directed from east to west otherwise, the street is directed from west to east. Streets are listed in order from north to south. The third line contains a string of length m, made of characters '^' and 'v', denoting direction of each vertical street. If the i-th character is equal to '^', the street is directed from south to north, otherwise the street is directed from north to south. Streets are listed in order from west to east. -----Output----- If the given pattern meets the mayor's criteria, print a single line containing "YES", otherwise print a single line containing "NO". -----Examples----- Input 3 3 ><> v^v Output NO Input 4 6 <><> v^v^v^ Output YES -----Note----- The figure above shows street directions in the second sample test case.
