 You are given an array of integers. You need to compute the time the cows need to be in place at their temporary location. 
-----Input----- Input consists of three lines. The first line consists of two integers $m$ and $l$, the current positions of the cows. The second line consists of two integers $M$ and $L$, the new positions of the cows. The third line consists of two integers $t_ m$ and $t_ l$, the time at which the two cows will be served their daily meal. It is guaranteed that $-10^8 \leq m, l, M, L \leq 10^8$ and $1 \leq t_ m, t_ l \leq 10^8$. It is also guaranteed that both cows will actually move, i.e., $m \not= M$ and $l \not= L$. -----Output----- Output should consist of a single word. Print “possible” if it is possible to move both cows before they are served their daily meal. Otherwise, print “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: -1 1 -2 2 6 6 Sample Output 1: possible Sample Input 2: -1 1 -2 2 5 5 Sample Output 2: impossible Sample Input 3: -1 1 1 -1 3 5 Sample Output 3: possible
