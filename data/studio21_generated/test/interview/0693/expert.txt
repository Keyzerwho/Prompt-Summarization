 You have n knights. Each knight has a lightsaber of one of m colors. Each knight has k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. You need to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. However, since the last time, you have learned that it is not always possible to select such an interval. Therefore, you decided to ask some knights to go on an indefinite unpaid vacation leave near certain pits on Tatooine, if you know what I mean. Help Heidi decide what is the minimum number of knights that need to be let go before she is able to select the desired interval from the subsequence of remaining knights. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of Jedi Knights with lightsabers of each color from 1 to m. -----Output----- Output one number: the minimum number of Jedi Knights that need to be removed from the sequence so that, in what remains, there is an interval with the prescribed counts of lightsaber colors. If this is not possible, output  - 1. -----Example----- Input 8 3 3 3 1 2 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 Output 1
