 You are given a sequence of integers. You need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of that sequence. Greatest common divisor (gcd) of a sequence of integers is the maximum possible integer so that each element of the sequence is divisible by it. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) — the size of the army. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000000) — denoting the strengths of his soldiers. -----Output----- Print one integer — the strength of John Snow's army modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 3 3 3 1 Output 12 Input 4 2 3 4 6 Output 39 -----Note----- In the first sample the clans are {1}, {2}, {1, 2} so the answer will be 1·3 + 1·3 + 2·3 = 12
