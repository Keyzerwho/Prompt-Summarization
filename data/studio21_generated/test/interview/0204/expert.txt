 Monocarp wants to buy new TV. He has some restrictions. He wants to find optimal resolution. He has tried all variants. He wants to count number of TV having aspect ratio $\frac{x}{y}$, screen width not exceeding $a$, and screen height not exceeding $b$. Two TV are considered different if they have different screen width or different screen height. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ ($1 \le a, b, x, y \le 10^{18}$) — the constraints on the screen width and height, and on the aspect ratio. -----Output----- Print one integer — the number of different variants to choose TV screen width and screen height so that they meet the aforementioned constraints. -----Examples----- Input 17 15 5 3 Output 3 Input 14 16 7 22 Output 0 Input 4 2 6 4 Output 1 Input 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 999999866000004473 999999822000007597 Output 1000000063 -----Note----- In the first example, there are $3$ possible variants: $(5, 3)$, $(10, 6)$, $(15, 9)$. In the second example, there is no TV set meeting the constraints. In the third example, there is only one variant: $(3, 2)$.
