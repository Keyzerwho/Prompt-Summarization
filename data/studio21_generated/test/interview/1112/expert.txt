 You are given a list of integers. Find the original magic square, given the Elephant's notes. 
-----Input----- The first three lines of the input contain the Little Elephant's notes. The first line contains elements of the first row of the magic square. The second line contains the elements of the second row, the third line is for the third row. The main diagonal elements that have been forgotten by the Elephant are represented by zeroes. It is guaranteed that the notes contain exactly three zeroes and they are all located on the main diagonal. It is guaranteed that all positive numbers in the table do not exceed 10^5. -----Output----- Print three lines, in each line print three integers â€” the Little Elephant's magic square. If there are multiple magic squares, you are allowed to print any of them. Note that all numbers you print must be positive and not exceed 10^5. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one magic square that meets the conditions. -----Examples----- Input 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 Output 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Input 0 3 6 5 0 5 4 7 0 Output 6 3 6 5 5 5 4 7 4
