 Given one panel from Kyubeat's music tell Cucumber boy is he able to press all the panels in perfect timing. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the number of panels Cucumber boy can press with his one hand. Next 4 lines contain 4 characters each (digits from 1 to 9, or period) — table of panels. If a digit i was written on the panel, it means the boy has to press that panel in time i. If period was written on the panel, he doesn't have to press that panel. -----Output----- Output "YES" (without quotes), if he is able to press all the panels in perfect timing. If not, output "NO" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 1 .135 1247 3468 5789 Output YES Input 5 ..1. 1111 ..1. ..1. Output YES Input 1 .... 12.1 .2.. .2..

He can press all the panels in timing in time 1, but he cannot press the panels in time 2 in timing with his two hands.
