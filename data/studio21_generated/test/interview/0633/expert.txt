 You are given $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Construct a graph such that: 1. Every vertex has at most one edge 2. Every edge has at most one vertex 3. Every vertex has at most one edge 4. Every edge has at most one vertex 5. Every vertex has at most one edge 6. Every vertex has at most one edge 7. Every vertex has at most one edge 8. Every vertex has at most one edge 9. Every vertex has at most one edge 10. Every vertex has at most one edge 11. Every vertex has at most one edge 12. Every vertex has at most one edge 13. Every vertex has at most one edge 14. Every vertex has at most one edge 15. Every vertex has at most one edge 16. Every vertex has at most one edge 17. Every vertex has at most one edge 18. Every vertex has at most one edge 19. Every vertex has at most one edge 20. Every vertex has at most one edge 21. Every
-----Input----- The only line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^5$) â€” the number of vertices and the number of edges. -----Output----- If there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output "Impossible". Otherwise print the answer in the following format: The first line should contain the word "Possible". The $i$-th of the next $m$ lines should contain the $i$-th edge $(v_i, u_i)$ of the resulting graph ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n, v_i \neq u_i$). For each pair $(v, u)$ there can be no more pairs $(v, u)$ or $(u, v)$. The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. If there are multiple answers then print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 6 Output Possible 2 5 3 2 5 1 3 4 4 1 5 4 Input 6 12 Output Impossible -----Note----- Here is the representation of the graph from the first example: [Image]
