 You are given two integers $n$ and $m$. Create a tree numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to calculate the following sum: $$\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l, r) $$ 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq n$) — the values of the vertices. -----Output----- Print one number — the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 3 Output 7 Input 4 2 1 1 3 Output 11 Input 10 1 5 2 5 5 3 10 6 5 1 Output 104 -----Note----- In the first example, the function values ​​will be as follows:   $f(1, 1)=1$ (there is only a vertex with the number $2$, which forms one component)  $f(1, 2)=1$ (there are vertices $1$ and $2$ that form one component)  $f(1, 3)=1$ (all vertices remain, one component is obtained)  $f(2, 2)=1$ (only vertex number $1$)  $f(2, 3)=2$ (there are vertices $1$ and $3$ that form two components)  $f(3, 3)=1$ (only vertex $3$)  Totally out $7$. In the second example, the function values ​​will be as follows:   $f(1, 1)=1$  $f(1, 2)=1$  $f(1, 3)=1$  $f(1, 4)=1$  $f(2, 2)=1$  $f(2, 3)=2$  $f(2, 4)=2$  $f(3, 3)=1$  $f(3, 4)=1$  $f(4, 4)=0$ (there is no vertex left, so the number of components is $0$)  Totally out $11$.
