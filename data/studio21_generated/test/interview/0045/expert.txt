 Given an integer number n, return k positive integers such that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal. 
-----Input----- The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10). -----Output----- If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 6 3 Output 1 2 3 Input 8 2 Output 2 6 Input 5 3 Output -1
