 You are given $n$ flowers in a row. You need to arrange them so that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1\leq n, m\leq 10^3$) — the number of flowers and visitors respectively. Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1\leq l_i\leq r_i\leq n$), meaning that $i$-th visitor will visit all flowers from $l_i$ to $r_i$ inclusive. -----Output----- Print the string of $n$ characters. The $i$-th symbol should be «0» if you want to put a rose in the $i$-th position, otherwise «1» if you want to put a lily. If there are multiple answers, print any. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 1 3 2 4 2 5 Output 01100 Input 6 3 5 6 1 4 4 6 Output 110010 -----Note----- In the first example, Sonya can put roses in the first, fourth, and fifth positions, and lilies in the second and third positions;   in the segment $[1\ldots3]$, there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to $1\cdot 2=2$;  in the segment $[2\ldots4]$, there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to $1\cdot 2=2$;  in the segment $[2\ldots5]$, there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to $2\cdot 2=4$.  The total beauty is equal to $2+2+4=8$. In the second example, Sonya can put roses in the third, fourth, and sixth positions, and lilies in the first, second, and fifth positions;   in the segment $[5\ldots6]$, there are one rose and one lily, so the beauty is equal to $1\cdot 1=1$;  in the segment $[1\ldots4]$, there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to $2\cdot 2=4$;  in the segment $[4\ldots6]$, there are two roses and one lily, so the beauty is equal to $2\cdot 1=2$.  The total beauty is equal to $1+4+2=7$.
