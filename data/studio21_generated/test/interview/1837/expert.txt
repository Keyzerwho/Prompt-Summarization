 You are given a permutation a. You are allowed at most one swap of two elements. Your task is to maximize the number of fixed points in the resulting permutation. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n} - 1 — the given permutation. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of fixed points in the permutation after at most one swap operation. -----Examples----- Input 5 0 1 3 4 2 Output 3
