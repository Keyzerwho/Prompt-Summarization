 Given an array of integers, return the sum of two cards that add up to a given sum. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, $n$, the number of cards, and $s$, the desired sum. The second line will contain $n$ integers between $1$ and $100000000$ inclusive. You may assume that $1\leq n\leq 100000$ and $2\leq s\leq 200000000$. -----Output----- The output should be a single line consisting of the string YES if two cards can be chosen such that (in some orientation) they add up to $s$, and the string NO otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 66 15 21 22 Sample Output: NO
