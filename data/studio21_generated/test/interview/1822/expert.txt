 You are given an array with length $n$. Find the maximum number of people that can be in the queue. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) — the number of beavers that stand in the queue and the Smart Beaver's number, correspondingly. All willing to get to the doctor are numbered from 1 to n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n) — the number of the beaver followed by the i-th beaver. If a_{i} = 0, then the i-th beaver doesn't know who is should be in front of him. It is guaranteed that values a_{i} are correct. That is there is no cycles in the dependencies. And any beaver is followed by at most one beaver in the queue. The input limits for scoring 30 points are (subproblem B1):   It is guaranteed that the number of zero elements a_{i} doesn't exceed 20.  The input limits for scoring 100 points are (subproblems B1+B2):   The number of zero elements a_{i} is arbitrary.  -----Output----- Print all possible positions of the Smart Beaver in the line in the increasing order. -----Examples----- Input 6 1 2 0 4 0 6 0 Output 2 4 6 Input 6 2 2 3 0 5 6 0 Output 2 5 Input 4 1 0 0 0 0 Output 1 2 3 4 Input 6 2 0 0 1 0 4 5 Output 1 3 4 6 -----Note----- [Image]  Picture for the fourth test.
