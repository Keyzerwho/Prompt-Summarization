 There were $n$ values of A and B arranged in a list. You should start at the middle of the list. $n$ values to the left and $n$ values to the right. You can choose to make a value zero from either the first non-zero value to left or the first non-zero value to right. Finally, at the end the number of A's and B's should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.  Jars are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $n$ and $n+1$. What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left  Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$ — the number of ice spheres in the shop. The second line contains $n$ different integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — the prices of ice spheres. -----Output----- In the first line print the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy. In the second line print the prices of ice spheres in the optimal order. If there are several correct answers, you can print any of them. -----Example----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 2 3 1 4 2 5  -----Note----- In the example it's not possible to place ice spheres in any order so that Sage would buy $3$ of them. If the ice spheres are placed like this $(3, 1, 4, 2, 5)$, then Sage will buy two spheres: one for $1$ and one for $2$, because they are cheap.
