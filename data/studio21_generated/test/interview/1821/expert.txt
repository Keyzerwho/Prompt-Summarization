 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5000). The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5) — notes written on a sheet. -----Output----- Print maximum sum of lengths of such two non-empty non-intersecting subsequences that both of them form a melody. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 4 5 Output 4 Input 6 62 22 60 61 48 49 Output 5 -----Note----- In the first example subsequences [1, 2] and [4, 5] give length 4 in total. In the second example subsequences [62, 48, 49] and [60, 61] give length 5 in total. If you choose subsequence [62, 61] in the first place then the second melody will have maximum length 2, that gives the result of 4, which is not maximal.
