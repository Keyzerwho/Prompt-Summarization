 You are given a room of size a square meters. n students want to live there. The caretaker can enlarge any (possibly both) side of the room by an arbitrary positive integer of meters. Help him change the room so as all n students could live in it and the total area of the room was as small as possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three space-separated integers n, a and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of students and the sizes of the room. -----Output----- Print three integers s, a_1 and b_1 (a ≤ a_1; b ≤ b_1) — the final area of the room and its sizes. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 5 Output 18 3 6 Input 2 4 4 Output 16 4 4
