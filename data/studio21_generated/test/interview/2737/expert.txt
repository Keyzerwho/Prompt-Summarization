 You are given a network of $n$ locations at which people live, connected by $m$ bidirectional roads. You are given a shelter capacity of $s$. You need to find the minimum amount of time it takes for everyone to arrive at a shelter, when we assign people to shelters optimally. 
-----Input-----  - On the first line are three integers, the number of locations $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, roads $0 \leq m \leq 2\cdot 10^5$, and shelters $1 \leq s \leq 10$.  - Then follows a line with $n$ integers $0 \leq p_ i \leq 10^9$, indicating the the number of people living at location $1 \leq i \leq n$.  - Then follow $m$ lines containing three integers $1 \leq u, v \leq n$ and $1 \leq w \leq 10^9$ indicating that there is a bidirectional road connecting $u$ and $v$ that takes $w$ time to traverse. For any two locations there is at most one road connecting them directly, and no road connects a location to itself.  - Finally follow $s$ lines with two integers $1 \leq s_ i \leq n$ and $1 \leq c_ i \leq 10^9$, indicating that there is a shelter with capacity $c_ i$ at location $s_ i$. -----Output----- Print the minimum amount of time it takes to shelter everyone. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 1 3 2 1 2 4 1 6 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 4 5 2 2 0 0 2 1 2 6 1 3 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 2 6 3 2 2 2 Sample Output 2: 5 Sample Input 3: 7 8 3 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 1 1 4 6 5 4 3 1 6 7 10 7 5 3 5 6 3 6 5 1 1 2 1 Sample Output 3: 6
