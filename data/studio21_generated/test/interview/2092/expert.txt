 You are given 3 integers $a_i$, $l_i$, $r_i$ for each trap. You need to find maximum number of soldiers such that they all can be brought from 0 to n in no more than t seconds
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers $m$, $n$, $k$ and $t$ ($1 \le m, n, k, t \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n < t$) — the number of soldiers, the number of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps and the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the boss, respectively. The second line contains $m$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_m$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the agility of the $i$-th soldier. Then $k$ lines follow, containing the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $d_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$, $1 \le d_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the location of the trap, the location where the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively. -----Output----- Print one integer — the maximum number of soldiers you may choose so that you may bring them all to the boss in no more than $t$ seconds. -----Example----- Input 5 6 4 14 1 2 3 4 5 1 5 2 1 2 5 2 3 5 3 5 3 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example you may take soldiers with agility $3$, $4$ and $5$ with you. The course of action is as follows:   go to $2$ without your squad;  disarm the trap $2$;  go to $3$ without your squad;  disartm the trap $3$;  go to $0$ without your squad;  go to $7$ with your squad.  The whole plan can be executed in $13$ seconds.
