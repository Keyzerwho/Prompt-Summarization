 You are given a list of n integers. For each integer, print its color. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of dancers and the number of dances, correspondingly. Then m lines follow, describing the dances in the order of dancing them. The i-th line contains three distinct integers — the numbers of the dancers that take part in the i-th dance. The dancers are numbered from 1 to n. Each dancer takes part in at least one dance. -----Output----- Print n space-separated integers: the i-th number must represent the color of the i-th dancer's clothes (1 for white, 2 for red, 3 for blue). If there are multiple valid solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. -----Examples----- Input 7 3 1 2 3 1 4 5 4 6 7 Output 1 2 3 3 2 2 1  Input 9 3 3 6 9 2 5 8 1 4 7 Output 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3  Input 5 2 4 1 5 3 1 2 Output 2 3 1 1 3
