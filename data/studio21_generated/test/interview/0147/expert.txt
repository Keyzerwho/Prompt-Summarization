 You are given 2 costs c_0 and c_1. You need to come up with an alphabet (with properties as above) with minimum total cost. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), c_0 and c_1 (0 ≤ c_0, c_1 ≤ 10^8) — the number of letters in the alphabet, and costs of '0' and '1', respectively.  -----Output----- Output a single integer — minimum possible total a cost of the whole alphabet. -----Example----- Input 4 1 2 Output 12 -----Note----- There are 4 letters in the alphabet. The optimal encoding is "00", "01", "10", "11". There are 4 zeroes and 4 ones used, so the total cost is 4·1 + 4·2 = 12.
