 Heidi has a list of universes. Each time she makes a decision, she wants to know how many universes there are and where the doctor is. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers $n$, $k$, $m$ and $t$ ($2 \le k \le n \le m \le 250$, $1 \le t \le 1000$). Each of the following $t$ lines is in one of the following formats:   "$1$ $i$" — meaning that a universe is inserted at the position $i$ ($1 \le i \le l + 1$), where $l$ denotes the current length of the multiverse.  "$0$ $i$" — meaning that the $i$-th link is broken ($1 \le i \le l - 1$), where $l$ denotes the current length of the multiverse.  -----Output----- Output $t$ lines. Each line should contain $l$, the current length of the multiverse and $k$, the current position of the Doctor. It is guaranteed that the sequence of the steps will be valid, i.e. the multiverse will have length at most $m$ and when the link breaking is performed, there will be at least one universe in the multiverse. -----Example----- Input 5 2 10 4 0 1 1 1 0 4 1 2 Output 4 1 5 2 4 2 5 3 -----Note----- The multiverse initially consisted of 5 universes, with the Doctor being in the second. First, link 1 was broken, leaving the multiverse with 4 universes, and the Doctor in the first. Then, a universe was added to the leftmost end of the multiverse, increasing the multiverse length to 5, and the Doctor was then in the second universe. Then, the rightmost link was broken. Finally, a universe was added between the first and the second universe.
