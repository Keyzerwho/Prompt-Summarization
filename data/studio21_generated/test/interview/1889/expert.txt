 You are given n and m, the number of rows and columns in the grid. You are also given q, the number of rounds. For each round, you are asked to find the number of consecutive bears with hands on their eyes in that row. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers n, m and q (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 5000). The next n lines contain the grid description. There are m integers separated by spaces in each line. Each of these numbers is either 0 (for mouth) or 1 (for eyes). The next q lines contain the information about the rounds. Each of them contains two integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m), the row number and the column number of the bear changing his state. -----Output----- After each round, print the current score of the bears. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 5 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 2 4 3 Output 3 4 3 3 4
