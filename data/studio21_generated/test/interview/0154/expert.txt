 You are given an integer $n$. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices that have distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive. Output this number modulo $998\,244\,353$. 
-----Input----- The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), denoting the required number of vertices. -----Output----- Output the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees with $n$ vertices and distinct integer keys between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, modulo $998\,244\,353$. -----Examples----- Input 4 Output 1 Input 3 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example, this is the only tree that satisfies the conditions: $\left. \begin{array}{l}{\text{perfectly balanced}} \\{\text{striped}} \\{\text{binary search tree}} \end{array} \right.$ In the second example, here are various trees that don't satisfy some condition: [Image]
