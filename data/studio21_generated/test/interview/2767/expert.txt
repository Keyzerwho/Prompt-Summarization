 You are given a dictionary of $N$ words. You need to calculate how many different test sentences can be made out of those words. Every word from the dictionary can be used only once in the sentence and the order of the words in the sentence is irrelevant (i.e.  uvijek jedem sarmu  and  jedem sarmu uvijek  are equal sentences). 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 25)$, the number of words in the dictionary. Each of the following $N$ lines contains a single word from the dictionary, its length not exceeding 100. All the words from the dictionary are going to be unique. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the task. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 9 the quick brown fox jumps over a sleazy dog Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 3 a b c Sample Output 2: 0
