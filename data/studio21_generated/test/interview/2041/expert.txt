 You are given a sequence of integers $a=[a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n]$ of length $n$. Its subsequence is obtained by removing zero or more elements from the sequence $a$ (they do not necessarily go consecutively). For example, for the sequence $a=[11,20,11,33,11,20,11]$:  $[11,20,11,33,11,20,11]$, $[11,20,11,33,11,20]$, $[11,11,11,11]$, $[20]$, $[33,20]$ are subsequences (these are just some of the long list);  $[40]$, $[33,33]$, $[33,20,20]$, $[20,20,11,11]$ are not subsequences.  Suppose that an additional non-negative integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le n$) is given, then the subsequence is called optimal if:  it has a length of $k$ and the sum of
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the length of the sequence $a$. The second line contains elements of the sequence $a$: integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$). The third line contains an integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 2\cdot10^5$) — the number of requests. The following $m$ lines contain pairs of integers $k_j$ and $pos_j$ ($1 \le k \le n$, $1 \le pos_j \le k_j$) — the requests. -----Output----- Print $m$ integers $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_m$ ($1 \le r_j \le 10^9$) one per line: answers to the requests in the order they appear in the input. The value of $r_j$ should be equal to the value contained in the position $pos_j$ of the optimal subsequence for $k=k_j$. -----Examples----- Input 3 10 20 10 6 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 3 3 Output 20 10 20 10 20 10 Input 7 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 9 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 3 3 1 1 7 1 7 7 7 4 Output 2 3 2 3 2 3 1 1 3 -----Note----- In the first example, for $a=[10,20,10]$ the optimal subsequences are:   for $k=1$: $[20]$,  for $k=2$: $[10,20]$,  for $k=3$: $[10,20,10]$.
