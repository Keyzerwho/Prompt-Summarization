 You are given a grid of size $n \times n$ with some obstacles marked on it. Your task is to count the different ways the robot could go from the top left corner $s$ to the bottom right $t$, and if none, test if it were possible if it could walk up and left as well.
-----Input----- On the first line is one integer, $1 \leq n \leq 1000$. Then follows $n$ lines, each with $n$ characters, where each character is one of ’.’ and ’#’, where ’.’ is to be interpreted as a walkable tile and ’#’ as a non-walkable tile. There will never be a wall at $s$, and there will never be a wall at $t$. -----Output----- Output one line with the number of different paths starting in $s$ and ending in $t$ (modulo $2^{31} - 1$) or THE GAME IS A LIE if you cannot go from $s$ to $t$ going only rightwards and downwards but you can if you are allowed to go left and up as well, or INCONCEIVABLE if there simply is no path from $s$ to $t$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 ..... #..#. #..#. ...#. ..... Sample Output: 6
