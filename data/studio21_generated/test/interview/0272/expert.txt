 You are given a pattern and a string. You need to find the number of pairs of keys that could be mixed. Each key must occur in pairs at most once. 
-----Input----- The input consists of only two strings s and t denoting the favorite Santa's patter and the resulting string. s and t are not empty and have the same length, which is at most 1000. Both strings consist only of lowercase English letters. -----Output----- If Santa is wrong, and there is no way to divide some of keys into pairs and swap keys in each pair so that the keyboard will be fixed, print «-1» (without quotes). Otherwise, the first line of output should contain the only integer k (k ≥ 0) — the number of pairs of keys that should be swapped. The following k lines should contain two space-separated letters each, denoting the keys which should be swapped. All printed letters must be distinct. If there are several possible answers, print any of them. You are free to choose the order of the pairs and the order of keys in a pair. Each letter must occur at most once. Santa considers the keyboard to be fixed if he can print his favorite patter without mistakes. -----Examples----- Input helloworld ehoolwlroz Output 3 h e l o d z Input hastalavistababy hastalavistababy Output 0 Input merrychristmas christmasmerry Output -1
