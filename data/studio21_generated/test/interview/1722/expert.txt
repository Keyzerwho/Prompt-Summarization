 You are given the list of the $n$ names. What is the minimum $x$ we can obtain by splitting the students into classrooms  Note that it is valid to place all of the students in one of the classrooms, leaving the other one empty. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\leq n \leq 100$) — the number of students. After this $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains the name of the $i$-th student. It is guaranteed each name is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most $20$. Note that multiple students may share the same name. -----Output----- The output must consist of a single integer $x$ — the minimum possible number of chatty pairs. -----Examples----- Input 4 jorge jose oscar jerry Output 1 Input 7 kambei gorobei shichiroji kyuzo heihachi katsushiro kikuchiyo Output 2 Input 5 mike mike mike mike mike Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample the minimum number of pairs is $1$. This can be achieved, for example, by putting everyone except jose in one classroom, and jose in the other, so jorge and jerry form the only chatty pair. In the second sample the minimum number of pairs is $2$. This can be achieved, for example, by putting kambei, gorobei, shichiroji and kyuzo in one room and putting heihachi, katsushiro and kikuchiyo in the other room. In this case the two pairs are kambei and kyuzo, and katsushiro and kikuchiyo. In the third sample the minimum number of pairs is $4$. This can be achieved by placing three of the students named mike in one classroom and the other two students in another classroom. Thus there will be three chatty pairs in one classroom and one chatty pair in the other classroom.
