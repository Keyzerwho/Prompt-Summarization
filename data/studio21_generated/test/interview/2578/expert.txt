 You are given a list of users (users can be of different types), and for each user $x$ you have to determine what is the number of users that will know the news if initially only user $x$ starts distributing it. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of users and the number of groups of friends, respectively. Then $m$ lines follow, each describing a group of friends. The $i$-th line begins with integer $k_i$ ($0 \le k_i \le n$) — the number of users in the $i$-th group. Then $k_i$ distinct integers follow, denoting the users belonging to the $i$-th group. It is guaranteed that $\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{m} k_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- Print $n$ integers. The $i$-th integer should be equal to the number of users that will know the news if user $i$ starts distributing it. -----Example----- Input 7 5 3 2 5 4 0 2 1 2 1 1 2 6 7 Output 4 4 1 4 4 2 2
