 You are given an array of integers. Find all the segments, if any, that can be formed from the given array. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket. The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces. -----Output----- If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive). -----Examples----- Input 5 73452 Output YES Input 4 1248 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$. In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
