 You are given an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. You need to add signs "+" and "-" before each number so that the value of expression s meets the limits 0   s   a_1. Print the sequence of signs "+" and "-", satisfying the given limits. It is guaranteed that the solution for the problem exists. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of the array. The second line contains space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the original array.  It is guaranteed that the condition a_{i} ≤ a_{i} + 1 ≤ 2·a_{i} fulfills for any positive integer i (i < n). -----Output----- In a single line print the sequence of n characters "+" and "-", where the i-th character is the sign that is placed in front of number a_{i}. The value of the resulting expression s must fit into the limits 0 ≤ s ≤ a_1. If there are multiple solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 3 5 Output +++- Input 3 3 3 5 Output ++-
