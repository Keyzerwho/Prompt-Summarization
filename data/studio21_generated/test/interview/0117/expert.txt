 you are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order  
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M A_1 B_1 C_1 : A_N B_N C_N D_1 E_1 F_1 : D_M E_M F_M -----Output----- If the area of the region the cow can reach is infinite, print INF; otherwise, print an integer representing the area in \mathrm{cm^2}. (Under the constraints, it can be proved that the area of the region is always an integer if it is not infinite.) -----Sample Input----- 5 6 1 2 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 -3 4 -1 -2 6 3 1 0 1 0 1 2 2 0 2 -1 -4 5 3 -2 4 1 2 4 -----Sample Output----- 13 The area of the region the cow can reach is 13\ \mathrm{cm^2}.
