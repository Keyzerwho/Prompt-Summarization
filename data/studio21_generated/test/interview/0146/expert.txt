 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $k$. Close every $k$-th element. Calculate the amount of remaining elements with information for test and amount of remaining social network elements. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k < n \leq 100$) — the amount of tabs opened currently and the distance between the tabs closed. The second line consists of $n$ integers, each of them equal either to $1$ or to $-1$. The $i$-th integer denotes the type of the $i$-th tab: if it is equal to $1$, this tab contains information for the test, and if it is equal to $-1$, it's a social network tab. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the maximum absolute difference between the amounts of remaining tabs of different types $|e - s|$. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 1 1 -1 1 Output 2 Input 14 3 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 Output 9 -----Note----- In the first example we can choose $b = 1$ or $b = 3$. We will delete then one tab of each type and the remaining tabs are then all contain test information. Thus, $e = 2$ and $s = 0$ and $|e - s| = 2$. In the second example, on the contrary, we can leave opened only tabs that have social networks opened in them.
