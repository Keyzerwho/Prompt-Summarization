 You are given two non-negative integers l and r. Your goal is to figure out if l and r are unlucky. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four integer numbers x, y, l and r (2 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^18). -----Output----- Print the maximum length of The Golden Age within the interval [l, r]. If all years in the interval [l, r] are unlucky then print 0. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 1 10 Output 1 Input 3 5 10 22 Output 8 Input 2 3 3 5 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example the unlucky years are 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 10. So maximum length of The Golden Age is achived in the intervals [1, 1], [6, 6] and [8, 8]. In the second example the longest Golden Age is the interval [15, 22].
