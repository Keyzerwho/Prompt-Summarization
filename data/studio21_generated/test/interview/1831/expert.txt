 =====Problem Statement===== You are given a zombie nervous system. Analyze the zombie nervous system and find out whether it is valid. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to n) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively. In the next m lines, descriptions of brain connectors follow. Every connector is given as a pair of brains a b it connects (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, a ≠ b). -----Output----- The output consists of one line, containing either yes or no depending on whether the nervous system is valid. -----Examples----- Input 4 4 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 1 Output no Input 6 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 3 6 Output yes
