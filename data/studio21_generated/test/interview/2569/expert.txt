 Lee has a rooted dead bush of level n. He can move a claw in his bush if all vertices in the claw are green and all vertices of the claw are children of its center. He'd like to know the maximum number of yellow vertices he can achieve. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain test cases — one per line. The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^6$) — the level of Lee's RDB. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of yellow vertices Lee can make modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Example----- Input 7 1 2 3 4 5 100 2000000 Output 0 0 4 4 12 990998587 804665184 -----Note----- It's easy to see that the answer for RDB of level $1$ or $2$ is $0$. The answer for RDB of level $3$ is $4$ since there is only one claw we can choose: $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. The answer for RDB of level $4$ is $4$ since we can choose either single claw $\{1, 3, 2, 4\}$ or single claw $\{2, 7, 5, 6\}$. There are no other claws in the RDB of level $4$ (for example, we can't choose $\{2, 1, 7, 6\}$, since $1$ is not a child of center vertex $2$).  $\therefore$ Rooted Dead Bush of level 4.
