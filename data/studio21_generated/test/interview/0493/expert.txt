 You are given the initial directions Chris has pushed the dominoes. You need to find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically at the end of the process! 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a character string s of length n. The i-th character of the string s_{i} is equal to   "L", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left;  "R", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right;  ".", if the i-th domino has not been pushed.  It is guaranteed that if s_{i} = s_{j} = "L" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and s_{k} = "R"; if s_{i} = s_{j} = "R" and i < j, then there exists such k that i < k < j and s_{k} = "L". -----Output----- Output a single integer, the number of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process. -----Examples----- Input 14 .L.R...LR..L.. Output 4 Input 5 R.... Output 0 Input 1 . Output 1 -----Note----- The first example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces that remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange. In the second example case, all pieces fall down since the first piece topples all the other pieces. In the last example case, a single piece has not been pushed in either direction.
