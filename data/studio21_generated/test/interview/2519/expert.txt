 You are given an array of $n$ integers. You are asked to find the maximum possible value of expected value of sum of all numbers. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N K p_1 ... p_N -----Output----- Print the maximum possible value of the expected value of the sum of the numbers shown. Your output will be considered correct when its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}. -----Sample Input----- 5 3 1 2 2 4 5 -----Sample Output----- 7.000000000000 When we throw the third, fourth, and fifth dice from the left, the expected value of the sum of the numbers shown is 7. This is the maximum value we can achieve.
