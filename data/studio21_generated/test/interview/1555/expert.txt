 You are given a table $a$ of size $n \times m$, in which Mr. Apple described his impressions. If, according to the expert, dish $i$ from the first set was better than dish $j$ from the second set, then $a_{ij}$ is equal to ">", in the opposite case $a_{ij}$ is equal to "<". Dishes also may be equally good, in this case $a_{ij}$ is "=". Now Mr. Apple wants you to help him to evaluate every dish. Since Mr. Apple is very strict, he will evaluate the dishes so that the maximal number used is as small as possible. But Mr. Apple also is very fair, so he never evaluates the dishes so that it goes against his feelings. In other words, if $a_{ij}$ is "<", then the number assigned to dish $i$ from the first set should be less than the number of dish $j$ from the second set, if $a_{ij}$ is ">", then it should be greater, and finally if $a_{ij}$ is "=", then the numbers should be the same. Help Mr. Apple to evaluate each dish from both sets so that it is consistent with his feelings, or determine that this
-----Input----- The first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 1000$) — the number of dishes in both days. Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string of $m$ symbols. The $j$-th symbol on $i$-th line is $a_{ij}$. All strings consist only of "<", ">" and "=". -----Output----- The first line of output should contain "Yes", if it's possible to do a correct evaluation for all the dishes, or "No" otherwise. If case an answer exist, on the second line print $n$ integers — evaluations of dishes from the first set, and on the third line print $m$ integers — evaluations of dishes from the second set. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 >>>> >>>> >>>> Output Yes 2 2 2  1 1 1 1  Input 3 3 >>> <<< >>> Output Yes 3 1 3  2 2 2  Input 3 2 == =< == Output No -----Note----- In the first sample, all dishes of the first day are better than dishes of the second day. So, the highest score will be $2$, for all dishes of the first day. In the third sample, the table is contradictory — there is no possible evaluation of the dishes that satisfies it.
