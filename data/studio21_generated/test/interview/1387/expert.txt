 You are given n cells numbered by integers from 1 to n. You are standing at cell 1 and you want to go to cell t. However, you don't know whether it is possible to go there. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^4) and t (2 ≤ t ≤ n) — the number of cells, and the index of the cell which I want to go to. The second line contains n - 1 space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n - i). It is guaranteed, that using the given transportation system, one cannot leave the Line World. -----Output----- If I can go to cell t using the transportation system, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO". -----Examples----- Input 8 4 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 Output YES Input 8 5 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample, the visited cells are: 1, 2, 4; so we can successfully visit the cell 4. In the second sample, the possible cells to visit are: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8; so we can't visit the cell 5, which we want to visit.
