 You are given a list of names. Sort by their name. Can the lexicographical order of the handles be exactly equal to the given permutation?
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of people. The next n lines each contains two strings. The i-th line contains strings f_{i} and s_{i} (1 ≤ |f_{i}|, |s_{i}| ≤ 50) — the first name and last name of the i-th person. Each string consists only of lowercase English letters. All of the given 2n strings will be distinct. The next line contains n distinct integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- If it is possible, output "YES", otherwise output "NO". -----Examples----- Input 3 gennady korotkevich petr mitrichev gaoyuan chen 1 2 3 Output NO Input 3 gennady korotkevich petr mitrichev gaoyuan chen 3 1 2 Output YES Input 2 galileo galilei nicolaus copernicus 2 1 Output YES Input 10 rean schwarzer fei claussell alisa reinford eliot craig laura arseid jusis albarea machias regnitz sara valestin emma millstein gaius worzel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Output NO Input 10 rean schwarzer fei claussell alisa reinford eliot craig laura arseid jusis albarea machias regnitz sara valestin emma millstein gaius worzel 2 4 9 6 5 7 1 3 8 10 Output YES -----Note----- In example 1 and 2, we have 3 people: tourist, Petr and me (cgy4ever). You can see that whatever handle is chosen, I must be the first, then tourist and Petr must be the last. In example 3, if Copernicus uses "copernicus" as his handle, everything will be alright.
