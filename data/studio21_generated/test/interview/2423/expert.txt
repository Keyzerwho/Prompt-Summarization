 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000) – the number of planets in the galaxy. The next N - 1 lines describe the hyperspace tunnels between the planets. Each of the N - 1 lines contains two space-separated integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N) indicating that there is a bidirectional hyperspace tunnel between the planets u and v. It is guaranteed that every two planets are connected by a path of tunnels, and that each tunnel connects a different pair of planets. -----Output----- A single integer denoting the number of remote planets. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 1 4 2 1 3 1 5 Output 3 Input 4 1 2 4 3 1 4 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example, only planets 2, 3 and 5 are connected by a single tunnel. In the second example, the remote planets are 2 and 3. Note that this problem has only two versions – easy and medium.
