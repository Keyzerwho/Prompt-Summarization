 You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: r_1 c_1 r_2 c_2 -----Output----- Print the sum of f(i, j) modulo (10^9+7). -----Sample Input----- 1 1 2 2 -----Sample Output----- 14 For example, there are two paths from the point (0, 0) to the point (1, 1): (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) and (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1), so f(1,1)=2. Similarly, f(1,2)=3, f(2,1)=3, and f(2,2)=6. Thus, the sum is 14.
