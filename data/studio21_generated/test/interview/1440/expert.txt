 You are given $n$ sticks where each stick is of length $2^k$. On each day, you must add a stick of length $2^{k+1}$ to Pavel's collection. Find the maximum number of sticks Pavel can have at the end of $n$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 300\,000$) — the number of different lengths of sticks. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_0$, $a_1$, ..., $a_{n-1}$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the number of sticks with the length equal to $2^i$. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum possible number of non-degenerate triangles that Pavel can make. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 2 2 2 Output 3 Input 3 1 1 1 Output 0 Input 3 3 3 3 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example, Pavel can, for example, make this set of triangles (the lengths of the sides of the triangles are listed): $(2^0, 2^4, 2^4)$, $(2^1, 2^3, 2^3)$, $(2^1, 2^2, 2^2)$. In the second example, Pavel cannot make a single triangle. In the third example, Pavel can, for example, create this set of triangles (the lengths of the sides of the triangles are listed): $(2^0, 2^0, 2^0)$, $(2^1, 2^1, 2^1)$, $(2^2, 2^2, 2^2)$.
