 You are given a list of instructions for each core within m cycles. You need to write a program to simulate the processor for a given set of instructions for each core within m cycles. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 100). Then follow n lines describing instructions. The i-th line contains m integers: x_{i}1, x_{i}2, ..., x_{im} (0 ≤ x_{ij} ≤ k), where x_{ij} is the instruction that must be executed by the i-th core at the j-th cycle. If x_{ij} equals 0, then the corresponding instruction is «do nothing». But if x_{ij} is a number from 1 to k, then the corresponding instruction is «write information to the memory cell number x_{ij}». We assume that the cores are numbered from 1 to n, the work cycles are numbered from 1 to m and the memory cells are numbered from 1 to k. -----Output----- Print n lines. In the i-th line print integer t_{i}. This number should be equal to 0 if the i-th core won't be locked, or it should be equal to the number of the cycle when this core will be locked. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 5 1 0 0 1 0 2 2 3 1 3 2 0 Output 1 1 3 0 Input 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 Output 1 1 0 Input 1 1 1 0 Output 0
