 Given a list of n bricks, find the number of ways to select 1 to n bricks such that a wall is constructed. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n and C, 1 ≤ n ≤ 500000, 1 ≤ C ≤ 200000. -----Output----- Print the number of different walls that Heidi could build, modulo 10^6 + 3. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 Output 5 Input 2 2 Output 5 Input 3 2 Output 9 Input 11 5 Output 4367 Input 37 63 Output 230574 -----Note----- The number 10^6 + 3 is prime. In the second sample case, the five walls are:              B        B B., .B, BB, B., and .B In the third sample case, the nine walls are the five as in the second sample case and in addition the following four:  B    B B    B  B        B B., .B, BB, and BB
