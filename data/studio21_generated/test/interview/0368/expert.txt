-----Input----- The input contains eight lines, eight characters each — the board's description. The white pieces on the board are marked with uppercase letters, the black pieces are marked with lowercase letters. The white pieces are denoted as follows: the queen is represented is 'Q', the rook — as 'R', the bishop — as'B', the knight — as 'N', the pawn — as 'P', the king — as 'K'. The black pieces are denoted as 'q', 'r', 'b', 'n', 'p', 'k', respectively. An empty square of the board is marked as '.' (a dot).  It is not guaranteed that the given chess position can be achieved in a real game. Specifically, there can be an arbitrary (possibly zero) number pieces of each type, the king may be under attack and so on. -----Output----- Print "White" (without quotes) if the weight of the position of the white pieces is more than the weight of the position of the black pieces, print "Black" if the weight of the black pieces is more than the weight of the white pieces and print "Draw" if the weights of the white and black pieces are equal. -----Examples----- Input ...QK... ........ ........ ........ ........ ........ ........ ...rk...
