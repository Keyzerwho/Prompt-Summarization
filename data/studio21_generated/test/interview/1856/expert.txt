Next $n$ lines contains passwords from the list – non-empty strings $s_i$, with length at most $50$ letters. Some of the passwords may be equal. It is guaranteed that the total length of all passwords does not exceed $10^6$ letters. All of them consist only of lowercase Latin letters. -----Output----- In a single line print the minimal number of passwords, the use of which will allow guaranteed to access the system. -----Examples----- Input 4 a b ab d Output 2 Input 3 ab bc abc Output 1 Input 1 codeforces Output 1 -----Note----- In the second example hacker need to use any of the passwords to access the system.
