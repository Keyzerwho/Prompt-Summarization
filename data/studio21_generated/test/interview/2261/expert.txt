 You are given two vectors in 2-dimensional space. You need to find 4 vectors in 4-dimensional space, such that every coordinate of every vector is 1 or -1 and any two vectors are orthogonal. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains a single integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 9). -----Output----- Print 2^{k} lines consisting of 2^{k} characters each. The j-th character of the i-th line must be equal to ' * ' if the j-th coordinate of the i-th vector is equal to  - 1, and must be equal to ' + ' if it's equal to  + 1. It's guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are many correct answers, print any. -----Examples----- Input 2 Output ++** +*+* ++++ +**+ -----Note----- Consider all scalar products in example:  Vectors 1 and 2: ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( + 1)·( - 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) + ( - 1)·( - 1) = 0  Vectors 1 and 3: ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) = 0  Vectors 1 and 4: ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( + 1)·( - 1) + ( - 1)·( - 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) = 0  Vectors 2 and 3: ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) + ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) = 0  Vectors 2 and 4: ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( - 1)·( - 1) + ( + 1)·( - 1) + ( - 1)·( + 1) = 0  Vectors 3 and 4: ( + 1)·( + 1) + ( + 1)·( - 1) + ( + 1)·( - 1) + ( + 1)·( + 1) = 0
