 You are given grid of size $a \times b$ and a coordinate $(x, y)$ within that grid.  You need to output the largest area of a rectangle that does not include the coordinate $(x, y)$. The boundaries of the rectangle should be parallel to the sides of the grid. 
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, where $N$ is the number of days for which the price data is available and $K$ is the maximum number of times that Ramu is willing to visit the cattle market.  - The next $N$ lines (line $2, 3,...,N+1$) contain a single positive integer each. The integer on line $i+1$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, indicates the price of a buffalo on day $i$. -----Output:----- A single nonnegative integer indicating that maximum amount of profit that Ramu can make if he were to make at most $K$ trips to the market. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 400$. - $1 \leq K \leq 400$. - $0 \leq$ price of a buffalo on any day $\leq 1000$ -----Sample Input 1:----- 10 5 10 12 8 11 11 10 12 15 13 10 -----Sample Output 1:----- 9 -----Sample Input 2:----- 10 6 10 12 8 11 11 10 12 15 13 10 -----Sample Output 2:----- 10
