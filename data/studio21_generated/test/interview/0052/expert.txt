 Given n teams, print all possible number of teams such that tournament needs exactly n games. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), the number of games that should be played. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Output----- Print all possible numbers of invited teams in ascending order, one per line. If exactly n games cannot be played, output one number: -1. -----Examples----- Input 3 Output 3 4 Input 25 Output 20 Input 2 Output -1
