 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3\leq n \leq 10\,000$, $1 \leq q \leq 200000$) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the number of queries. The next $n$ lines describe the wooden polygon, the $i$-th line contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($|x_i|, |y_i|\leq 10^8$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th vertex of the polygon. It is guaranteed that polygon is strictly convex and the vertices are given in the counter-clockwise order and all vertices are distinct. The next $q$ lines describe the queries, one per line. Each query starts with its type $1$ or $2$. Each query of the first type continues with two integers $f$ and $t$ ($1 \le f, t \le n$) — the vertex the pin is taken from, and the vertex the pin is put to and the polygon finishes rotating. It is guaranteed that the vertex $f$ contains a pin. Each query of the second type continues with a single integer $v$ ($1 \le v \le n$) — the vertex the coordinates of which Hag should tell his father. It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type. -----Output----- The output should contain the answer to each query of second type — two numbers in a separate line. Your answer is considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-4}$. Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is considered correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-4}$ -----Examples----- Input 3 4 0 0 2 0 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 3 Output 3.4142135624 -1.4142135624 2.0000000000 0.0000000000 0.5857864376 -1.4142135624 Input 3 2 -1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 Output 1.0000000000 -1.0000000000 -----Note----- In the first test note the initial and the final state of the wooden polygon.  [Image]  Red Triangle is the initial state and the green one is the triangle after rotation around $(2,0)$. In the second sample note that the polygon rotates $180$ degrees counter-clockwise or clockwise direction (it does not matter), because Hag's father makes sure that the polygon is stable and his son does not trick him.
