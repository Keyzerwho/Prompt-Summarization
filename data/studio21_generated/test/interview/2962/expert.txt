 You are given N numbers.  You want to find L numbers such that: each number appears atleast once each number appears atleast once each number appears atleast once each number appears atleast once each number appears atleast once each number appears atleast once each number appears atleast once Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $N$ $(1\leq N\leq 10000)$ and $T$ $(1\le T \le 47)$, the number of people in the queue and the time in minutes until Oliver closes the bank. Then follow $N$ lines, each with 2 integers $c_ i$ and $t_ i$, denoting the amount of cash in Swedish crowns person $i$ has and the time in minutes from now after which person $i$ leaves if not served. Note that it takes one minute to serve a person and you must begin serving a person at time $t_ i$ at the latest. You can assume that $1\le c_ i \le 100000$ and $0 \le t_ i < T$. -----Output----- Output one line with the maximum amount of money you can get from the people in the queue before the bank closes. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 4 1000 1 2000 2 500 2 1200 0 Sample Output: 4200
