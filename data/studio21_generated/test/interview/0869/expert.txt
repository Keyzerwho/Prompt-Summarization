 You are given an array of integers. You need to find the minimum number of days in which Vasya can wear different socks. 
-----Input----- The single line of the input contains two positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100) — the number of red and blue socks that Vasya's got. -----Output----- Print two space-separated integers — the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different socks and the number of days when he can wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got. Keep in mind that at the end of the day Vasya throws away the socks that he's been wearing on that day. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 Output 1 1 Input 2 3 Output 2 0 Input 7 3 Output 3 2 -----Note----- In the first sample Vasya can first put on one pair of different socks, after that he has two red socks left to wear on the second day.
