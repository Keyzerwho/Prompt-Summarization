 You are given a number n, and a number x, y. zscoder wants to find the minimum amount of time needed for him to generate the input file of exactly n letters 'a'. Help him to determine the amount of time needed to generate the input. 
-----Input----- The only line contains three integers n, x and y (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^7, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) — the number of letters 'a' in the input file and the parameters from the problem statement. -----Output----- Print the only integer t — the minimum amount of time needed to generate the input file. -----Examples----- Input 8 1 1 Output 4 Input 8 1 10 Output 8
