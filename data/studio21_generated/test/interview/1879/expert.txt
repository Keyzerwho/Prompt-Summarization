 =====Problem Statement===== Given (x, y) and t seconds, return the earliest time they will reach (e_{x}, e_{y}) 
-----Input----- The first line contains five integers t, s_{x}, s_{y}, e_{x}, e_{y} (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5,  - 10^9 ≤ s_{x}, s_{y}, e_{x}, e_{y} ≤ 10^9). The starting location and the ending location will be different. The second line contains t characters, the i-th character is the wind blowing direction at the i-th second. It will be one of the four possibilities: "E" (east), "S" (south), "W" (west) and "N" (north). -----Output----- If they can reach (e_{x}, e_{y}) within t seconds, print the earliest time they can achieve it. Otherwise, print "-1" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 5 0 0 1 1 SESNW Output 4 Input 10 5 3 3 6 NENSWESNEE Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample, they can stay at seconds 1, 3, and move at seconds 2, 4. In the second sample, they cannot sail to the destination.
