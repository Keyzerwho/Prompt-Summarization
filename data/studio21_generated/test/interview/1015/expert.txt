 You are given n integers, each is the number of lemmings to the left of the lemming with a shield. Return the maximal value of army protection for each $k$ from $0$ to $\frac{n(n-1)}2$, if he gives no more that $k$ orders. 
-----Input----- First line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 80$), the number of lemmings in Peter's army. Second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$). If $a_i = 1$, then the $i$-th lemming has a shield, otherwise $a_i = 0$. -----Output----- Print $\frac{n(n-1)}2 + 1$ numbers, the greatest possible protection after no more than $0, 1, \dots, \frac{n(n-1)}2$ orders. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 0 0 0 1 Output 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  Input 12 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 Output 9 12 13 14 14 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15  -----Note----- Consider the first example. The protection is initially equal to zero, because for each pair of lemmings without shields there is no lemmings with shield. In one second Peter can order the first lemming give his shield to the right neighbor. In this case, the protection is two, as there are two protected pairs of lemmings, $(1, 3)$ and $(1, 4)$. In two seconds Peter can act in the following way. First, he orders the fifth lemming to give a shield to the left neighbor. Then, he orders the first lemming to give a shield to the right neighbor. In this case Peter has three protected pairs of lemmings — $(1, 3)$, $(1, 5)$ and $(3, 5)$. You can make sure that it's impossible to give orders in such a way that the protection becomes greater than three.
