 You are given n cities. You need to find minimum time to reach last city. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The value m specifies the number of roads between cities which is equal to n - 1. The next line contains m space-separated integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_{m} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 1000) and the following line contains m space-separated integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 1000). -----Output----- In the only line of the output print a single integer — the minimum time required for The Old Peykan to reach city c_{n} from city c_1. -----Examples----- Input 4 6 1 2 5 2 2 3 3 4 Output 10 Input 2 3 5 6 5 5 Output 14 -----Note----- In the second sample above, the Old Peykan stays in c_1 for 3 hours.
