 You are given a list of integers. You want to split the list into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$), representing the number of different kinds of food and the number of customers, respectively. The second line contains $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7$), where $a_i$ denotes the initial remain of the $i$-th kind of dishes. The third line contains $n$ positive integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq 10^6$), where $c_i$ denotes the cost of one dish of the $i$-th kind. The following $m$ lines describe the orders of the $m$ customers respectively. The $j$-th line contains two positive integers $t_j$ and $d_j$ ($1 \leq t_j \leq n$, $1 \leq d_j \leq 10^7$), representing the kind of food and the number of dishes the $j$-th customer orders, respectively. -----Output----- Print $m$ lines. In the $j$-th line print the cost for the $j$-th customer. -----Examples----- Input 8 5 8 6 2 1 4 5 7 5 6 3 3 2 6 2 3 2 2 8 1 4 4 7 3 4 6 10 Output 22 24 14 10 39 Input 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 66 666 6666 66666 666666 1 6 2 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6 66 Output 36 396 3996 39996 399996 0 Input 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 66 666 6666 66666 666666 1 6 2 13 3 6 4 11 5 6 6 6 Output 36 11058 99996 4333326 0 0 -----Note----- In the first sample, $5$ customers will be served as follows. Customer $1$ will be served $6$ dishes of the $2$-nd kind, $1$ dish of the $4$-th kind, and $1$ dish of the $6$-th kind. The cost is $6 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2 = 22$. The remain of the $8$ kinds of food will be $\{8, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 7, 5\}$. Customer $2$ will be served $4$ dishes of the $1$-st kind. The cost is $4 \cdot 6 = 24$. The remain will be $\{4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 4, 7, 5\}$. Customer $3$ will be served $4$ dishes of the $6$-th kind, $3$ dishes of the $8$-th kind. The cost is $4 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 = 14$. The remain will be $\{4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 7, 2\}$. Customer $4$ will be served $2$ dishes of the $3$-rd kind, $2$ dishes of the $8$-th kind. The cost is $2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 2 = 10$. The remain will be $\{4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0\}$. Customer $5$ will be served $7$ dishes of the $7$-th kind, $3$ dishes of the $1$-st kind. The cost is $7 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 6 = 39$. The remain will be $\{1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0\}$. In the second sample, each customer is served what they order except the last one, who leaves angrily without paying. For example, the second customer is served $6$ dishes of the second kind, so the cost is $66 \cdot 6 = 396$. In the third sample, some customers may not be served what they order. For example, the second customer is served $6$ dishes of the second kind, $6$ of the third and $1$ of the fourth, so the cost is $66 \cdot 6 + 666 \cdot 6 + 6666 \cdot 1 = 11058$.
