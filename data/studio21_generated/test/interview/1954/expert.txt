 Given n, f pairs, you need to output the number of ways to distribute sweets to his friends in the required way. Note that the order of distribution is important, for example [1, 2] and [2, 1] are distinct distributions. As the answer could be very large, output answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). To make the problem more interesting, you are given q queries. Each query contains an n, f pair. For each query please output the required number of ways modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). summary :  
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer q representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). Each of the next q lines contains two space space-separated integers n, f (1 ≤ f ≤ n ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- For each query, output a single integer in a line corresponding to the answer of each query. -----Examples----- Input 5 6 2 7 2 6 3 6 4 7 4 Output 2 6 9 10 20 -----Note----- For first query: n = 6, f = 2. Possible partitions are [1, 5] and [5, 1]. For second query: n = 7, f = 2. Possible partitions are [1, 6] and [2, 5] and [3, 4] and [4, 3] and [5, 3] and [6, 1]. So in total there are 6 possible ways of partitioning.
