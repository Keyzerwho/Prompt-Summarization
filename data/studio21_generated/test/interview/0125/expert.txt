 You are given an array $A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,
-----Input----- The input consists of four lines with each line describing a road part given in a counter-clockwise order. Each line contains four integers l, s, r, p â€” for the left, straight, right and pedestrian lights, respectively. The possible values are 0 for red light and 1 for green light. -----Output----- On a single line, print "YES" if an accident is possible, and "NO" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 Output YES Input 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 Output NO Input 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example, some accidents are possible because cars of part 1 can hit pedestrians of parts 1 and 4. Also, cars of parts 2 and 3 can hit pedestrians of part 4. In the second example, no car can pass the pedestrian crossing of part 4 which is the only green pedestrian light. So, no accident can occur.
