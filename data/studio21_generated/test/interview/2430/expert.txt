 You are at root of the tree with the number 1. In one second, you can perform one of the following actions:  Walk up or down one unit on a tree.  Eat a nut on the top of the current tree.  Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss doesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height h of the tree i (1   i   n - 1), she jumps to height h of the tree i + 1. This action can't be performed if h > h_{i} + 1.  Compute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1  ≤  n ≤ 10^5) — the number of trees. Next n lines contains the height of trees: i-th line contains an integer h_{i} (1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 10^4) — the height of the tree with the number i. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimal time required to eat all nuts in seconds. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 Output 5 Input 5 2 1 2 1 1 Output 14
