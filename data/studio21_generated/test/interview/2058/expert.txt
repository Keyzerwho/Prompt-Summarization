 Given two binary strings, find the sum of the Hamming distances between a and all contiguous substrings of b of length |a|. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains binary string a (1 ≤ |a| ≤ 200 000). The second line of the input contains binary string b (|a| ≤ |b| ≤ 200 000). Both strings are guaranteed to consist of characters '0' and '1' only. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the sum of Hamming distances between a and all contiguous substrings of b of length |a|. -----Examples----- Input 01 00111 Output 3 Input 0011 0110 Output 2 -----Note----- For the first sample case, there are four contiguous substrings of b of length |a|: "00", "01", "11", and "11". The distance between "01" and "00" is |0 - 0| + |1 - 0| = 1. The distance between "01" and "01" is |0 - 0| + |1 - 1| = 0. The distance between "01" and "11" is |0 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 1. Last distance counts twice, as there are two occurrences of string "11". The sum of these edit distances is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3. The second sample case is described in the statement.
