 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the minimum number of seconds after which Vasya can get to one of the cashiers. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of cashes in the shop. The second line contains n space-separated integers: k_1, k_2, ..., k_{n} (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 100), where k_{i} is the number of people in the queue to the i-th cashier. The i-th of the next n lines contains k_{i} space-separated integers: m_{i}, 1, m_{i}, 2, ..., m_{i}, k_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i}, j ≤ 100) — the number of products the j-th person in the queue for the i-th cash has. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds Vasya needs to get to the cashier. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 Output 20 Input 4 1 4 3 2 100 1 2 2 3 1 9 1 7 8 Output 100 -----Note----- In the second test sample, if Vasya goes to the first queue, he gets to the cashier in 100·5 + 15 = 515 seconds. But if he chooses the second queue, he will need 1·5 + 2·5 + 2·5 + 3·5 + 4·15 = 100 seconds. He will need 1·5 + 9·5 + 1·5 + 3·15 = 100 seconds for the third one and 7·5 + 8·5 + 2·15 = 105 seconds for the fourth one. Thus, Vasya gets to the cashier quicker if he chooses the second or the third queue.
