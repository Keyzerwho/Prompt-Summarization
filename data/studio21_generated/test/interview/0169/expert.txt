 You are given two integers $n$ and $c$. Your task is to find an optimal strategy Kolya can use to spend $n$ rubles and get the most kefir. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) — the number of rubles Kolya has at the beginning. Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ c < b ≤ 10^18) — the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of one glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty glass bottle, respectively. -----Output----- Print the only integer — maximum number of liters of kefir, that Kolya can drink. -----Examples----- Input 10 11 9 8 Output 2 Input 10 5 6 1 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle, then return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of kefir. In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two liters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy one plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.
