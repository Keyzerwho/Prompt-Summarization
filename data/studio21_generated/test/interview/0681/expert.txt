 You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The input contains a single line consisting of $2$ integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \le N \le 10^{18}$, $2 \le M \le 100$). -----Output----- Print one integer, the total number of configurations of the resulting set of gems, given that the total amount of space taken is $N$ units. Print the answer modulo $1000000007$ ($10^9+7$). -----Examples----- Input 4 2 Output 5 Input 3 2 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example each magic gem can split into $2$ normal gems, and we know that the total amount of gems are $4$. Let $1$ denote a magic gem, and $0$ denote a normal gem. The total configurations you can have is:   $1 1 1 1$ (None of the gems split);  $0 0 1 1$ (First magic gem splits into $2$ normal gems);  $1 0 0 1$ (Second magic gem splits into $2$ normal gems);  $1 1 0 0$ (Third magic gem splits into $2$ normal gems);  $0 0 0 0$ (First and second magic gems split into total $4$ normal gems).  Hence, answer is $5$.
