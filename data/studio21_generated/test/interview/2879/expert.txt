 You are given an integer N, and a list of N integers. Your task is to find all the polyomino powers (i.e., polyominos that are obtained by gluing several copies of the same smaller polyomino translated (but not rotated or mirrored) to different locations in the plane). 
-----Input----- One line with two positive integers $h, w \leq 10$. Next follows an $h \times w$ matrix of characters ‘.’ or ‘X’, the ‘X’s describing a polyomino and ‘.’ space. -----Output----- A $k$-power with $2 \leq k \leq 5$ copies of a smaller polyomino: Output a $h\times w$ matrix on the same format as the input with the ‘X’s replaced by the numbers $1$ through $k$ in any order identifying the factor pieces. Furthermore, if multiple solutions exist, any will do. Otherwise, output “No solution” if no solution exists. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 7 .XXXXX. .XX..X. XXXX... Sample Output 1: No solution Sample Input 2: 1 3 XXX Sample Output 2: 123
