 You are given $n$, $m$ and $k$, calculate the maximum number of points a player can get for winning the game. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 50$, $0 \le m \le n$, $2 \le k \le n$, $k$ is a divisors of $n$). -----Output----- For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of points a player can get for winning the game. -----Example----- Input 4 8 3 2 4 2 4 9 6 3 42 0 7 Output 3 0 1 0 -----Note----- Test cases of the example are described in the statement.
