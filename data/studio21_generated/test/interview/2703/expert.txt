 Given two integers N and Q denoting the number of festival days and number of queries respectively. The second line is the array whose ith element is the maximum number of candies Binod can collect on that day. Each of the next Q lines contains the number X i.e the minimum number of candies Binod wants to have at the end of every day on which he collects any candy. Output format:  For every query output, a single integer denoting the max number of candies Binod may collect (for the given X ) to be happy after the festival ends. 
Constraints:   1<=N,Q<=105   1<=Q<=105   0<=ai<=109   0<=X<=109   Sample Input :  5 2 4 6 5 8 7 1 2 Sample Output :  30 30 Sample Input:   6 3  20 10 12 3 30 5  2  6  13  Sample Output   77  62  30  Explanation:  In the first query of sample input 1, Binod can collect the maximum number of given chocolates for a given day each day as after the end of every day Binod will have a number of collected chocolates on that day greater than equal to 1 even after giving 1 chocolate to Pelu. So the the answer is 4+6+5+8+7=30.
