 You are given 2n people, you need to output a distribution of cups. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers, n and w (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9) — the number of Pasha's friends that are boys (equal to the number of Pasha's friends that are girls) and the capacity of Pasha's teapot in milliliters. The second line of the input contains the sequence of integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) — the capacities of Pasha's tea cups in milliliters. -----Output----- Print a single real number — the maximum total amount of water in milliliters that Pasha can pour to his friends without violating the given conditions. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 2 4 1 1 1 1 Output 3 Input 3 18 4 4 4 2 2 2 Output 18 Input 1 5 2 3 Output 4.5 -----Note----- Pasha also has candies that he is going to give to girls but that is another task...
