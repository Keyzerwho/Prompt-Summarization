 You are given a square of size n cells. Igor placed several pieces on the board and for each unoccupied square he told you whether it is attacked by any present piece (i.e. whether some of the pieces on the field can move to that cell). Restore a possible set of shift vectors of the piece, or else determine that Igor has made a mistake and such situation is impossible for any set of shift vectors.
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The next n lines contain n characters each describing the position offered by Igor. The j-th character of the i-th string can have the following values: o — in this case the field (i, j) is occupied by a piece and the field may or may not be attacked by some other piece; x — in this case field (i, j) is attacked by some piece; . — in this case field (i, j) isn't attacked by any piece. It is guaranteed that there is at least one piece on the board. -----Output----- If there is a valid set of moves, in the first line print a single word 'YES' (without the quotes). Next, print the description of the set of moves of a piece in the form of a (2n - 1) × (2n - 1) board, the center of the board has a piece and symbols 'x' mark cells that are attacked by it, in a format similar to the input. See examples of the output for a full understanding of the format. If there are several possible answers, print any of them. If a valid set of moves does not exist, print a single word 'NO'. -----Examples----- Input 5 oxxxx x...x x...x x...x xxxxo Output YES ....x.... ....x.... ....x.... ....x.... xxxxoxxxx ....x.... ....x.... ....x.... ....x.... Input 6 .x.x.. x.x.x. .xo..x x..ox. .x.x.x ..x.x. Output YES ........... ........... ........... ....x.x.... ...x...x... .....o..... ...x...x... ....x.x.... ........... ........... ........... Input 3 o.x oxx o.x Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample test the piece is a usual chess rook, and in the second sample test the piece is a usual chess knight.
