 You are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order
-----Input----- The input will have a single line containing four integers in this order: x, y, a, b. (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2·10^9, a ≤ b). -----Output----- Output a single integer — the number of bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b that are painted both red and pink. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 6 18 Output 3 -----Note----- Let's look at the bricks from a to b (a = 6, b = 18). The bricks colored in red are numbered 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. The bricks colored in pink are numbered 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The bricks colored in both red and pink are numbered with 6, 12 and 18.
