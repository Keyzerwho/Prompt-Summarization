 You have $n$ Rebel spaceships and $B$ bases. You need to find the smallest number of Rebel spaceships that can be assigned such that every base has exactly one assigned spaceship and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line. -----Output----- If it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote). -----Examples----- Input 3 3 0 0 2 0 3 1 -2 1 0 3 2 2 Output Yes Input 2 1 1 0 2 2 3 1 Output No -----Note----- For the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order. For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.
