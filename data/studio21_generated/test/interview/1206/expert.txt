 You are given n companies competing for placing an ad. The i-th of these companies will bid an integer number of microdollars equiprobably randomly chosen from the range between L_{i} and R_{i}, inclusive. In the other words, the value of the i-th company bid can be any integer from the range [L_{i}, R_{i}] with the same probability.  Determine the expected value that the winner will have to pay in a second-price auction. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 5). n lines follow, the i-th of them containing two numbers L_{i} and R_{i} (1 ≤ L_{i} ≤ R_{i} ≤ 10000) describing the i-th company's bid preferences. This problem doesn't have subproblems. You will get 8 points for the correct submission. -----Output----- Output the answer with absolute or relative error no more than 1e - 9. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 7 8 10 5 5 Output 5.7500000000 Input 3 2 5 3 4 1 6 Output 3.5000000000 -----Note----- Consider the first example. The first company bids a random integer number of microdollars in range [4, 7]; the second company bids between 8 and 10, and the third company bids 5 microdollars. The second company will win regardless of the exact value it bids, however the price it will pay depends on the value of first company's bid. With probability 0.5 the first company will bid at most 5 microdollars, and the second-highest price of the whole auction will be 5. With probability 0.25 it will bid 6 microdollars, and with probability 0.25 it will bid 7 microdollars. Thus, the expected value the second company will have to pay is 0.5·5 + 0.25·6 + 0.25·7 = 5.75.
