 You are given the strengths of all possible combinations of two people. You need to output the two people s teammates. 
-----Input----- There are 2n lines in the input.  The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 400) — the number of teams to be formed. The i-th line (i > 1) contains i - 1 numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ... , a_{i}(i - 1). Here a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ 10^6, all a_{ij} are distinct) denotes the strength of a team consisting of person i and person j (people are numbered starting from 1.) -----Output----- Output a line containing 2n numbers. The i-th number should represent the number of teammate of i-th person. -----Examples----- Input 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 Output 2 1 4 3 Input 3 487060 3831 161856 845957 794650 976977 83847 50566 691206 498447 698377 156232 59015 382455 626960 Output 6 5 4 3 2 1 -----Note----- In the first sample, contestant 1 and 2 will be teammates and so do contestant 3 and 4, so the teammate of contestant 1, 2, 3, 4 will be 2, 1, 4, 3 respectively.
