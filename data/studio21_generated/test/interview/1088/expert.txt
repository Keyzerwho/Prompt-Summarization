 You are given N^2 integers. Find the number of matrices that can be obtained by the following operations: 1. Pick two integers x, y (1 \leq x < y \leq N) that satisfy a_{i, x} + a_{i, y} \leq K for all i (1 \leq i \leq N) and swap the x-th and the y-th columns. 2. Pick two integers x, y (1 \leq x < y \leq N) that satisfy a_{x, i} + a_{y, i} \leq K for all i (1 \leq i \leq N) and swap the x-th and the y-th rows. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N K a_{1, 1} a_{1, 2} ... a_{1, N} a_{2, 1} a_{2, 2} ... a_{2, N} : a_{N, 1} a_{N, 2} ... a_{N, N} -----Output----- Print the number of matrices Sigma can obtain modulo 998244353. -----Sample Input----- 3 13 3 2 7 4 8 9 1 6 5 -----Sample Output----- 12 For example, Sigma can swap two columns, by setting x = 1, y = 2. After that, the resulting matrix will be: 2 3 7 8 4 9 6 1 5 After that, he can swap two row vectors by setting x = 1, y = 3, resulting in the following matrix: 6 1 5 8 4 9 2 3 7
