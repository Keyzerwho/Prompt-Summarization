 You are given a list of contest results. For each contest result, you need to output "good" or "bad". 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of participants Anton has outscored in this contest . The next n lines describe participants results: the i-th of them consists of a participant handle name_{i} and two integers before_{i} and after_{i} ( - 4000 ≤ before_{i}, after_{i} ≤ 4000) — participant's rating before and after the contest, respectively. Each handle is a non-empty string, consisting of no more than 10 characters, which might be lowercase and uppercase English letters, digits, characters «_» and «-» characters. It is guaranteed that all handles are distinct. -----Output----- Print «YES» (quotes for clarity), if Anton has performed good in the contest and «NO» (quotes for clarity) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 Burunduk1 2526 2537 BudAlNik 2084 2214 subscriber 2833 2749 Output YES Input 3 Applejack 2400 2400 Fluttershy 2390 2431 Pinkie_Pie -2500 -2450 Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample, Anton has outscored user with handle Burunduk1, whose handle was colored red before the contest and his rating has increased after the contest. In the second sample, Applejack's rating has not increased after the contest, while both Fluttershy's and Pinkie_Pie's handles were not colored red before the contest.
