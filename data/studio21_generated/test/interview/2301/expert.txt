 Given $n$ ice spheres and their prices, reorder them such that the maximum number that Sage can buy is $M$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$ — the number of ice spheres in the shop. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ — the prices of ice spheres. -----Output----- In the first line print the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy. In the second line print the prices of ice spheres in the optimal order. If there are several correct answers, you can print any of them. -----Example----- Input 7 1 3 2 2 4 5 4 Output 3 3 1 4 2 4 2 5  -----Note----- In the sample it's not possible to place the ice spheres in any order so that Sage would buy $4$ of them. If the spheres are placed in the order $(3, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 5)$, then Sage will buy one sphere for $1$ and two spheres for $2$ each.
