 
-----Input----- Input contains several test cases. The first line contains two integers t and k (1 ≤ t, k ≤ 10^5), where t represents the number of test cases. The next t lines contain two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^5), describing the i-th test. -----Output----- Print t lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain the number of ways in which Marmot can eat between a_{i} and b_{i} flowers at dinner modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 3 2 3 4 4 Output 6 5 5 -----Note-----  For K = 2 and length 1 Marmot can eat (R).  For K = 2 and length 2 Marmot can eat (RR) and (WW).  For K = 2 and length 3 Marmot can eat (RRR), (RWW) and (WWR).  For K = 2 and length 4 Marmot can eat, for example, (WWWW) or (RWWR), but for example he can't eat (WWWR).
