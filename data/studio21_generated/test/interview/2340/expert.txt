 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 100$) — the number of queries. Each query contains two lines and is independent of all other queries. The first line of each query contains two integers $h$ and $n$ ($1 \le h \le 10^9$, $1 \le n \le \min(h, 2 \cdot 10^5)$) — the height of the cliff and the number of moved out platforms. The second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($h = p_1 > p_2 > \dots > p_n \ge 1$) — the corresponding moved out platforms in the descending order of their heights. The sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each query print one integer — the minimum number of magic crystals you have to spend to safely come down on the ground level (with height $0$). -----Example----- Input 4 3 2 3 1 8 6 8 7 6 5 3 2 9 6 9 8 5 4 3 1 1 1 1 Output 0 1 2 0
