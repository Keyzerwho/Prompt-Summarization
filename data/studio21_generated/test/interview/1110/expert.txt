 You are given a sequence of buttons. The sequence can be {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, etc. Manao doesn't know the sequence, but he knows the number of buttons in the sequence. Calculate the number of times Manao has to press a button in order to open the lock in the worst-case scenario. 
-----Input----- A single line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of buttons the lock has. -----Output----- In a single line print the number of times Manao has to push a button in the worst-case scenario. -----Examples----- Input 2 Output 3 Input 3 Output 7 -----Note----- Consider the first test sample. Manao can fail his first push and push the wrong button. In this case he will already be able to guess the right one with his second push. And his third push will push the second right button. Thus, in the worst-case scenario he will only need 3 pushes.
