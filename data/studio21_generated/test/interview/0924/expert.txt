 You are given two integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $l_a$, $r_a$, $t_a$ ($0 \le l_a \le r_a \le t_a - 1, 2 \le t_a \le 10^9$) and describes Alice's lucky days. The second line contains three integers $l_b$, $r_b$, $t_b$ ($0 \le l_b \le r_b \le t_b - 1, 2 \le t_b \le 10^9$) and describes Bob's lucky days. It is guaranteed that both Alice and Bob have some unlucky days. -----Output----- Print one integer: the maximum number of days in the row that are lucky for both Alice and Bob. -----Examples----- Input 0 2 5 1 3 5 Output 2 Input 0 1 3 2 3 6 Output 1 -----Note----- The graphs below correspond to the two sample tests and show the lucky and unlucky days of Alice and Bob as well as the possible solutions for these tests.
