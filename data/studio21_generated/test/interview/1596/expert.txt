 You are given a string of characters. You need to return the number of possible words that can be made from these characters. 
-----Input----- Input consists of a single line containing a string $s$ ($1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5$) — the received message. $s$ contains only lowercase Latin letters. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of strings that Constanze's machine would've turned into the message $s$, modulo $10^9+7$. -----Examples----- Input ouuokarinn Output 4 Input banana Output 1 Input nnn Output 3 Input amanda Output 0 -----Note----- For the first example, the candidate strings are the following: "ouuokarinn", "ouuokarim", "owokarim", and "owokarinn". For the second example, there is only one: "banana". For the third example, the candidate strings are the following: "nm", "mn" and "nnn". For the last example, there are no candidate strings that the machine can turn into "amanda", since the machine won't inscribe 'm'.
