 Given the number of plus and minus operators in the original expression, find out the maximum possible value for the expression on the papyrus paper after putting the plus and minus operators in the place of the original erased operators. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a string E (1 ≤ |E| ≤ 10^4) — a valid Ahmes arithmetic expression. All operators are erased and replaced with '?'. The second line contains two space-separated integers P and M (0 ≤ min(P, M) ≤ 100) — the number of plus and minus operators, respectively.  It is guaranteed that P + M =  the number of erased operators. -----Output----- Print one line containing the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input (1?1) 1 0 Output 2 Input (2?(1?2)) 1 1 Output 1 Input ((1?(5?7))?((6?2)?7)) 3 2 Output 18 Input ((1?(5?7))?((6?2)?7)) 2 3 Output 16 -----Note-----  The first sample will be (1 + 1)  =  2.  The second sample will be (2 + (1 - 2))  =  1.  The third sample will be ((1 - (5 - 7)) + ((6 + 2) + 7))  =  18.  The fourth sample will be ((1 + (5 + 7)) - ((6 - 2) - 7))  =  16.
