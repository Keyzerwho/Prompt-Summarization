 You are given $n$ integers.  Find the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $(r_1, c_1)$ to $(r_2, c_2)$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50$) — the width of the square grid. The second line contains two space-separated integers $r_1$ and $c_1$ ($1 \leq r_1, c_1 \leq n$) — denoting the cell where Alice resides. The third line contains two space-separated integers $r_2$ and $c_2$ ($1 \leq r_2, c_2 \leq n$) — denoting the cell to which Alice wishes to travel. Each of the following $n$ lines contains a string of $n$ characters. The $j$-th character of the $i$-th such line ($1 \leq i, j \leq n$) is 0 if $(i, j)$ is land or 1 if $(i, j)$ is water. It is guaranteed that $(r_1, c_1)$ and $(r_2, c_2)$ are land. -----Output----- Print an integer that is the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $(r_1, c_1)$ to $(r_2, c_2)$. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 1 5 5 00001 11111 00111 00110 00110 Output 10 Input 3 1 3 3 1 010 101 010 Output 8 -----Note----- In the first sample, a tunnel between cells $(1, 4)$ and $(4, 5)$ should be created. The cost of doing so is $(1-4)^2 + (4-5)^2 = 10$, which is optimal. This way, Alice could walk from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 4)$, use the tunnel from $(1, 4)$ to $(4, 5)$, and lastly walk from $(4, 5)$ to $(5, 5)$. In the second sample, clearly a tunnel between cells $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$ needs to be created. The cost of doing so is $(1-3)^2 + (3-1)^2 = 8$.
