 You are given an array of numbers. Find the largest achievable value of this sum. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of dancers. The following n lines each describes a dancer: the i-th line among them contains three space-separated integers x_{i}, y_{i} and r_{i} ( - 10^6 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ r_{i} ≤ 10^6), describing a circular movement range centered at (x_{i}, y_{i}) with radius r_{i}. -----Output----- Output one decimal number — the largest achievable sum of spaciousness over two halves of the night. The output is considered correct if it has a relative or absolute error of at most 10^{ - 9}. Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 1 6 0 4 1 2 -1 3 1 -2 1 4 -1 1 Output 138.23007676 Input 8 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0 8 Output 289.02652413 -----Note----- The first sample corresponds to the illustrations in the legend.
