 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the size of the sought permutation. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print a single number — the minimum number of moves. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 0 Output 2 Input 3 -1 -1 2 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first sample you should decrease the first number by one and then increase the second number by one. The resulting permutation is (2, 1). In the second sample you need 6 moves to build permutation (1, 3, 2).
