 There are $n$ freight trains and $2h$ passenger trams. The freight trains depart at the same time - $i$-th train departs at $h_i$ hours and $m_i$ minutes.  The passenger trams depart at $0$ hours and $t$ minutes. The boarding of passenger trams must start $k$ minutes before the departure. The freight trains must depart at the very moment when the boarding starts and at the moment when the passenger tram departs. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains four integers $n$, $h$, $m$, $k$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $1 \le h \le 10^9$, $2 \le m \le 10^9$, $m$ is even, $1 \le k \le {m \over 2}$) — the number of freight trains per day, the number of hours and minutes on the planet, and the boarding time for each passenger tram. $n$ lines follow, each contains two integers $h_i$ and $m_i$ ($0 \le h_i < h$, $0 \le m_i < m$) — the time when $i$-th freight train departs. It is guaranteed that no freight trains depart at the same time. -----Output----- The first line of output should contain two integers: the minimum number of trains that need to be canceled, and the optimal starting time $t$. Second line of output should contain freight trains that need to be canceled. -----Examples----- Input 2 24 60 15 16 0 17 15 Output 0 0 Input 2 24 60 16 16 0 17 15 Output 1 0 2  -----Note----- In the first test case of the example the first tram can depart at 0 hours and 0 minutes. Then the freight train at 16 hours and 0 minutes can depart at the same time as the passenger tram, and the freight train at 17 hours and 15 minutes can depart at the same time as the boarding starts for the upcoming passenger tram. In the second test case of the example it is not possible to design the passenger tram schedule without cancelling any of the freight trains: if $t \in [1, 15]$, then the freight train at 16 hours and 0 minutes is not able to depart (since boarding time is 16 minutes). If $t = 0$ or $t \in [16, 29]$, then the freight train departing at 17 hours 15 minutes is not able to depart. However, if the second freight train is canceled, one can choose $t = 0$. Another possible option is to cancel the first train and choose $t = 13$.
