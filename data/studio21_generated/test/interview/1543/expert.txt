 You have two countries Byteland and Berland, and two countries want to build a network between them. You have a list of cities, where each city is a point on the line $Ox$. It is technically possible to connect the cities $a$ and $b$ with a cable so that the city $c$ ($a < c < b$) is not connected to this cable, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are simultaneously coordinates of the cities $a$, $b$ and $c$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$) — the number of cities. The following $n$ lines contains an integer $x_i$ and the letter $c_i$ ($-10^{9} \le x_i \le 10^{9}$) — the coordinate of the city and its type. If the city belongs to Byteland, $c_i$ equals to 'B'. If the city belongs to Berland, $c_i$ equals to «R». If the city is disputed, $c_i$ equals to 'P'.  All cities have distinct coordinates. Guaranteed, that the cities are given in the increasing order of their coordinates. -----Output----- Print the minimal total length of such set of cables, that if we delete all Berland cities ($c_i$='R'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables. Similarly, if we delete all Byteland cities ($c_i$='B'), it will be possible to find a way from any remaining city to any other remaining city, moving only by cables. -----Examples----- Input 4 -5 R 0 P 3 P 7 B Output 12 Input 5 10 R 14 B 16 B 21 R 32 R Output 24 -----Note----- In the first example, you should connect the first city with the second, the second with the third, and the third with the fourth. The total length of the cables will be $5 + 3 + 4 = 12$. In the second example there are no disputed cities, so you need to connect all the neighboring cities of Byteland and all the neighboring cities of Berland. The cities of Berland have coordinates $10, 21, 32$, so to connect them you need two cables of length $11$ and $11$. The cities of Byteland have coordinates $14$ and $16$, so to connect them you need one cable of length $2$. Thus, the total length of all cables is $11 + 11 + 2 = 24$.
