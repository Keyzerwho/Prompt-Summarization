 You have $n$ nodes in a graph. The $i$-th node starts with a value of $i$. The node values will be revised $q$ times. For the $j$-th revision, node $v_i$ will have a value of $n+i$. The node $v_i$ will have this value for the only the $j$-th revision, it will have value $i$ otherwise. Some nodes dislike with each other, if two nodes $a$ and $b$ dislike with each other and $a$ has a higher value than $b$ then $a$ conflicts with $b$. A dangerous triple is three nodes $a$, $b$, $c$ such that $a$ conflicts with $b$ and $b$ conflicts with $c$. You need to find the number of dangerous triples before the revisions and after each revision. 
-----Input----- The only line of input consists of a non-negative integer, written in base $8$. The given integer will have no leading zeroes and will be strictly smaller than $8^{200000}$. -----Output----- Output the same integer, written in base $16$. The output must not include any extra leading zeroes. -----Explanation for sample data----- For Sample Input 1, $4444_8 = 2340_{10} = 924_{16}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4444 Sample Output 1: 924 Sample Input 2: 20 Sample Output 2: 10 Sample Input 3: 3211 Sample Output 3: 689
