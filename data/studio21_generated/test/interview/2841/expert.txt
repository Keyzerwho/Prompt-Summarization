 You are given N+1 squares in a line and your goal is to move from Start to Nth square. Then, you draw cards. Each card has a single color. If you draw a card that has the color on the square you are on, you move to the nearest square with the same color. If there are no squares of the drawn color after your current square, your piece does not move. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 200000$) denoting the number of squares. The next $N$ lines each contain a single string $S_ i \in \{ \text {Blue}, \text {Orange}, \text {Pink}, \text {Green}, \text {Red}, \text {Yellow}\} $ representing the color of the $i^\text {th}$ square, starting with the first square on the board (not counting the start square). -----Output----- Output a single integer equal to the minimum number of draws required to move from the start square to square $N$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 Blue Orange Pink Green Red Yellow Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 12 Blue Orange Pink Green Red Yellow Yellow Red Green Pink Orange Blue Sample Output 2: 2
