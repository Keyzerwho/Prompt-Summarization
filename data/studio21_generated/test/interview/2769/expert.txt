 Given a struct of integers, find the maximum of the differences of the difficulty levels. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains four space-separated integers $n$, $p$, $q$ ($1 \leq n, p, q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n \leq \min (p, q)$) and $s$ ($0 \leq s \leq 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of days of the camp, $p$ is the number of classical problems, $q$ is the number of creative problems, and $s$ is the maximum sum of difficulties on any given day. Each of the next $p$ lines contains an integer $x$ ($0 \le x \le 10^9$). These are difficulties of the $p$ classical problems. Each of the next $q$ lines contains an integer $y$ ($0 \le y \le 10^9$). These are difficulties of the $q$ creative problems. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the smallest $D$ John can achieve, or $-1$ if there is no way John can select problems for the $n$ training days. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 3 4 4 9 0 1 5 6 6 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 4 4 4 15 1 5 10 12 1 3 10 14 Sample Output 2: 13
