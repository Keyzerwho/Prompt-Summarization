 You are given an $8 \times 8$ board. You need to output the coordinates of the starting location of the turtle. 
-----Input----- The input consists of $8$ lines, which represents the board, with each line representing one row. The turtle will always start out at the bottom-left. There will be exactly $1$ diamond. There will be no more than $10$ ice castles. -----Output----- Output the shortest valid turtle program whose execution (without program error) brings the turtle from the starting location to the diamond! If there are multiple such programs of equal length, you may output any of them! Output no solution if it is not possible for the turtle to reach the diamond! -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: ........ ........ ........ ...CC... ..C.DC.. .C..C... C.IC.... T.C..... Sample Output 1: FLFRXFLFRFLFRF Sample Input 2: ........ ........ ........ ...CC... ..CIDC.. .CI.C... C.IC.... T.C..... Sample Output 2: FLFRXFLXFRFLXFRF Sample Input 3: ........ ........ ........ ...CCD.. ..C..C.. .C..I... C.IC.... T.C..... Sample Output 3: FLFRXFLFRFXFFFLFFLF
