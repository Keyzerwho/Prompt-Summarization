 Given two messages, each consisting of a sequence of encrypted blocks, determine the maximum number of files could be in the archive, if the Zhorik's assumption is correct. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the number of blocks in the first and in the second messages. The second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the length of the blocks that form the first message. The third line contains m integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (1 ≤ y_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the length of the blocks that form the second message. It is guaranteed that x_1 + ... + x_{n} = y_1 + ... + y_{m}. Also, it is guaranteed that x_1 + ... + x_{n} ≤ 10^6. -----Output----- Print the maximum number of files the intercepted array could consist of. -----Examples----- Input 7 6 2 5 3 1 11 4 4 7 8 2 4 1 8 Output 3 Input 3 3 1 10 100 1 100 10 Output 2 Input 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example the maximum number of files in the archive is 3. For example, it is possible that in the archive are three files of sizes 2 + 5 = 7, 15 = 3 + 1 + 11 = 8 + 2 + 4 + 1 and 4 + 4 = 8. In the second example it is possible that the archive contains two files of sizes 1 and 110 = 10 + 100 = 100 + 10. Note that the order of files is kept while transferring archives through the network, so we can't say that there are three files of sizes 1, 10 and 100. In the third example the only possibility is that the archive contains a single file of size 4.
