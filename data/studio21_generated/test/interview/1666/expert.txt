 You are given a positive integers x and y. You need to find all possible outcomes of the game. 
-----Input----- The single line contains four integers x, y, a, b (1 ≤ a ≤ x ≤ 100, 1 ≤ b ≤ y ≤ 100). The numbers on the line are separated by a space. -----Output----- In the first line print integer n — the number of possible outcomes of the game. Then on n lines print the outcomes. On the i-th line print a space-separated pair of integers c_{i}, d_{i} — the number of heads Vasya and Petya got in the i-th outcome of the game, correspondingly. Print pairs of integers (c_{i}, d_{i}) in the strictly increasing order. Let us remind you that the pair of numbers (p_1, q_1) is less than the pair of numbers (p_2, q_2), if p_1 < p_2, or p_1 = p_2 and also q_1 < q_2. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 1 Output 3 2 1 3 1 3 2 Input 2 4 2 2 Output 0
