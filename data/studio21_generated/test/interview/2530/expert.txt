 You are given the subjects of the emails (which represent the country names). Find the country whose chefs got the most number of votes, and also the chef who got elected as the "Chef of the Year" (the chef who got the most number of votes). 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of chefs and the number of emails respectively. Each of the following N lines contains two space-separated strings, denoting the name of the chef and his country respectively. Each of the following M lines contains one string denoting the subject of the email. -----Output----- Output should consist of two lines. The first line should contain the name of the country whose chefs got the most number of votes. The second line should contain the name of the chef who is elected as the "Chef of the Year". -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 (104) - 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000 (105) - Each string in the input contains only letters of English alphabets (uppercase or lowercase) - Each string in the input has length not exceeding 10 - All chef names will be distinct - Subject of each email will coincide with the name of one of the chefs -----Example 1----- Input: 1 3 Leibniz Germany Leibniz Leibniz Leibniz Output: Germany Leibniz -----Example 2----- Input: 4 5 Ramanujan India Torricelli Italy Gauss Germany Lagrange Italy Ramanujan Torricelli Torricelli Ramanujan Lagrange Output: Italy Ramanujan -----Example 3----- Input: 2 2 Newton England Euclid Greece Newton Euclid Output: England Euclid -----Explanation----- Example 1. Here we have only one chef Leibniz and he is from Germany. Clearly, all votes are for him. So Germany is the country-winner and Leibniz is the "Chef of the Year". Example 2. Here we have chefs Torricelli and Lagrange from Italy, chef Ramanujan from India and chef Gauss from Germany. Torricelli got 2 votes, while Lagrange got one vote. Hence the Italy got 3 votes in all. Ramanujan got also 2 votes. And so India got 2 votes in all. Finally Gauss got no votes leaving Germany without votes. So the country-winner is Italy without any ties. But we have two chefs with 2 votes: Torricelli and Ramanujan. But since the string "Ramanujan" is lexicographically smaller than "Torricelli", then Ramanujan is the "Chef of the Year". Example 3. Here we have two countries with 1 vote: England and Greece. Since the string "England" is lexicographically smaller than "Greece", then England is the country-winner. Next, we have two chefs with 1 vote: Newton and Euclid. Since the string "Euclid" is lexicographically smaller than "Newton", then Euclid is the "Chef of the Year".
