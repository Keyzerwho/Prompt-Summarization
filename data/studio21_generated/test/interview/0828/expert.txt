 You are given a list of $n$ integers. You want to split the integers into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list $A$ to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list $B$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers n and s (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ s ≤ n) — the number of workers and the id of the chief. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n - 1), where a_{i} is the number of superiors (not only immediate) the worker with id i reported about. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of workers that could make a mistake. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 0 2 Output 1 Input 5 3 1 0 0 4 1 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example it is possible that only the first worker made a mistake. Then:   the immediate superior of the first worker is the second worker,  the immediate superior of the third worker is the first worker,  the second worker is the chief.
