 You are given $M \times N$ rectangular grid of chocolate blocks. You need to find minimum number of triangular chunks to be cut so that total chocolate is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two space-separated integers $M$ and $N$ given on a single line, (where $1 \leq M, N \leq 10^{18}$). The numbers $M$ and $N$ denote the number of blocks in one column and in one row, respectively, in the chocolate bar. -----Output----- Print the number of blocks of the chocolate bar which are cut into exactly two pieces of equal area. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 10 Sample Output: 2
