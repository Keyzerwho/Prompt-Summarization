 You are given two arrays of integers. You need to find two arrays of integers such that for each pair of positions, the corresponding elements of the first array have the same value, and the corresponding elements of the second array have the same value. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$, $m$ — the number of elements in the array and number of comparisons made by Vasya ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $0 \le m \le 100\,000$). Each of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $a_i$, $b_i$  — the positions of the $i$-th comparison ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$; $a_i \ne b_i$). It's guaranteed that any unordered pair is given in the input at most once. -----Output----- The first line of output must contain "YES" if there exist two arrays, such that the results of comparisons would be the same, and all numbers in the first one are distinct, and the second one contains two equal numbers. Otherwise it must contain "NO". If the arrays exist, the second line must contain the array of distinct integers, the third line must contain the array, that contains at least one pair of equal elements. Elements of the arrays must be integers from $1$ to $n$. -----Examples----- Input 1 0 Output NO Input 3 1 1 2 Output YES 1 3 2  1 3 1  Input 4 3 1 2 1 3 2 4 Output YES 1 3 4 2  1 3 4 1
