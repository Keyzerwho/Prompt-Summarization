 You are given a number $x$ and an integer $y$. Return if $y$ can be obtained from $x$ using the spells. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le 10^9$) — the current number and the number that Petya wants to get. -----Output----- For the $i$-th test case print the answer on it — YES if Petya can get the number $y$ from the number $x$ using known spells, and NO otherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer). -----Example----- Input 7 2 3 1 1 3 6 6 8 1 2 4 1 31235 6578234 Output YES YES NO YES NO YES YES
