 You are given numbers m and n. You are given an array of strings of only 0's and 1's. Return the maximum number of artists that can be killed, so that there are no artists in the room when Ilia calls. 
-----Input----- The only string contains three integers — n, m and z (1 ≤ n, m, z ≤ 10^4). -----Output----- Print single integer — the minimum number of artists that should be killed so that there are no artists in the room when Ilia calls. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 10 Output 10 Input 1 2 5 Output 2 Input 2 3 9 Output 1 -----Note----- Taymyr is a place in the north of Russia. In the first test the artists come each minute, as well as the calls, so we need to kill all of them. In the second test we need to kill artists which come on the second and the fourth minutes. In the third test — only the artist which comes on the sixth minute.
