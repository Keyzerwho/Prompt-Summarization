 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the initial number of legs in the table Arthur bought. The second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers l_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ 10^5), where l_{i} is equal to the length of the i-th leg of the table. The third line of the input contains a sequence of n integers d_{i} (1 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 200), where d_{i} is the number of energy units that Arthur spends on removing the i-th leg off the table. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of energy units that Arthur needs to spend in order to make the table stable. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 5 3 2 Output 2 Input 3 2 4 4 1 1 1 Output 0 Input 6 2 2 1 1 3 3 4 3 5 5 2 1 Output 8
