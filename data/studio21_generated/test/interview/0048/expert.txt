 You are given an n   m multiplication table, where the element on the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column equals i j (the rows and columns of the table are numbered starting from 1). You are asked to write out the k-th largest number in the table.
-----Input----- The single line contains integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5·10^5; 1 ≤ k ≤ n·m). -----Output----- Print the k-th largest number in a n × m multiplication table. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 2 Output 2 Input 2 3 4 Output 3 Input 1 10 5 Output 5 -----Note----- A 2 × 3 multiplication table looks like this: 1 2 3 2 4 6
