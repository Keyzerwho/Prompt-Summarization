 You are given a sequence of integers. You need to cut this sequence into segments such that each segment has the same number of odd and even numbers. The cost of each cut is $|x - y|$ bitcoins. Find the maximum possible number of cuts that can be made while spending no more than $B$ bitcoins. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) and an integer $B$ ($1 \le B \le 100$) — the number of elements in the sequence and the number of bitcoins you have. Second line contains $n$ integers: $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — elements of the sequence, which contains the equal number of even and odd numbers -----Output----- Print the maximum possible number of cuts which can be made while spending no more than $B$ bitcoins. -----Examples----- Input 6 4 1 2 5 10 15 20 Output 1 Input 4 10 1 3 2 4 Output 0 Input 6 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample the optimal answer is to split sequence between $2$ and $5$. Price of this cut is equal to $3$ bitcoins. In the second sample it is not possible to make even one cut even with unlimited number of bitcoins. In the third sample the sequence should be cut between $2$ and $3$, and between $4$ and $5$. The total price of the cuts is $1 + 1 = 2$ bitcoins.
