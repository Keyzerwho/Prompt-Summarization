 You are given $n$ numbers $y_1$, ..., $y_n$. For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether $y_i$ can be a permutation of a number divisible by $60$ (possibly with leading zeroes). 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 418$) — the number of grandmasters Bob asked. Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which contains a single integer $y_i$ — the number that Alice wrote down. Each of these numbers has between $2$ and $100$ digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes. -----Output----- Output $n$ lines. For each $i$, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of $y_i$ such that the resulting number is divisible by $60$, output "red" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output "cyan". -----Example----- Input 6 603 006 205 228 1053 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Output red red cyan cyan cyan red -----Note----- In the first example, there is one rearrangement that yields a number divisible by $60$, and that is $360$. In the second example, there are two solutions. One is $060$ and the second is $600$. In the third example, there are $6$ possible rearrangments: $025$, $052$, $205$, $250$, $502$, $520$. None of these numbers is divisible by $60$. In the fourth example, there are $3$ rearrangements: $228$, $282$, $822$. In the fifth example, none of the $24$ rearrangements result in a number divisible by $60$. In the sixth example, note that $000\dots0$ is a valid solution.
