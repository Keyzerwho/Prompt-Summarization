 You are given two integers (x_1, x_2) and (x_3, x_4). Determine the minimum total tiredness they should gain, if they meet in the same point. summary :  
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the initial position of the first friend.  The second line contains a single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the initial position of the second friend. It is guaranteed that a ≠ b. -----Output----- Print the minimum possible total tiredness if the friends meet in the same point. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 Output 1 Input 101 99 Output 2 Input 5 10 Output 9 -----Note----- In the first example the first friend should move by one to the right (then the meeting happens at point 4), or the second friend should move by one to the left (then the meeting happens at point 3). In both cases, the total tiredness becomes 1. In the second example the first friend should move by one to the left, and the second friend should move by one to the right. Then they meet in the point 100, and the total tiredness becomes 1 + 1 = 2. In the third example one of the optimal ways is the following. The first friend should move three times to the right, and the second friend — two times to the left. Thus the friends meet in the point 8, and the total tiredness becomes 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 9.
