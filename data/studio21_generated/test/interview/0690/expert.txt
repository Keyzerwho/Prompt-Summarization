 You are given a number n. Write a program that prints the way Soroban shows the given number n. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (0 â‰¤ n < 10^9). -----Output----- Print the description of the decimal digits of number n from the last one to the first one (as mentioned on the picture in the statement), one per line. Print the beads as large English letters 'O', rod pieces as character '-' and the reckoning bar as '|'. Print as many rods, as many digits are in the decimal representation of number n without leading zeroes. We can assume that number 0 has no leading zeroes. -----Examples----- Input 2 Output O-|OO-OO Input 13 Output O-|OOO-O O-|O-OOO Input 720 Output O-|-OOOO O-|OO-OO -O|OO-OO
