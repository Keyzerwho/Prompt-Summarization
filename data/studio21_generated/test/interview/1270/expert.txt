 Given an integer n represent it as a sum of maximum possible number of prime numbers. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). -----Output----- The first line of the output contains a single integer k — maximum possible number of primes in representation. The second line should contain k primes with their sum equal to n. You can print them in any order. If there are several optimal solution, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 Output 2 2 3 Input 6 Output 3 2 2 2
