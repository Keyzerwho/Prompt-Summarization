 Your task is to find the number of pairs of integers (i,j) (1 \leq i < j \leq N) such that the shortest distance between Vertex i and Vertex j in G is k.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N X Y -----Output----- For each k=1, 2, ..., N-1 in this order, print a line containing the answer to the problem. -----Sample Input----- 5 2 4 -----Sample Output----- 5 4 1 0 The graph in this input is as follows: There are five pairs (i,j) (1 \leq i < j \leq N) such that the shortest distance between Vertex i and Vertex j is 1: (1,2)\,,(2,3)\,,(2,4)\,,(3,4)\,,(4,5). There are four pairs (i,j) (1 \leq i < j \leq N) such that the shortest distance between Vertex i and Vertex j is 2: (1,3)\,,(1,4)\,,(2,5)\,,(3,5). There is one pair (i,j) (1 \leq i < j \leq N) such that the shortest distance between Vertex i and Vertex j is 3: (1,5). There are no pairs (i,j) (1 \leq i < j \leq N) such that the shortest distance between Vertex i and Vertex j is 4.
