 You are given N cities and a distance matrix A with N rows and N columns. The matrix A represents the shortest distances between the cities. Determine whether there exists a road network such that for each u and v, the integer A_{u, v} at the u-th row and v-th column of A is equal to the length of the shortest path from City u to City v. If such a network exist, find the shortest possible total length of the roads. 
-----Inputs----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} ... A_{1, N} A_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} ... A_{2, N} ... A_{N, 1} A_{N, 2} ... A_{N, N} -----Outputs----- If there exists no network that satisfies the condition, print -1. If it exists, print the shortest possible total length of the roads. -----Sample Input----- 3 0 1 3 1 0 2 3 2 0 -----Sample Output----- 3 The network below satisfies the condition:  - City 1 and City 2 is connected by a road of length 1.  - City 2 and City 3 is connected by a road of length 2.  - City 3 and City 1 is not connected by a road.
