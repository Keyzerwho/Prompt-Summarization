 You are given two numbers x and y. Now, draw a straight line $y = - \frac{x}{m} + b$. Now, you can cut all the trees that are inside or on the border of this rectangle and take their bananas. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers m and b (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 10000). -----Output----- Print the maximum number of bananas Okabe can get from the trees he cuts. -----Examples----- Input 1 5 Output 30 Input 2 3 Output 25 -----Note----- [Image]  The graph above corresponds to sample test 1. The optimal rectangle is shown in red and has 30 bananas.
