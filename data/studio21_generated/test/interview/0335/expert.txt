 You are given an integer $n$. You need to find positive integers $a,b,c$ such that $a+b+c=n$ and none of the $3$ integers is a multiple of $3$. 
-----Input----- A single line containing one integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 10^9$) â€” the integer Little C has. -----Output----- Print $3$ positive integers $a,b,c$ in a single line, such that $a+b+c=n$ and none of them is a multiple of $3$. It can be proved that there is at least one solution. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 Output 1 1 1 Input 233 Output 77 77 79
