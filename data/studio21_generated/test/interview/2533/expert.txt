 You are given a description of the road network of Mancunia. You need to come up with a scheme to redirect some (possibly none) of the roads to make it tourist-friendly. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers N and E denoting the number of cities and roads in the beautiful country of Mancunia respectively. Each of the next E lines contains two integers a and b implying that there is a unidirectional road from city a to city b. It is guaranteed that there aren't multiple roads in the exact same direction and that there is no road from a city to itself. -----Output----- If there is no solution, print "NO" (without quotes). Else, print "YES" (without quotes), followed by exactly E lines. The ith line of output should represent the ith road in the input. It should have two integers a and b denoting that the final orientation of that road is from a to b. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 - 1 ≤ E ≤ 200000 - 1 ≤ a, b ≤ N Subtask 1: (20 points) - 1 ≤ N ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ E ≤ 21 Subtask 2: (80 points) - Same as original constraints -----Example 1----- Input: 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 Output: YES 1 2 2 3 3 1 -----Example 2----- Input: 3 2 1 2 2 3 Output: NO -----Example 3----- Input: 5 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 2 4 2 5 1 5 Output: YES 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 2 2 5 5 1
