 Given a circular table, find minimal number of people that must switch seats so that the teams are lined up correctly. 
-----Input-----  - The first line of the input contains the integer $n$, where $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$ is the number of players (as well as seats).  - The second line contains a string of length $n$, consisting only of the characters in ABC. This indicates the teams of the people sitting around the table in order. -----Output----- Print a single integer: the minimal number of people you have to ask to move seats to make sure the teams sit together. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 ABABC Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 12 ABCABCABCABC Sample Output 2: 6 Sample Input 3: 4 ACBA Sample Output 3: 0 Sample Input 4: 6 BABABA Sample Output 4: 2
