 You are given a string. Find the sum of simple prettiness of all the substrings of the song.   
-----Input----- The input contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5·10^5) — the title of the song. -----Output----- Print the prettiness of the song with the absolute or relative error of at most 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input IEAIAIO Output 28.0000000 Input BYOB Output 5.8333333 Input YISVOWEL Output 17.0500000 -----Note----- In the first sample all letters are vowels. The simple prettiness of each substring is 1. The word of length 7 has 28 substrings. So, the prettiness of the song equals to 28.
