 You are given N values with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$; $0 \le k \le 10^9$) — the total number of moves and the number of candies in the box at the end.  It's guaranteed, that for the given $n$ and $k$ the answer exists. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of candies, which Alya ate. Please note, that in this problem there aren't multiple possible answers — the answer is unique for any input data.  -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 0 Input 9 11 Output 4 Input 5 0 Output 3 Input 3 2 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example, Alya has made one move only. According to the statement, the first move is always putting one candy in the box. Hence Alya ate $0$ candies. In the second example the possible sequence of Alya's actions looks as follows:   put $1$ candy,  put $2$ candies,  eat a candy,  eat a candy,  put $3$ candies,  eat a candy,  put $4$ candies,  eat a candy,  put $5$ candies.   This way, she will make exactly $n=9$ actions and in the end the box will contain $1+2-1-1+3-1+4-1+5=11$ candies. The answer is $4$, since she ate $4$ candies in total.
