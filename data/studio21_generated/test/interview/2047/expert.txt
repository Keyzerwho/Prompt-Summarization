 You have n materials numbered from 1 to n. Each material can be transformed into another material, or into another material. You need to figure out if it is possible to conduct an experiment after transforming some materials(or none). 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of materials discovered by Berland chemists. The second line contains n integer numbers b_1, b_2... b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^12) — supplies of BerSU laboratory. The third line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2... a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^12) — the amounts required for the experiment. Then n - 1 lines follow. j-th of them contains two numbers x_{j} + 1 and k_{j} + 1 that denote transformation of (j + 1)-th material (1 ≤ x_{j} + 1 ≤ j, 1 ≤ k_{j} + 1 ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print YES if it is possible to conduct an experiment. Otherwise print NO. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 Output YES Input 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 2 Output NO
