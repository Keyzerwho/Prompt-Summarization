 You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the employee i. Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). -----Output----- Print a single line containing "Akshat" or "Malvika" (without the quotes), depending on the winner of the game. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 Output Malvika Input 2 3 Output Malvika Input 3 3 Output Akshat -----Note----- Explanation of the first sample: The grid has four intersection points, numbered from 1 to 4.  [Image]  If Akshat chooses intersection point 1, then he will remove two sticks (1 - 2 and 1 - 3). The resulting grid will look like this.  [Image]  Now there is only one remaining intersection point (i.e. 4). Malvika must choose it and remove both remaining sticks. After her move the grid will be empty. In the empty grid, Akshat cannot make any move, hence he will lose. Since all 4 intersection points of the grid are equivalent, Akshat will lose no matter which one he picks.
