 You are given an array with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. The array contains the squares of size $1\times1$. You are given an array with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. The array contains the squares of size $1\times1$. Each square is numbered (starting from 1). Each square has $n$ streets. Each street has length $1$. The streets are marked as green. Each lantern is numbered (starting from 1). Each lantern is put at the center of one of the streets. Each lantern lights two squares near it (or only one square if it stands on the border of the park). The squares marked by yellow are not lighted. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow. Each test case is a line containing two integers $n$, $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^4$) — park sizes. -----Output----- Print $t$ answers to the test cases. Each answer must be a single integer — the minimum number of lanterns that are required to light all the squares. -----Example----- Input 5 1 1 1 3 2 2 3 3 5 3 Output 1 2 2 5 8 -----Note----- Possible optimal arrangement of the lanterns for the $2$-nd test case of input data example: [Image] Possible optimal arrangement of the lanterns for the $3$-rd test case of input data example: [Image]
