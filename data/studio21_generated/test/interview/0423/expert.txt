 The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, |k| ≤ 10 000) — the size of the polynomial and the integer k. The i-th of the following n + 1 lines contain character '?' if the coefficient near x^{i} - 1 is yet undefined or the integer value a_{i}, if the coefficient is already known ( - 10 000 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10 000). Each of integers a_{i} (and even a_{n}) may be equal to 0. Please note, that it's not guaranteed that you are given the position of the game where it's computer's turn to move. -----Output----- Print "Yes" (without quotes) if the human has winning strategy, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 -1 ? Output Yes Input 2 100 -10000 0 1 Output Yes Input 4 5 ? 1 ? 1 ? Output No -----Note----- In the first sample, computer set a_0 to  - 1 on the first move, so if human can set coefficient a_1 to 0.5 and win. In the second sample, all coefficients are already set and the resulting polynomial is divisible by x - 100, so the human has won.
