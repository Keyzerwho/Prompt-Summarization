 You are given a 2D plane. You are given Fafa's laptop. You are given Fifa's access point. You are given the world. Find the position and the radius chosen by Fifa for his access point which minimizes the uncovered area. 
-----Input----- The single line of the input contains 5 space-separated integers R, x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 ≤ R ≤ 10^5, |x_1|, |y_1|, |x_2|, |y_2| ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- Print three space-separated numbers x_{ap}, y_{ap}, r where (x_{ap}, y_{ap}) is the position which Fifa chose for the access point and r is the radius of its range.  Your answer will be considered correct if the radius does not differ from optimal more than 10^{ - 6} absolutely or relatively, and also the radius you printed can be changed by no more than 10^{ - 6} (absolutely or relatively) in such a way that all points outside the flat and Fafa's laptop position are outside circle of the access point range. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 3 1 1 Output 3.7677669529663684 3.7677669529663684 3.914213562373095 Input 10 5 5 5 15 Output 5.0 5.0 10.0
