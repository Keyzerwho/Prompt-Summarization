 You are given 3 sets of times. 1) Times when ZS the Coder typed words. 2) Times when ZS the Coder typed nothing. 3) Times when ZS the Coder typed 2 words. You need to output the number of words on the screen after he finished typing everything.
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and c (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9) — the number of words ZS the Coder typed and the crazy computer delay respectively. The next line contains n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (1 ≤ t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_{n} ≤ 10^9), where t_{i} denotes the second when ZS the Coder typed the i-th word. -----Output----- Print a single positive integer, the number of words that remain on the screen after all n words was typed, in other words, at the second t_{n}. -----Examples----- Input 6 5 1 3 8 14 19 20 Output 3 Input 6 1 1 3 5 7 9 10 Output 2 -----Note----- The first sample is already explained in the problem statement. For the second sample, after typing the first word at the second 1, it disappears because the next word is typed at the second 3 and 3 - 1 > 1. Similarly, only 1 word will remain at the second 9. Then, a word is typed at the second 10, so there will be two words on the screen, as the old word won't disappear because 10 - 9 ≤ 1.
