 You are given $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. $a_i$ is the number of monsters in the $i$-th wave. $a_i < a_{i + 1}$ for all $i$. $a_1 = 0$. $a_2 = 1$. $a_3 = 2$. $a_4 = 3$. $a_5 = 4$. $a_6 = 5$. $a_7 = 6$. $a_8 = 7$. $a_9 = 8$. $a_{10} = 9$. $a_{11} = 10$. $a_{12} = 11$. $a_{13} = 12$. $a_{14} = 13$. $a_{15} = 14$. $a_{16} = 15$. $a_{17} = 16
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2000$; $1 \le k \le 10^9$) — the number of waves and magazine size. The next $n$ lines contain descriptions of waves. The $i$-th line contains three integers $l_i$, $r_i$ and $a_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 10^9$; $1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the period of time when the $i$-th wave happens and the number of monsters in it. It's guaranteed that waves don't overlap (but may touch) and are given in the order they occur, i. e. $r_i \le l_{i + 1}$. -----Output----- If there is no way to clear all waves, print $-1$. Otherwise, print the minimum possible number of bullets you need to spend (both used and thrown) to clear all waves. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 2 3 6 3 4 3 Output 9 Input 2 5 3 7 11 10 12 15 Output 30 Input 5 42 42 42 42 42 43 42 43 44 42 44 45 42 45 45 1 Output -1 Input 1 10 100 111 1 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example:   At the moment $2$, the first wave occurs and $6$ monsters spawn. You kill $3$ monsters and start reloading.  At the moment $3$, the second wave occurs and $3$ more monsters spawn. You kill remaining $3$ monsters from the first wave and start reloading.  At the moment $4$, you kill remaining $3$ monsters from the second wave.  In total, you'll spend $9$ bullets. In the second example:   At moment $3$, the first wave occurs and $11$ monsters spawn. You kill $5$ monsters and start reloading.  At moment $4$, you kill $5$ more monsters and start reloading.  At moment $5$, you kill the last monster and start reloading throwing away old magazine with $4$ bullets.  At moment $10$, the second wave occurs and $15$ monsters spawn. You kill $5$ monsters and start reloading.  At moment $11$, you kill $5$ more monsters and start reloading.  At moment $12$, you kill last $5$ monsters.  In total, you'll spend $30$ bullets.
