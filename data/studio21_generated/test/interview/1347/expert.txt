 Your task is to find the minimum length essay containing minimum number of  R s. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of words in the initial essay. The second line contains words of the essay. The words are separated by a single space. It is guaranteed that the total length of the words won't exceed 10^5 characters. The next line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of pairs of words in synonym dictionary. The i-th of the next n lines contains two space-separated non-empty words x_{i} and y_{i}. They mean that word x_{i} can be replaced with word y_{i} (but not vise versa). It is guaranteed that the total length of all pairs of synonyms doesn't exceed 5·10^5 characters. All the words at input can only consist of uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet. -----Output----- Print two integers — the minimum number of letters «R» in an optimal essay and the minimum length of an optimal essay. -----Examples----- Input 3 AbRb r Zz 4 xR abRb aA xr zz Z xr y Output 2 6 Input 2 RuruRu fedya 1 ruruRU fedor Output 1 10
