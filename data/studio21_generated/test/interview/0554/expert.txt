 You are given an array of n flowers. Each flower has some mood, the mood of i-th flower is a_{i}. The mood can be positive, zero or negative. Let's define a subarray as a segment of consecutive flowers. The girl wants to choose several of the subarrays suggested by her mother. After that, each of the flowers will add to the girl's happiness its mood multiplied by the number of chosen subarrays the flower is in. For example, consider the case when the mother has 5 flowers, and their moods are equal to 1,  - 2, 1, 3,  - 4. Suppose the mother suggested subarrays (1,  - 2), (3,  - 4), (1, 3), (1,  - 2, 1, 3). Then if the girl chooses the third and the fourth subarrays then:   the first flower adds 1 1 = 1 to the girl's happiness, because he is in one of chosen subarrays,  the second flower adds ( - 2) 1
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of flowers and the number of subarrays suggested by the mother. The second line contains the flowers moods — n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100). The next m lines contain the description of the subarrays suggested by the mother. The i-th of these lines contain two integers l_{i} and r_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n) denoting the subarray a[l_{i}], a[l_{i} + 1], ..., a[r_{i}]. Each subarray can encounter more than once. -----Output----- Print single integer — the maximum possible value added to the Alyona's happiness. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 1 -2 1 3 -4 1 2 4 5 3 4 1 4 Output 7 Input 4 3 1 2 3 4 1 3 2 4 1 1 Output 16 Input 2 2 -1 -2 1 1 1 2 Output 0 -----Note----- The first example is the situation described in the statements. In the second example Alyona should choose all subarrays. The third example has answer 0 because Alyona can choose none of the subarrays.
