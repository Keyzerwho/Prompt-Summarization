 You are given a list of $n$ integers. In one step, you can either increment or decrement an integer. Return the minimum number of steps required before all integers in the list are positive.   
-----Input----- The first line consists the number of people $n$ ($1\le n\le 100$) and the number of trees $m$ ($1 \le m \le 100$). The next line contains $n$ integers $p_1,p_2,\ldots ,p_ n$, the positions of all the people when the music stops ($1 \le p_ i \le 1000$). The last line contains $m$ integers $t_1,t_2,\ldots ,t_ m$, the positions of all the trees ($1 \le t_ i \le 1000$). No two people or two trees will have the same position. Some people may try to cheat though, and will already be at the same position as a tree when the music stops. Note that if a person has more than one closest tree to them, they will always go for the one with the smallest $t_ i$. -----Output----- Output the number of people who wonâ€™t get a tree. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 3 1 4 2 4 5 Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 3 2 1 5 10 4 6 Sample Output 2: 1
