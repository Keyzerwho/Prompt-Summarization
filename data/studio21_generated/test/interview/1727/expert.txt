 You are given a list of integers. Return the maximum number of trees to fell. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of trees. Next n lines contain pairs of integers x_{i}, h_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the coordinate and the height of the і-th tree. The pairs are given in the order of ascending x_{i}. No two trees are located at the point with the same coordinate. -----Output----- Print a single number — the maximum number of trees that you can cut down by the given rules. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 2 1 5 10 10 9 19 1 Output 3 Input 5 1 2 2 1 5 10 10 9 20 1 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample you can fell the trees like that:   fell the 1-st tree to the left — now it occupies segment [ - 1;1]  fell the 2-nd tree to the right — now it occupies segment [2;3]  leave the 3-rd tree — it occupies point 5  leave the 4-th tree — it occupies point 10  fell the 5-th tree to the right — now it occupies segment [19;20]  In the second sample you can also fell 4-th tree to the right, after that it will occupy segment [10;19].
