 JATC loves Banh-mi (a Vietnamese food). His affection for Banh-mi is so much that he always has it for breakfast. This morning, as usual, he buys a Banh-mi and decides to enjoy it in a special way. First, he splits the Banh-mi into $n$ parts, places them on a row and numbers them from $1$ through $n$. For each part $i$, he defines the deliciousness of the part as $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$. JATC's going to eat those parts one by one. At each step, he chooses arbitrary remaining part and eats it. Suppose that part is the $i$-th part then his enjoyment of the Banh-mi will increase by $x_i$ and the deliciousness of all the remaining parts will also increase by $x_i$. The initial enjoyment of JATC is equal to $0$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, q \le 100\,000$). The second line contains a string of $n$ characters, each character is either '0' or '1'. The $i$-th character defines the deliciousness of the $i$-th part. Each of the following $q$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) — the segment of the corresponding query. -----Output----- Print $q$ lines, where $i$-th of them contains a single integer — the answer to the $i$-th query modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 1011 1 4 3 4 Output 14 3 Input 3 2 111 1 2 3 3 Output 3 1 -----Note----- In the first example:   For query $1$: One of the best ways for JATC to eats those parts is in this order: $1$, $4$, $3$, $2$.  For query $2$: Both $3$, $4$ and $4$, $3$ ordering give the same answer.  In the second example, any order of eating parts leads to the same answer.
