 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one string which describes the card on the table. The second line contains five strings which describe the cards in your hand. Each string is two characters long. The first character denotes the rank and belongs to the set $\{{\tt 2}, {\tt 3}, {\tt 4}, {\tt 5}, {\tt 6}, {\tt 7}, {\tt 8}, {\tt 9}, {\tt T}, {\tt J}, {\tt Q}, {\tt K}, {\tt A}\}$. The second character denotes the suit and belongs to the set $\{{\tt D}, {\tt C}, {\tt S}, {\tt H}\}$. All the cards in the input are different. -----Output----- If it is possible to play a card from your hand, print one word "YES". Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input AS 2H 4C TH JH AD Output YES Input 2H 3D 4C AC KD AS Output NO Input 4D AS AC AD AH 5H Output YES -----Note----- In the first example, there is an Ace of Spades (AS) on the table. You can play an Ace of Diamonds (AD) because both of them are Aces. In the second example, you cannot play any card. In the third example, you can play an Ace of Diamonds (AD) because it has the same suit as a Four of Diamonds (4D), which lies on the table.
