 You are given an array with integers. Each integer represents a time (in seconds). You are required to find first minute $y$ and index $j$ such that if Ivan sets his alarm clock with properties $y$ and $p_j$ it will ring during all given minutes $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the number of events and the number of possible settings for the interval between signals. The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($1 \le x_i \le 10^{18}$), where $x_i$ is the minute when $i$-th event starts. It is guaranteed that all $x_i$ are given in increasing order (i. e. the condition $x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n$ holds). The third line of the input contains $m$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_m$ ($1 \le p_j \le 10^{18}$), where $p_j$ is the $j$-th option for the interval between two consecutive signals. -----Output----- If it's impossible to choose such values $y$ and $j$ so all constraints are satisfied, print "NO" in the first line. Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. Then print two integers $y$ ($1 \le y \le 10^{18}$) and $j$ ($1 \le j \le m$) in the second line, where $y$ is the first minute Ivan's alarm clock should start ringing and $j$ is the index of the option for the interval between two consecutive signals (options are numbered from $1$ to $m$ in the order they are given input). These values should be chosen in such a way that the alarm clock will ring during all given minutes $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. If there are multiple answers, you can print any. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 3 12 18 2 6 5 3 3 Output YES 3 4 Input 4 2 1 5 17 19 4 5 Output NO Input 4 2 1 5 17 19 2 1 Output YES 1 1
