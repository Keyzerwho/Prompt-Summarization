 AtCoDeer the deer and his friend TopCoDeer is playing a game. The game consists of N turns. In each turn, each player plays one of the two gestures, Rock and Paper, as in Rock-paper-scissors, under the following condition: ( ) After each turn, (the number of times the player has played Paper) (the number of times the player has played Rock). Each player's score is calculated by (the number of turns where the player wins) - (the number of turns where the player loses), where the outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of Rock-paper-scissors.
