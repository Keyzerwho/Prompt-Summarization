 You are given an array consisting of n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty. Each step you selects a non-empty array cell with the maximum index and moves the number written in it to the nearest empty cell to the left of the selected one. The process continues until all n numbers will appear in the first n cells of the array. For example if n = 4, the array is changing as follows: [Image]  You have to write a program that allows you to determine what number and type of boxes Dima should buy to transport maximum number of hamsters.
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers N and K (0 ≤ N ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^5) — the number of hamsters that will grow up on Dima's farm and the number of types of boxes that the factory produces. The second line contains K integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{K} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^18 for all i) — the capacities of boxes. -----Output----- Output two integers: the type of boxes that Dima should buy and the number of boxes of that type Dima should buy. Types of boxes are numbered from 1 to K in the order they are given in input. If there are many correct answers, output any of them. -----Examples----- Input 19 3 5 4 10 Output 2 4 Input 28 3 5 6 30 Output 1 5
