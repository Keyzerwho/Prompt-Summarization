 You are given a list of integers and $k$. Find the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments that are good for Maxim. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains two integers: n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ k ≤ n). -----Output----- Print the minimum possible and the maximum possible number of apartments good for Maxim. -----Example----- Input 6 3 Output 1 3 -----Note----- In the sample test, the number of good apartments could be minimum possible if, for example, apartments with indices 1, 2 and 3 were inhabited. In this case only apartment 4 is good. The maximum possible number could be, for example, if apartments with indices 1, 3 and 5 were inhabited. In this case all other apartments: 2, 4 and 6 are good.
