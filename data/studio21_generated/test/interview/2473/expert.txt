 You are given N points in a two dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th point (1 \leq i \leq N) are (x_i,y_i). Let us consider a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes that contains K or more of the N points in its interior. Here, points on the sides of the rectangle are considered to be in the interior. Find the minimum possible area of such a rectangle. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:   N K   x_1 y_1 :   x_{N} y_{N} -----Output----- Print the minimum possible area of a rectangle that satisfies the condition.   -----Sample Input----- 4 4 1 4 3 3 6 2 8 1 -----Sample Output----- 21 One rectangle that satisfies the condition with the minimum possible area has the following vertices: (1,1), (8,1), (1,4) and (8,4). Its area is (8-1) Ã— (4-1) = 21.
