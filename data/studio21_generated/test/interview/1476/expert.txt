 You are given an array of integers. You are asked to choose the maximum number of students and make such an arrangement of students in the room that no two students with adjacent numbers sit side by side. 
-----Input----- A single line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of students at an exam. -----Output----- In the first line print integer k — the maximum number of students who can be seated so that no two students with adjacent numbers sit next to each other. In the second line print k distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n), where a_{i} is the number of the student on the i-th position. The students on adjacent positions mustn't have adjacent numbers. Formally, the following should be true: |a_{i} - a_{i} + 1| ≠ 1 for all i from 1 to k - 1. If there are several possible answers, output any of them. -----Examples----- Input 6 Output 6 1 5 3 6 2 4 Input 3 Output 2 1 3
