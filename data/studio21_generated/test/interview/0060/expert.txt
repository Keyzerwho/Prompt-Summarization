 You are given a plane with rows numbered from 1 to n, where n is infinite. You are given two flight attendants, Vasya and Alena. They serve food from row 1 to row n. Each flight attendant first serves passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle. Flight attendants work with the same speed: it takes exactly 1 second to serve one passenger and 1 second to move one row forward. Each attendant first serves the passengers on the seats to the right of the aisle and then serves passengers on the seats to the left of the aisle (if one looks in the direction of the cockpit). Moreover, they always serve passengers in order from the window to the aisle. 
-----Input----- The only line of input contains a description of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) is the index of the row and s is the seat in this row, denoted as letter from 'a' to 'f'. The index of the row and the seat are not separated by a space. -----Output----- Print one integer — the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch. -----Examples----- Input 1f Output 1 Input 2d Output 10 Input 4a Output 11 Input 5e Output 18 -----Note----- In the first sample, the first flight attendant serves Vasya first, so Vasya gets his lunch after 1 second. In the second sample, the flight attendants will spend 6 seconds to serve everyone in the rows 1 and 3, then they will move one row forward in 1 second. As they first serve seats located to the right of the aisle in order from window to aisle, Vasya has to wait 3 more seconds. The total is 6 + 1 + 3 = 10.
