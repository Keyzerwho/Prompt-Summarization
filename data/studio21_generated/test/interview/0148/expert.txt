 You are given a list of integers. You need to check if two trains will ever stop at the same station at the same time. 
-----Input----- The first line contains five space-separated integers $n$, $a$, $x$, $b$, $y$ ($4 \leq n \leq 100$, $1 \leq a, x, b, y \leq n$, all numbers among $a$, $x$, $b$, $y$ are distinct) — the number of stations in Roflanpolis, Daniel's start station, Daniel's finish station, Vlad's start station and Vlad's finish station, respectively. -----Output----- Output "YES" if there is a time moment when Vlad and Daniel are at the same station, and "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 5 1 4 3 2 Output YES Input 10 2 1 9 10 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example, Daniel and Vlad start at the stations $(1, 3)$. One minute later they are at stations $(2, 2)$. They are at the same station at this moment. Note that Vlad leaves the subway right after that. Consider the second example, let's look at the stations Vlad and Daniel are at. They are:   initially $(2, 9)$,  after $1$ minute $(3, 8)$,  after $2$ minutes $(4, 7)$,  after $3$ minutes $(5, 6)$,  after $4$ minutes $(6, 5)$,  after $5$ minutes $(7, 4)$,  after $6$ minutes $(8, 3)$,  after $7$ minutes $(9, 2)$,  after $8$ minutes $(10, 1)$,  after $9$ minutes $(1, 10)$.  After that, they both leave the subway because they are at their finish stations, so there is no moment when they both are at the same station.
