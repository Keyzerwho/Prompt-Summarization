 You are given a list of $N$ integers. You need to find the number of different subsequences of odd length whose median is $B$. The median of a sequence is the element in the middle of the sequence after it is sorted. For example, the median of the sequence $(5, 1, 3)$ is $3$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100000$) and $B$ ($1 \le B \le N$). The second line contains $N$ integers separated by spaces, the elements of sequence $A$. -----Output----- Output the number of subsequences of $A$ whose median is $B$. -----Explanation of Sample Input----- In Sample Input 3, the four subsequences of $A$ with median $4$ are $(4)$, $(7, 2, 4)$, $(5, 7, 2, 4, 3)$ and $(5, 7, 2, 4, 3, 1, 6)$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 4 1 2 3 4 5 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 6 3 1 2 4 5 6 3 Sample Output 2: 1
