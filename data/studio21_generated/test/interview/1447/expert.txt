 You are given n, m and n different cards. Your task is to calculate the probability that the trick is successful. 
-----Input----- First line of the input consists of two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000), separated by space — number of cards in each deck, and number of decks. -----Output----- On the only line of the output print one floating point number – probability of Alex successfully performing the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be higher than 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 Output 0.6666666666666666 Input 4 4 Output 0.4000000000000000 Input 1 2 Output 1.0000000000000000 -----Note----- In the first sample, with probability $\frac{1}{3}$ Alex will perform the trick with two cards with the same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed to succeed. With the remaining $\frac{2}{3}$ probability he took two different cards, and the probability of pulling off the trick is $\frac{1}{2}$. The resulting probability is $\frac{1}{3} \times 1 + \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3}$
