 You are given $n$ integers $m_i$ and $n$ integers $a_i$. You need to return $n$ integers $x_i$ such that $1 \le x_i \le m_i$ and $1 \le x_i \le a_i$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 500\,000$) — the number of plots. The second line contains the integers $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n$ ($1 \leq m_i \leq 10^9$) — the limit on the number of floors for every possible number of floors for a skyscraper on each plot. -----Output----- Print $n$ integers $a_i$ — the number of floors in the plan for each skyscraper, such that all requirements are met, and the total number of floors in all skyscrapers is the maximum possible. If there are multiple answers possible, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 2 1 Output 1 2 3 2 1  Input 3 10 6 8 Output 10 6 6  -----Note----- In the first example, you can build all skyscrapers with the highest possible height. In the second test example, you cannot give the maximum height to all skyscrapers as this violates the design code restriction. The answer $[10, 6, 6]$ is optimal. Note that the answer of $[6, 6, 8]$ also satisfies all restrictions, but is not optimal.
