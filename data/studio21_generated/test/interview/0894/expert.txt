 Given a triangle, find two integers inside it so that the following conditions hold:  the coordinates of points: x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 are integers. Besides, the following inequation holds: x_1 < x_2;  the triangle formed by point A, B and C is rectangular and isosceles ($\angle A B C$ is right);  all points of the favorite rectangle are located inside or on the border of triangle ABC;  the area of triangle ABC is as small as possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers x, y ( - 10^9 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0). -----Output----- Print in the single line four integers x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 — the coordinates of the required points. -----Examples----- Input 10 5 Output 0 15 15 0 Input -10 5 Output -15 0 0 15 -----Note----- [Image] Figure to the first sample
