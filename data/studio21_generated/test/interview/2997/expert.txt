 Alice and Bob are playing a game on a simple connected graph with N nodes and M edges. Alice colors each edge in the graph red or blue. A path is a sequence of edges where each pair of consecutive edges have a node in common. If the first edge in the pair is of a different color than the second edge, then that is a  color change.  Alice wants to choose an edge coloring to maximize the number of color changes Bob must make. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer values $N$ and $M$ with $2 \le N \le 100000$ and $1 \le M \le 100000$. The next $M$ lines contain two integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ indicating an undirected edge between nodes $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ ($1 \le a_ i, b_ i \le N$, $a_ i \not= b_ i$). All edges in the graph are unique. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of color changes Alice can force Bob to make on his route from node $1$ to node $N$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 1 3 1 2 2 3 Sample Output: 0
