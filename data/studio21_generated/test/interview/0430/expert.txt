 You are given n apples. You need to divide them between 2 friends in such a way that the total weight of the apples given to Touma Kazusa is equal to the total weight of the apples given to Ogiso Setsuna. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of apples. The second line contains n integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n} (w_{i} = 100 or w_{i} = 200), where w_{i} is the weight of the i-th apple. -----Output----- In a single line print "YES" (without the quotes) if it is possible to divide all the apples between his friends. Otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 3 100 200 100 Output YES Input 4 100 100 100 200 Output NO -----Note----- In the first test sample Kitahara Haruki can give the first and the last apple to Ogiso Setsuna and the middle apple to Touma Kazusa.
