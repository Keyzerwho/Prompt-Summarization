 You are given two strings. Encode them using a secret code. Decode them using a secret code. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of words in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per line. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all words doesn't exceed 10^5.  The last line contains non-empty text message that Inna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed 10^5. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs more and less. -----Output----- In a single line, print "yes" (without the quotes), if Dima decoded the text message correctly, and "no" (without the quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 i love you <3i<3love<23you<3 Output yes Input 7 i am not main in the family <3i<>3am<3the<3<main<3in<3the<3><3family<3 Output no -----Note----- Please note that Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the statement.
