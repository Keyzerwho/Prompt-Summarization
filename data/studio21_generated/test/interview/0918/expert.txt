 The input given are results of qualifying competition. You need to identify the team from each region, or to announce that in this region its formation requires additional contests. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10 000, n ≥ 2m) — the number of participants of the qualifying contest and the number of regions in Berland. Next n lines contain the description of the participants of the qualifying contest in the following format: Surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and consisting of large and small English letters), region number (integer from 1 to m) and the number of points scored by the participant (integer from 0 to 800, inclusive). It is guaranteed that all surnames of all the participants are distinct and at least two people participated from each of the m regions. The surnames that only differ in letter cases, should be considered distinct. -----Output----- Print m lines. On the i-th line print the team of the i-th region — the surnames of the two team members in an arbitrary order, or a single character "?" (without the quotes) if you need to spend further qualifying contests in the region. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 Ivanov 1 763 Andreev 2 800 Petrov 1 595 Sidorov 1 790 Semenov 2 503 Output Sidorov Ivanov Andreev Semenov Input 5 2 Ivanov 1 800 Andreev 2 763 Petrov 1 800 Sidorov 1 800 Semenov 2 503 Output ? Andreev Semenov -----Note----- In the first sample region teams are uniquely determined. In the second sample the team from region 2 is uniquely determined and the team from region 1 can have three teams: "Petrov"-"Sidorov", "Ivanov"-"Sidorov", "Ivanov" -"Petrov", so it is impossible to determine a team uniquely.
