 You are given a sequence of 2^n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2^n. You need to print the value of v = 4 for the given sequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 17, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The next line contains 2^{n} integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2^{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} < 2^30). Each of the next m lines contains queries. The i-th line contains integers p_{i}, b_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 2^{n}, 0 ≤ b_{i} < 2^30) — the i-th query. -----Output----- Print m integers — the i-th integer denotes value v for sequence a after the i-th query. -----Examples----- Input 2 4 1 6 3 5 1 4 3 4 1 2 1 2 Output 1 3 3 3 -----Note----- For more information on the bit operations, you can follow this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation
