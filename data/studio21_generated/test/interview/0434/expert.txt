 You are given an array a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}), which consists of positive integers and values   -1. Find the minimum number n of arithmetic progressions Polycarpus needs to get a. To get a, the progressions need to be written down one after the other. Values   -1 may correspond to an arbitrary positive integer and the values a_{i} > 0 must be equal to the corresponding elements of sought consecutive record of the progressions. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements in the sequence. The second line contains integer values a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} separated by a space (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9 or a_{i} =  - 1). -----Output----- Print the minimum number of arithmetic progressions that you need to write one after another to get sequence a. The positions marked as -1 in a can be represented by any positive integers. -----Examples----- Input 9 8 6 4 2 1 4 7 10 2 Output 3 Input 9 -1 6 -1 2 -1 4 7 -1 2 Output 3 Input 5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 Output 1 Input 7 -1 -1 4 5 1 2 3 Output 2
