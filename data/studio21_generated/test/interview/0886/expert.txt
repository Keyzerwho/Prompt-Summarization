 You are given two integers n and d, where n is today's exchange rate and d is the number of digits in today's exchange rate. You are guaranteed that today's exchange rate is an even number. Help Anton to determine the exchange rate of currency you all know for tomorrow! 
-----Input----- The first line contains an odd positive integer n — the exchange rate of currency you all know for today. The length of number n's representation is within range from 2 to 10^5, inclusive. The representation of n doesn't contain any leading zeroes. -----Output----- If the information about tomorrow's exchange rate is inconsistent, that is, there is no integer that meets the condition, print  - 1. Otherwise, print the exchange rate of currency you all know against the burle for tomorrow. This should be the maximum possible number of those that are even and that are obtained from today's exchange rate by swapping exactly two digits. Exchange rate representation should not contain leading zeroes. -----Examples----- Input 527 Output 572 Input 4573 Output 3574 Input 1357997531 Output -1
