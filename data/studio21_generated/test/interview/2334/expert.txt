 You are given Alice's problem statement.  Alice has $x$ satoshis (1 bitcoin = $10^8$ satoshi) and wants to send $f$ satoshis ($10^{-9}$) to Bob.  Give her the amount of satoshis she needs to pay to achieve this goal. 
-----Input----- First line contains number $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 200\,000$) representing total number of public addresses Alice has. Next line contains $N$ integer numbers $a_i$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) separated by a single space, representing how many satoshi Alice has in her public addresses. Last line contains two numbers $x$, $f$ ($1 \leq f < x \leq 10^9$) representing maximum number of satoshies Alice can have in one address, as well as fee in satoshies she is willing to pay per transaction.  -----Output----- Output one integer number representing total fee in satoshi Alice will need to pay to achieve her goal. -----Example----- Input 3 13 7 6 6 2 Output 4 -----Note----- Alice can make two transactions in a following way: 0. 13 7 6 (initial state) 1. 6 7 6 5 (create new address and transfer from first public address 5 satoshies) 2. 6 4 6 5 1 (create new address and transfer from second address 1 satoshi) Since cost per transaction is 2 satoshies, total fee is 4.
