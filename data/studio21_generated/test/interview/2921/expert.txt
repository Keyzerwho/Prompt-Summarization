 You are given a total of n coins to form staircase rows where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   The output should be the total number of such rows formed. n>=0 and has the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 
-----Input-----  - One line containing three numbers:  - $m$ ($0.00 \le m \le 10.00$), the amount of money they can spend to two decimal places;  - $u$ ($0.0 \le u \le 20.0$), the number of units they aim to drink to one decimal place;  - $d$ ($1 \le d \le 8$), the number of different drinks available.  - Another $d$ lines, each containing:  - up to $20$ lowercase latin letters (the name of the drink);  - an integer between $0$ and $100$ (its strength as a percentage);  - its size (either ‘$1/1$’ for a litre, ‘$1/2$’ for a half or ‘$1/3$’ for a third);  - a real number to two decimal places; its cost. Name, strength, price and cost will be separated by spaces. -----Output----- If the students’ aims are possible, write one or more lines, each listing the name of the drink purchased followed by the positive integer count of how many drinks of that type were bought. If there are several solutions, output any. Otherwise, output a single line containing the word IMPOSSIBLE. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10.00 9.0 2 fire 2 1/1 4.00 water 10 1/2 2.00 Sample Output: fire 2 water 1
