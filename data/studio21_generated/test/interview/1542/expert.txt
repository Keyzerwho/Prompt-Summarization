 You are given a list of n integers $x_{i} \in \{1,...,q\}$. For each of the days, you need to know the number of shops where Vasiliy can buy one bottle of "Beecola". 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of shops in the city that sell Vasiliy's favourite drink. The second line contains n integers x_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 100 000) — prices of the bottles of the drink in the i-th shop. The third line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100 000) — the number of days Vasiliy plans to buy the drink. Then follow q lines each containing one integer m_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins Vasiliy can spent on the i-th day. -----Output----- Print q integers. The i-th of them should be equal to the number of shops where Vasiliy will be able to buy a bottle of the drink on the i-th day. -----Example----- Input 5 3 10 8 6 11 4 1 10 3 11 Output 0 4 1 5 -----Note----- On the first day, Vasiliy won't be able to buy a drink in any of the shops. On the second day, Vasiliy can buy a drink in the shops 1, 2, 3 and 4. On the third day, Vasiliy can buy a drink only in the shop number 1. Finally, on the last day Vasiliy can buy a drink in any shop.
