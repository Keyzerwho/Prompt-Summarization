 you are given a list of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of jars with colors Vika has. The second line of the input contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), where a_{i} is equal to the number of liters of paint in the i-th jar, i.e. the number of liters of color i that Vika has. -----Output----- The only line of the output should contain a single integer — the maximum number of squares that Vika can paint if she follows the rules described above. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 4 2 3 3 Output 12 Input 3 5 5 5 Output 15 Input 6 10 10 10 1 10 10 Output 11 -----Note----- In the first sample the best strategy is to start painting using color 4. Then the squares will be painted in the following colors (from left to right): 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In the second sample Vika can start to paint using any color. In the third sample Vika should start painting using color number 5.
