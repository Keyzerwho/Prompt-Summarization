 You are given n Ricks and n Mortys, n parallel universes and m groups. You need to find if world will end. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^4) — number of universes and number of groups respectively. The next m lines contain the information about the groups. i-th of them first contains an integer k (number of times someone joined i-th group, k > 0) followed by k integers v_{i}, 1, v_{i}, 2, ..., v_{i}, k. If v_{i}, j is negative, it means that Rick from universe number  - v_{i}, j has joined this group and otherwise it means that Morty from universe number v_{i}, j has joined it. Sum of k for all groups does not exceed 10^4. -----Output----- In a single line print the answer to Summer's question. Print "YES" if she should cancel the event and "NO" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 1 -3 4 -2 3 2 -3 Output YES Input 5 2 5 3 -2 1 -1 5 3 -5 2 5 Output NO Input 7 2 3 -1 6 7 7 -5 4 2 4 7 -3 4 Output YES -----Note----- In the first sample testcase, 1st group only contains the Rick from universe number 3, so in case he's a traitor, then all members of this group are traitors and so Summer should cancel the event.
