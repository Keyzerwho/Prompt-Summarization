 Given a string decode it. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the length of the encoded word. The second line contains the string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters — the encoding. -----Output----- Print the word that Polycarp encoded. -----Examples----- Input 5 logva Output volga Input 2 no Output no Input 4 abba Output baba -----Note----- In the first example Polycarp encoded the word volga. At first, he wrote down the letter l from the position 3, after that his word looked like voga. After that Polycarp wrote down the letter o from the position 2, his word became vga. Then Polycarp wrote down the letter g which was at the second position, the word became va. Then he wrote down the letter v, then the letter a. Thus, the encoding looked like logva. In the second example Polycarp encoded the word no. He wrote down the letter n, the word became o, and he wrote down the letter o. Thus, in this example, the word and its encoding are the same. In the third example Polycarp encoded the word baba. At first, he wrote down the letter a, which was at the position 2, after that the word looked like bba. Then he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 2, his word looked like ba. After that he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 1, the word looked like a, and he wrote down that letter a. Thus, the encoding is abba.
