 You are given information about windows of a building. You need to find the number of flats where according to Vitaly people aren't sleeping. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of floors in the house and the number of flats on each floor respectively. Next n lines describe the floors from top to bottom and contain 2·m characters each. If the i-th window of the given floor has lights on, then the i-th character of this line is '1', otherwise it is '0'. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of flats that have lights on in at least one window, that is, the flats where, according to Vitaly, people aren't sleeping. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Output 3 Input 1 3 1 1 0 1 0 0 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first test case the house has two floors, two flats on each floor. That is, in total there are 4 flats. The light isn't on only on the second floor in the left flat. That is, in both rooms of the flat the light is off. In the second test case the house has one floor and the first floor has three flats. The light is on in the leftmost flat (in both windows) and in the middle flat (in one window). In the right flat the light is off.
