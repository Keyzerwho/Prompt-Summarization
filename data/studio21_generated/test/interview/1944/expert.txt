 You are given descriptions of n laptops. Determine whether two described above laptops exist. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of laptops. Next n lines contain two integers each, a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n), where a_{i} is the price of the i-th laptop, and b_{i} is the number that represents the quality of the i-th laptop (the larger the number is, the higher is the quality). All a_{i} are distinct. All b_{i} are distinct.  -----Output----- If Alex is correct, print "Happy Alex", otherwise print "Poor Alex" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 2 1 Output Happy Alex
