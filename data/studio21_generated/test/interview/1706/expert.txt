 You are given a string $s$ of length $n$. You can perform at most $30$ operations on it. Perform operations such that the resulting string is a palindrome.  
-----Input----- The only line contains the string $S$ ($3 \le |s| \le 10^5$) of lowercase letters from the English alphabet. -----Output----- The first line should contain $k$ ($0\le k \le 30$)  — the number of operations performed. Each of the following $k$ lines should describe an operation in form L i or R i. $L$ represents the first operation, $R$ represents the second operation, $i$ represents the index chosen. The length of the resulting palindrome must not exceed $10^6$. -----Examples----- Input abac Output 2 R 2 R 5 Input acccc Output 2 L 4 L 2 Input hannah Output 0 -----Note----- For the first example the following operations are performed: abac $\to$ abacab $\to$ abacaba The second sample performs the following operations: acccc $\to$ cccacccc $\to$ ccccacccc The third example is already a palindrome so no operations are required.
