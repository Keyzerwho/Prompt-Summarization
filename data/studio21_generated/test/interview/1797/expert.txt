 You are given a positive integer n. You are also given two arrays of integers. The first array contains the numbers 1 to n. The second array contains the numbers 0 to n - 1. Your task is to find the maximum possible number of ordered pairs (x, y) such that you can start at station x and, after taking some subway trains (possibly zero), arrive at station y (1   x, y   n). 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) — the number of stations. The second line contains n integer numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the current structure of the subway. All these numbers are distinct. -----Output----- Print one number — the maximum possible value of convenience. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 3 Output 9 Input 5 1 5 4 3 2 Output 17 -----Note----- In the first example the mayor can change p_2 to 3 and p_3 to 1, so there will be 9 pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3). In the second example the mayor can change p_2 to 4 and p_3 to 5.
