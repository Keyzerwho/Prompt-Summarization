 You are given two words of the same length. You need to count how many words can be formed by deleting exactly one letter. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of words S and T. The second line contains word S. The third line contains word T. Words S and T consist of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that S and T are distinct words. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of distinct words W that can be transformed to S and T due to a typo. -----Examples----- Input 7 reading trading Output 1 Input 5 sweet sheep Output 0 Input 3 toy try Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample test the two given words could be obtained only from word "treading" (the deleted letters are marked in bold).
