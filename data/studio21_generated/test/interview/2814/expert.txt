 You are given two permutations $\sigma _0$, $\sigma _1$ of $[0,\ldots , 2N-1]$. You need to return the player that won (Anthony or Matthew).   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer $1\leq N\leq 10^6$. The second line contains $2N$ integers, with the $i$-th integer being $\sigma _0(i)$. This line defines $\sigma _0$. The third line contains $2N$ integers, with the $i$-th integer being $\sigma _1(i)$. This line defines $\sigma _1$. -----Output----- Output a single line with $0$ if Anthony wins, $1$ if Matthew wins, or $-1$ if the game ties. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 0 1 2 3  0 1 2 3  Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 2 0 2 1 3  0 2 1 3  Sample Output 2: 1
