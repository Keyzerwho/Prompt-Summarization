 You are given a string $s$ of even length $n$. You should color each bracket of $s$ into one of two colors: red or blue. Bracket sequence $r$, consisting only of red brackets, should be RBS, and bracket sequence, consisting only of blue brackets $b$, should be RBS. Any of them can be empty. You are not allowed to reorder characters in $s$, $r$ or $b$. No brackets can be left uncolored. Among all possible variants you should choose one that minimizes maximum of $r$'s and $b$'s nesting depth. If there are multiple solutions you can print any of them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an even integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) â€” the length of RBS $s$. The second line contains regular bracket sequence $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{$"(", ")"$\}$). -----Output----- Print single string $t$ of length $n$ consisting of "0"-s and "1"-s. If $t_i$ is equal to 0 then character $s_i$ belongs to RBS $r$, otherwise $s_i$ belongs to $b$. -----Examples----- Input 2 () Output 11 Input 4 (()) Output 0101 Input 10 ((()())()) Output 0110001111 -----Note----- In the first example one of optimal solutions is $s = $ "$\color{blue}{()}$". $r$ is empty and $b = $ "$()$". The answer is $\max(0, 1) = 1$. In the second example it's optimal to make $s = $ "$\color{red}{(}\color{blue}{(}\color{red}{)}\color{blue}{)}$". $r = b = $ "$()$" and the answer is $1$. In the third example we can make $s = $ "$\color{red}{(}\color{blue}{((}\color{red}{)()}\color{blue}{)())}$". $r = $ "$()()$" and $b = $ "$(()())$" and the answer is $2$.
