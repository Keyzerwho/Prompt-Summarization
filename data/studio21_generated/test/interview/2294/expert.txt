 You need to implement a multiset for integers, where you can add and remove integers from it and compute the number of integers in it. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of Artem's queries. Then follow n lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains three integers a_{i}, t_{i} and x_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 3, 1 ≤ t_{i}, x_{i} ≤ 10^9) — type of the query, moment of time Artem travels to in order to execute this query and the value of the query itself, respectively. It's guaranteed that all moments of time are distinct and that after each operation is applied all operations of the first and second types are consistent. -----Output----- For each ask operation output the number of instances of integer being queried at the given moment of time. -----Examples----- Input 6 1 1 5 3 5 5 1 2 5 3 6 5 2 3 5 3 7 5 Output 1 2 1 Input 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 Output 0
