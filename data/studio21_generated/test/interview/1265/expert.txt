 Given two Bitlandish strings check if it is possible to transform string a to string b in several (possibly zero) described operations. 
-----Input----- The first line contains Bitlandish string a, the second line contains Bitlandish string b. The strings can have different lengths. It is guaranteed that the given strings only consist of characters "0" and "1". The strings are not empty, their length doesn't exceed 10^6. -----Output----- Print "YES" if a can be transformed into b, otherwise print "NO". Please do not print the quotes. -----Examples----- Input 11 10 Output YES Input 1 01 Output NO Input 000 101 Output NO
