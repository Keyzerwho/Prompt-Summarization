 You are given a fence consisting of vertical boards.  You are given a fence consisting of vertical boards. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of boards in Vasily's fence. The second line contains n space-separated numbers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 10^9), where h_{i} equals the height of the i-th board to the left. -----Output----- Print the remainder after dividing r by 1 000 000 007, where r is the number of ways to cut exactly one connected part so that the part consisted of the upper parts of the boards and the remaining fence was good. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 1 Output 0 Input 3 3 4 2 Output 13 -----Note----- From the fence from the first example it is impossible to cut exactly one piece so as the remaining fence was good. All the possible variants of the resulting fence from the second sample look as follows (the grey shows the cut out part):  [Image]
