 You are given a number n and a value $p$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $p$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $p=7$, numbers divisible by $p$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- A single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the permutation size. -----Output----- If a perfect permutation of size n doesn't exist, print a single integer -1. Otherwise print n distinct integers from 1 to n, p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} — permutation p, that is perfect. Separate printed numbers by whitespaces. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output -1 Input 2 Output 2 1  Input 4 Output 2 1 4 3
