 You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem. 
-----Input----- Input describes the locations of shady spots on campus as well as the student’s dormitory and class locations. Input begins with a line containing an integer $0 \leq n \leq 2500$, the number of shady spots. Each of the next $n$ lines contains a pair of integers $x~ y$ specifying the coordinates of a shady spot. No two shady spots have the same coordinates. Following the shady spots are two more lines in the same format which specify the coordinates of the student’s dormitory and class, respectively. -----Output----- Print a path the student can take to get from her dormitory to class. The path should minimize the total sweat produced along the whole path. Print the path as indexes of the shady spots (from the order given in the input, with the first shady spot having index 0). If the best path contains no shady spots, output a single ‘-’. If there are multiple paths that minimize the total sweat, print any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 1 2 -2 5 -1 0 0 9 0 Sample Output 1: 1 2 Sample Input 2: 6 8 2 4 0 8 0 4 -1 7 -1 6 -2 2 1 9 2 Sample Output 2: 1 3 5 4 2
