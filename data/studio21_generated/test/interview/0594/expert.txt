 You are given n correct solutions and m wrong solutions. For each correct solution, you know its running time. For each wrong solution, you know its running time. You need to find the minimum time, for which all correct solutions pass the system testing, at least one correct solution passes the system testing with some "extra" time and all wrong solutions do not pass the system testing. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the running time of each of the n correct solutions in seconds. The third line contains m space-separated positive integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 100) — the running time of each of m wrong solutions in seconds.  -----Output----- If there is a valid TL value, print it. Otherwise, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 3 6 4 5 2 8 9 6 10 7 11 Output 5 Input 3 1 3 4 5 6 Output -1
