 You are given an array with some bits. there three possible combinations of bits 10, 11, 0. convert array to string and find if the last charecter should be a one bit charecter or not
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integers a_1, b_1 (1 ≤ a_1, b_1 ≤ 10^9) — the initial sizes of the first chocolate bar. The second line of the input contains integers a_2, b_2 (1 ≤ a_2, b_2 ≤ 10^9) — the initial sizes of the second bar. You can use the data of type int64 (in Pascal), long long (in С++), long (in Java) to process large integers (exceeding 2^31 - 1). -----Output----- In the first line print m — the sought minimum number of minutes. In the second and third line print the possible sizes of the bars after they are leveled in m minutes. Print the sizes using the format identical to the input format. Print the sizes (the numbers in the printed pairs) in any order. The second line must correspond to the first bar and the third line must correspond to the second bar. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution, print a single line with integer -1. -----Examples----- Input 2 6 2 3 Output 1 1 6 2 3 Input 36 5 10 16 Output 3 16 5 5 16 Input 3 5 2 1 Output -1
