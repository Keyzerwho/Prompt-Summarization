 You are given a formation of $10$ nodes. You need to find whether it is possible to organize the team to get a perfect team. 
-----Input----- The input will contain a single test case. The first line of the input will have one integer $c$ ($0 \leq c \leq 45$). $c$ represents the number of edges in the formation. The next $c$ lines represent the connections between nodes represented as two integers $a$ ($0 \leq a < 10$) and $b$ ($0 \leq b < 10$), where $a$ is not equal to $b$. Then, the next $10$ lines will be the players on Johnnyâ€™s team. Each line will contain four strings in the following order: player name, nation, league, team, which are delimited by a single space. These strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and consist of up to $15$ alphanumeric characters, which includes lower- and uppercase English letters, digits, and hyphens. -----Output----- If a perfect team can be organized by Johnny, print yes. Otherwise, print no. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 15 0 1 1 2 2 3 0 4 1 5 2 6 3 7 4 5 5 6 6 7 4 8 5 8 6 9 7 9 8 9 Griezmann France LaLiga AtleticoMadrid Benzema France LaLiga RealMadrid Ntep France Ligue1 StadeRennais Sissoko France PremierLeague Spurs Tolisso France Ligue1 Lyon Diarra France Ligue1 OM Evra France CalcioA Juventus Koscielny France PremierLeague Arsenal Varane France LaLiga RealMadrid Sagna France PremierLeague ManCity Sample Output: yes
