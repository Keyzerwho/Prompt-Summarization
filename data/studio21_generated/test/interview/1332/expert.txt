 You are given a list of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing five integers c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 and c_5 — the number of coins that the first, second, third, fourth and fifth players respectively have at the end of the game (0 ≤ c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5 ≤ 100). -----Output----- Print the only line containing a single positive integer b — the number of coins in the initial bet of each player. If there is no such value of b, then print the only value "-1" (quotes for clarity). -----Examples----- Input 2 5 4 0 4 Output 3 Input 4 5 9 2 1 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample the following sequence of operations is possible:  One coin is passed from the fourth player to the second player;  One coin is passed from the fourth player to the fifth player;  One coin is passed from the first player to the third player;  One coin is passed from the fourth player to the second player.
