 You have a string. You want to insert k lowercase letters into this string in order to get the largest possible value of the resulting string. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^3). The second line contains a single integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^3). The third line contains twenty-six integers from w_{a} to w_{z}. Each such number is non-negative and doesn't exceed 1000. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the largest possible value of the resulting string DZY could get. -----Examples----- Input abc 3 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 41 -----Note----- In the test sample DZY can obtain "abcbbc", value = 1·1 + 2·2 + 3·2 + 4·2 + 5·2 + 6·2 = 41.
