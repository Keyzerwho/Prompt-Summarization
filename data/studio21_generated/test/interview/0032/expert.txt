 You are given a list of n integers. You are asked to check if Limak s journey is valid. If Limak s journey is valid, then print "YES" on a single line. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got. -----Output----- Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes. -----Examples----- Input 5 7500 South 10000 East 3500 North 4444 West 4000 North Output YES Input 2 15000 South 4000 East Output NO Input 5 20000 South 1000 North 1000000 West 9000 North 10000 North Output YES Input 3 20000 South 10 East 20000 North Output NO Input 2 1000 North 1000 South Output NO Input 4 50 South 50 North 15000 South 15000 North Output YES -----Note----- Drawings below show how Limak's journey would look like in first two samples. In the second sample the answer is "NO" because he doesn't end on the North Pole. [Image]
