 =====Problem Statement===== You are given three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$. If $x+y+z$ is greater than 5, print "+"; otherwise, print "-". 
-----Input----- The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown. -----Output----- If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0". Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain. -----Examples----- Input 3 7 0 Output - Input 2 0 1 Output + Input 1 1 0 Output 0 Input 0 0 1 Output ? -----Note----- In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-". In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+". In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0". In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
