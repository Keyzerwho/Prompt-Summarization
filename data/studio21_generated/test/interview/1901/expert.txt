 You are given a list of characters (1-32). You need to find minimum number of characters needed to finish the quest. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of characters in Overcity and the number of pairs of friends. The second line contains n integer numbers c_{i} (0 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the amount of gold i-th character asks to start spreading the rumor. Then m lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (x_{i}, y_{i}) which represent that characters x_{i} and y_{i} are friends (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ n, x_{i} ≠ y_{i}). It is guaranteed that each pair is listed at most once. -----Output----- Print one number — the minimum amount of gold Vova has to spend in order to finish the quest. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 2 5 3 4 8 1 4 4 5 Output 10 Input 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Output 55 Input 10 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4 9 5 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Output 15 -----Note----- In the first example the best decision is to bribe the first character (he will spread the rumor to fourth character, and the fourth one will spread it to fifth). Also Vova has to bribe the second and the third characters, so they know the rumor. In the second example Vova has to bribe everyone. In the third example the optimal decision is to bribe the first, the third, the fifth, the seventh and the ninth characters.
