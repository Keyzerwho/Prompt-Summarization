 
-----Input----- The single line of input contains the integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^15) — the number of ways the thieves might steal the chocolates, as rumours say. -----Output----- Print the only integer n — the maximum amount of chocolates that thieves' bags can carry. If there are more than one n satisfying the rumors, print the smallest one. If there is no such n for a false-rumoured m, print  - 1. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 8 Input 8 Output 54 Input 10 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample case the smallest n that leads to exactly one way of stealing chocolates is n = 8, whereas the amounts of stealed chocolates are (1, 2, 4, 8) (the number of chocolates stolen by each of the thieves). In the second sample case the smallest n that leads to exactly 8 ways is n = 54 with the possibilities: (1, 2, 4, 8),  (1, 3, 9, 27),  (2, 4, 8, 16),  (2, 6, 18, 54),  (3, 6, 12, 24),  (4, 8, 16, 32),  (5, 10, 20, 40),  (6, 12, 24, 48). There is no n leading to exactly 10 ways of stealing chocolates in the third sample case.
