 You are given a list of integers $s$. Each integer represents one second of CPU time. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing four integers $Q$ ($2 \leq Q \leq 1000$), which is the time needed to complete the longer batches, $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq 1000000$), which is the number of machines owned by your company, $S$ ($0 \leq S \leq 1000000$), which is the number of 1-second time slots purchased, and $L$ ($0 \leq L \leq 1000000$), which is the number of $Q$-second time slots purchased. -----Output----- Display the smallest amount of time in which you can complete all of the purchased time slots. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 4 3 6 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 3 4 3 5 Sample Output 2: 6
