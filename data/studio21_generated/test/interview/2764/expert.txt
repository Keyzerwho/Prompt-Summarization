 You are given a board with coordinates (0, 0) to (8, 8). Your task is to write a program which moves a turtle from (0, 0) to (8, 8). 
-----Input----- The input consists of $9$ lines. The first $8$ lines contains the board, each line representing the squares in a row of the board. The turtle will always be at the bottom-left. There will be exactly $1$ diamond. The $9^{\text {th}}$ line contains the program the turtle master is asked to execute, which contains at least $1$ and at most $60$ instructions. -----Output----- Output Diamond! if the entire program can be executed without program error and if the turtle is on the diamond square after the program has been executed. Output Bug! if a program error occurred, or if the turtle does not end up on the diamond square! -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: ........ ........ ........ ...CC... ..C.DC.. .C..C... C.IC.... T.C..... FLFRXFLFRFLFRF Sample Output 1: Diamond! Sample Input 2: ........ ........ ........ ...CC... ..C.DC.. .C..C... C.IC.... T.C..... FLFRFLFRFLFRF Sample Output 2: Bug!
