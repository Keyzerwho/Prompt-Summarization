 # Task  Given a list of letters, Alexey can move to single letter viewing mode, move to the next or to the previous letter in the list. # 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of letters in the mailbox. The second line contains n space-separated integers (zeros and ones) — the state of the letter list. The i-th number equals either 1, if the i-th number is unread, or 0, if the i-th letter is read. -----Output----- Print a single number — the minimum number of operations needed to make all the letters read. -----Examples----- Input 5 0 1 0 1 0 Output 3 Input 5 1 1 0 0 1 Output 4 Input 2 0 0 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample Alexey needs three operations to cope with the task: open the second letter, move to the third one, move to the fourth one. In the second sample the action plan: open the first letter, move to the second letter, return to the list, open the fifth letter. In the third sample all letters are already read.
