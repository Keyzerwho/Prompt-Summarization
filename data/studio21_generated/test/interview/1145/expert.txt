 You are given an array of numbers. For each pair of numbers, find out, which of them has a strictly higher coolness factor. 
-----Input----- First line of input consists of one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000). Next line consists of n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n), which stand for coolness factor of each badge. -----Output----- Output single integer — minimum amount of coins the colonel has to pay. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 3 1 4 Output 1 Input 5 1 2 3 2 5 Output 2 -----Note----- In first sample test we can increase factor of first badge by 1. In second sample test we can increase factors of the second and the third badge by 1.
