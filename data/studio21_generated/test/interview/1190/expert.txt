 Given two integers $w_1$ and $h_1$, return two integers $w_2$ and $h_2$ such that $w_1 \ge w_2$ and $h_1 \ge h_2$. 
-----Input----- Four lines contain integers $w_1, h_1, w_2$ and $h_2$ ($1 \leq w_1, h_1, w_2, h_2 \leq 10^8$, $w_1 \ge w_2$) — the width of the first rectangle, the height of the first rectangle, the width of the second rectangle and the height of the second rectangle. You can't rotate the rectangles. -----Output----- Print exactly one integer — the number of cells, which should be marked after the ship is destroyed. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 1 Output 12 Input 2 2 1 2 Output 16 -----Note----- In the first example the field looks as follows (the first rectangle is red, the second rectangle is blue, green shows the marked squares): [Image]  In the second example the field looks as: [Image]
