 You are given cards for each player. Write a program that determines whether a player can win the game at the most favorable for him scenario or not.  
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of the players. Then follow n lines, each line describes a player's card. The line that describes a card starts from integer m_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i} ≤ 100) that shows how many numbers the i-th player's card has. Then follows a sequence of integers a_{i}, 1, a_{i}, 2, ..., a_{i}, m_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, k ≤ 100) — the numbers on the i-th player's card. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. It is guaranteed that all the numbers on each card are distinct. -----Output----- Print n lines, the i-th line must contain word "YES" (without the quotes), if the i-th player can win, and "NO" (without the quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 3 2 4 1 2 10 11 Output YES NO YES Input 2 1 1 1 1 Output NO NO
