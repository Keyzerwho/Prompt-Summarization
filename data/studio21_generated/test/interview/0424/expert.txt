 You are given a number X_0. You need to find the smallest possible number X_1 such that X_1 divides X_0. 
-----Input----- The input contains a single integer X_2 (4 ≤ X_2 ≤ 10^6). It is guaranteed that the integer X_2 is composite, that is, is not prime. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the minimum possible X_0. -----Examples----- Input 14 Output 6 Input 20 Output 15 Input 8192 Output 8191 -----Note----- In the first test, the smallest possible starting number is X_0 = 6. One possible course of the game is as follows:   Alice picks prime 5 and announces X_1 = 10  Bob picks prime 7 and announces X_2 = 14.  In the second case, let X_0 = 15.   Alice picks prime 2 and announces X_1 = 16  Bob picks prime 5 and announces X_2 = 20.
