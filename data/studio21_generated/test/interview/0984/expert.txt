 Given tree, you need to count how many times the search will  fail being run on every value from the tree. If the tree has multiple vertices with the same values on them then you should run algorithm on every one of them separately. 
-----Input----- First line contains integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — number of vertices in the tree. Each of the next n lines contains 3 numbers v, l, r (0 ≤ v ≤ 10^9) — value on current vertex, index of the left child of the vertex and index of the right child of the vertex, respectively. If some child doesn't exist then number  - 1 is set instead. Note that different vertices of the tree may contain the same values. -----Output----- Print number of times when search algorithm will fail. -----Examples----- Input 3 15 -1 -1 10 1 3 5 -1 -1 Output 2 Input 8 6 2 3 3 4 5 12 6 7 1 -1 8 4 -1 -1 5 -1 -1 14 -1 -1 2 -1 -1 Output 1 -----Note----- In the example the root of the tree in vertex 2. Search of numbers 5 and 15 will return fail because on the first step algorithm will choose the subtree which doesn't contain numbers you are looking for.
