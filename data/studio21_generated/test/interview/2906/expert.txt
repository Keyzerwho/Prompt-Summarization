 You are given a description of a paintball game. In the game, each player has a target. Your task is to find a target for each player such that everyone will be hit.   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space separated integers $N$ and $M$, satisfying $2\leq N\leq 1000$ and $0\leq M\leq 5000$, where $N$ is the number of players. Players are numbered $1, 2, \ldots , N$. $M$ lines follow, each line containing two space separated integers $A$ and $B$ ($1\leq A < B\leq N$), denoting that players $A$ and $B$ can see each other. Each pair of players appears at most once in the input. -----Output----- If there is no assignment of targets such that everyone will be hit, output Impossible. Otherwise output $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain the number of the target of the $i$-th player. If there is more than one solution, output any one. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 Sample Output: 2 3 1
