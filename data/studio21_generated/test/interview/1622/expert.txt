 You are given a list of employees. At every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the number of employees and the number of events.  Each of the next m lines contains the description of one event (the events are given in the chronological order). The first number of the line determines the type of event t (1 ≤ t ≤ 3).   If t = 1, then next follow two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ n) — numbers of the company employees. It is guaranteed that employee x doesn't have the boss currently.  If t = 2, then next follow integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) — the number of the employee who got a document packet.  If t = 3, then next follow two integers x and i (1 ≤ x ≤ n; 1 ≤ i ≤ [number of packets that have already been given]) — the employee and the number of the document packet for which you need to find out information. The document packets are numbered started from 1 in the chronological order.  It is guaranteed that the input has at least one query of the third type. -----Output----- For each query of the third type print "YES" if the employee signed the document package and "NO" otherwise. Print all the words without the quotes. -----Examples----- Input 4 9 1 4 3 2 4 3 3 1 1 2 3 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 Output YES NO YES
