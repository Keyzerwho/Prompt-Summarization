 You are given a list of strings, and you need to output a sorted list. Comparison should be case sensitive
-----Input----- In the first line of the input three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10) are given — the length of the string s, the length of the string t and Alyona's favourite number respectively. The second line of the input contains string s, consisting of lowercase English letters. The third line of the input contains string t, consisting of lowercase English letters. -----Output----- In the only line print the only non-negative integer — the sum of the lengths of the strings in a desired sequence. It is guaranteed, that at least one desired sequence exists. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 abc ab Output 2 Input 9 12 4 bbaaababb abbbabbaaaba Output 7 -----Note----- The following image describes the answer for the second sample case: [Image]
