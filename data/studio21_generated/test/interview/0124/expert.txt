 The Duck song 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($1 \le x, y, z \le 10^5$) — the number of grapes Andrew, Dmitry and Michal want to eat. The second line contains three integers $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10^5$) — the number of green, purple and black grapes in the box. -----Output----- If there is a grape distribution that allows everyone to be happy, print "YES", otherwise print "NO". -----Examples----- Input 1 6 2 4 3 3 Output YES Input 5 1 1 4 3 2 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example, there is only one possible distribution: Andrew should take $1$ green grape, Dmitry should take $3$ remaining green grapes and $3$ purple grapes, and Michal will take $2$ out of $3$ available black grapes. In the second test, there is no possible distribution, since Andrew is not be able to eat enough green grapes. :(
