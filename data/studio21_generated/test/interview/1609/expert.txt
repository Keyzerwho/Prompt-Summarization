 You have a set of items numbered from 1 to n. You want to make these numbers sequential, starting with 1. Changing a number is quite a time-consuming process, and you would like to make maximum use of the current numbering. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n — the number of items (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5) — the initial inventory numbers of the items. -----Output----- Print n numbers — the final inventory numbers of the items in the order they occur in the input. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 3 2 Output 1 3 2  Input 4 2 2 3 3 Output 2 1 3 4  Input 1 2 Output 1  -----Note----- In the first test the numeration is already a permutation, so there is no need to change anything. In the second test there are two pairs of equal numbers, in each pair you need to replace one number. In the third test you need to replace 2 by 1, as the numbering should start from one.
