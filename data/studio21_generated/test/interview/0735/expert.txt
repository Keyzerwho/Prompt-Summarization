 You are given an array a consisting of n distinct integers. You are required to find the smallest possible size of an array which satisfies the following conditions: a (in increasing order) by reversing exactly one segment of a 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the size of array a. The second line contains n distinct space-separated integers: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print "yes" or "no" (without quotes), depending on the answer. If your answer is "yes", then also print two space-separated integers denoting start and end (start must not be greater than end) indices of the segment to be reversed. If there are multiple ways of selecting these indices, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 2 1 Output yes 1 3 Input 4 2 1 3 4 Output yes 1 2 Input 4 3 1 2 4 Output no Input 2 1 2 Output yes 1 1 -----Note----- Sample 1. You can reverse the entire array to get [1, 2, 3], which is sorted. Sample 3. No segment can be reversed such that the array will be sorted. Definitions A segment [l, r] of array a is the sequence a[l], a[l + 1], ..., a[r]. If you have an array a of size n and you reverse its segment [l, r], the array will become: a[1], a[2], ..., a[l - 2], a[l - 1], a[r], a[r - 1], ..., a[l + 1], a[l], a[r + 1], a[r + 2], ..., a[n - 1], a[n].
