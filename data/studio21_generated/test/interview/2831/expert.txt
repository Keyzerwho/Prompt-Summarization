  Given knowledge of the current location and velocity of all the vehicles, what is the closest that the vehicles will get to each other. 
-----Input----- There will be a single test case in the input. This test case will begin with a line with a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100000$) representing the number of vehicles. Each of the next $n$ lines will have two integers, $x$ and $v$ ($-100000 \le x,v \le 100000$), indicating the position ($x$, in meters) and velocity ($v$, in meters/hour) of that vehicle. The sign of velocity indicates direction. -----Output----- Output a single number equal to the minimum distance that will cover all of the vehicles at some time, in meters. Your result should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-3}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 -100 1 100 -1 Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 3 -100 1 100 -1 101 -1 Sample Output 2: 1
