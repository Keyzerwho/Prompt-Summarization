 you are given a string $s$ consisting of uppercase letters. Return the minimum number of operations that you need to apply, so that the genome appears in it as a substring. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 50$) — the length of the string $s$. The second line contains the string $s$, consisting of exactly $n$ uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet. -----Output----- Output the minimum number of operations that need to be applied to the string $s$ so that the genome appears as a substring in it. -----Examples----- Input 4 ZCTH Output 2 Input 5 ZDATG Output 5 Input 6 AFBAKC Output 16 -----Note----- In the first example, you should replace the letter "Z" with "A" for one operation, the letter "H" — with the letter "G" for one operation. You will get the string "ACTG", in which the genome is present as a substring. In the second example, we replace the letter "A" with "C" for two operations, the letter "D" — with the letter "A" for three operations. You will get the string "ZACTG", in which there is a genome.
