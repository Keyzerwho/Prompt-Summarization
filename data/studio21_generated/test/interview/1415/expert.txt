 You are given a string s consisting of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D', where each letter stands for a command. Your task is to predict in how many tests the robot will run exactly k commands before it blows up. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains four integers x, y, x_0, y_0 (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 500, 1 ≤ x_0 ≤ x, 1 ≤ y_0 ≤ y) — the sizes of the field and the starting coordinates of the robot. The coordinate axis X is directed downwards and axis Y is directed to the right. The second line contains a sequence of commands s, which should be fulfilled by the robot. It has length from 1 to 100 000 characters and only consists of characters 'L', 'R', 'U', 'D'. -----Output----- Print the sequence consisting of (length(s) + 1) numbers. On the k-th position, starting with zero, print the number of tests where the robot will run exactly k commands before it blows up. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 2 2 UURDRDRL Output 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 6 Input 2 2 2 2 ULD Output 1 1 1 1 -----Note----- In the first sample, if we exclude the probable impact of the mines, the robot's route will look like that: $(2,2) \rightarrow(1,2) \rightarrow(1,2) \rightarrow(1,3) \rightarrow(2,3) \rightarrow(2,4) \rightarrow(3,4) \rightarrow(3,4) \rightarrow(3,3)$.
