 Given two strings s and t, find how many substrings of t start and end with the same letter and the length of t is more than 1. 
-----Input----- The first line contains 26 integers x_{a}, x_{b}, ..., x_{z} ( - 10^5 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^5) — the value assigned to letters a, b, c, ..., z respectively. The second line contains string s of length between 1 and 10^5 characters, consisting of Lating lowercase letters— the string for which you need to calculate the answer.  -----Output----- Print the answer to the problem.  -----Examples----- Input 1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 xabcab Output 2 Input 1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 aaa Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample test strings satisfying the condition above are abca and bcab. In the second sample test strings satisfying the condition above are two occurences of aa.
