 You are given $n$ cards. Alice chooses a segment $[l; r]$. Bob removes a single card $j$ from that segment $(l \le j \le r)$. The score of the game is the total value of the remaining cards on the segment $(a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{j - 1} + a_{j + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r)$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of cards. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($-30 \le a_i \le 30$) — the values on the cards. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the final score of the game. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 -2 10 -1 4 Output 6 Input 8 5 2 5 3 -30 -30 6 9 Output 10 Input 3 -10 6 -15 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example Alice chooses a segment $[1;5]$ — the entire row of cards. Bob removes card $3$ with the value $10$ from the segment. Thus, the final score is $5 + (-2) + (-1) + 4 = 6$. In the second example Alice chooses a segment $[1;4]$, so that Bob removes either card $1$ or $3$ with the value $5$, making the answer $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$. In the third example Alice can choose any of the segments of length $1$: $[1;1]$, $[2;2]$ or $[3;3]$. Bob removes the only card, so the score is $0$. If Alice chooses some other segment then the answer will be less than $0$.
