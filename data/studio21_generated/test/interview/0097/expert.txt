 You are given a list of numbers. Each number has a positive integer number. Your task is to determine whether the ball will fall into a pocket eventually, and if yes, which of the four pockets it will be. 
-----Input----- The only line contains $6$ integers $n$, $m$, $x$, $y$, $v_x$, $v_y$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9$, $0 \leq x \leq n$; $0 \leq y \leq m$; $-1 \leq v_x, v_y \leq 1$; $(v_x, v_y) \neq (0, 0)$) — the width of the table, the length of the table, the $x$-coordinate of the initial position of the ball, the $y$-coordinate of the initial position of the ball, the $x$-component of its initial speed and the $y$-component of its initial speed, respectively. It is guaranteed that the ball is not initially in a pocket. -----Output----- Print the coordinates of the pocket the ball will fall into, or $-1$ if the ball will move indefinitely. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 2 2 -1 1 Output 0 0 Input 4 4 2 0 1 1 Output -1 Input 10 10 10 1 -1 0 Output -1 -----Note----- The first sample:  [Image]  The second sample:  [Image]  In the third sample the ball will never change its $y$ coordinate, so the ball will never fall into a pocket.
