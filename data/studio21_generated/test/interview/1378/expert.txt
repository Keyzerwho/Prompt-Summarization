 You are given n integers. Create a convex regular polygon with sides of length 1.  Bill gets to keep property inside of 2n-sided polygon B_0 B_1... B_2n - 1  Luckily, Bill found out which B_2k points the court chose. Even though he is a great mathematician, his house is very big and he has a hard time calculating. Therefore, he is asking you to help him choose points so he maximizes area of property he can keep. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000), representing number of edges of 2n-sided polygon. The second line contains n distinct integer numbers B_2k (0 ≤ B_2k ≤ n - 1,  k = 0... n - 1) separated by a single space, representing points the court chose. If B_2k = i, the court chose point P_{i} on side A_2k A_2k + 1. -----Output----- Output contains n distinct integers separated by a single space representing points B_1, B_3, ..., B_2n - 1 Bill should choose in order to maximize the property area. If there are multiple solutions that maximize the area, return any of them. -----Example----- Input 3 0 1 2 Output 0 2 1 -----Note----- To maximize area Bill should choose points: B_1 = P_0, B_3 = P_2, B_5 = P_1 [Image]
