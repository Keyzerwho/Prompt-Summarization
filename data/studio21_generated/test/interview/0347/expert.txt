 You are given three integers: Kevin's submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. You need to output Kevin's final score. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, where m_{i} (0 ≤ m_{i} ≤ 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted. The second line contains five space-separated integers w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, where w_{i} (0 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i. The last line contains two space-separated integers h_{s} and h_{u} (0 ≤ h_{s}, h_{u} ≤ 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively. -----Output----- Print a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score. -----Examples----- Input 20 40 60 80 100 0 1 2 3 4 1 0 Output 4900 Input 119 119 119 119 119 0 0 0 0 0 10 0 Output 4930 -----Note----- In the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets $(1 - \frac{119}{250}) = \frac{131}{250}$ of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is $\frac{131}{250}(500 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500) = 3930$. Adding in 10·100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.
