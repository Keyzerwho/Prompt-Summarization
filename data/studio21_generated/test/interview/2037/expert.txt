 You are given a sequence of problems' difficulties in the order Arkady created them. For each problem, determine whether Arkady held the round right after creating this problem, or not. Initially the problems pool is empty. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^5$) — the number of difficulty levels and the number of problems Arkady created. The second line contains $m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) — the problems' difficulties in the order Arkady created them. -----Output----- Print a line containing $m$ digits. The $i$-th digit should be $1$ if Arkady held the round after creation of the $i$-th problem, and $0$ otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 11 2 3 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 1 Output 00100000001 Input 4 8 4 1 3 3 2 3 3 3 Output 00001000 -----Note----- In the first example Arkady held the round after the first three problems, because they are of distinct difficulties, and then only after the last problem.
