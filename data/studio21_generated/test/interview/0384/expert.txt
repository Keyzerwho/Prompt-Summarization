 The input given is a single row consisting of n squares (e.g. japanese crossword sized 1   n).  You need to find the numbers encrypting the row.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the row. The second line of the input contains a single string consisting of n characters 'B' or 'W', ('B' corresponds to black square, 'W' — to white square in the row that Adaltik drew). -----Output----- The first line should contain a single integer k — the number of integers encrypting the row, e.g. the number of groups of black squares in the row. The second line should contain k integers, encrypting the row, e.g. corresponding to sizes of groups of consecutive black squares in the order from left to right. -----Examples----- Input 3 BBW Output 1 2  Input 5 BWBWB Output 3 1 1 1  Input 4 WWWW Output 0 Input 4 BBBB Output 1 4  Input 13 WBBBBWWBWBBBW Output 3 4 1 3  -----Note----- The last sample case correspond to the picture in the statement.
