 Given a list of cards, determine if the statement is true for all cards. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of input will contain a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 50), denoting the sides of the cards that you can see on the table currently. Each character of s is either a lowercase English letter or a digit. -----Output----- Print a single integer, the minimum number of cards you must turn over to verify your claim. -----Examples----- Input ee Output 2 Input z Output 0 Input 0ay1 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample, we must turn over both cards. Note that even though both cards have the same letter, they could possibly have different numbers on the other side. In the second sample, we don't need to turn over any cards. The statement is vacuously true, since you know your friend has no cards with a vowel on them. In the third sample, we need to flip the second and fourth cards.
