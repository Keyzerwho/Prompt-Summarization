 You are given $n$ sweets with sizes $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. All sweets have different sizes. You are given $n$ children. All children have different sums of sweets. Find the maximum number of children you can invite by giving each of them two sweets in such way that nobody will be upset.
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 1\,000$) — the number of sweets Mike has. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5$) — the sizes of the sweets. It is guaranteed that all integers are distinct. -----Output----- Print one integer — the maximum number of children Mike can invite giving each of them two sweets in such way that nobody will be upset. -----Examples----- Input 8 1 8 3 11 4 9 2 7 Output 3 Input 7 3 1 7 11 9 2 12 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example, Mike can give $9+2=11$ to one child, $8+3=11$ to another one, and $7+4=11$ to the third child. Therefore, Mike can invite three children. Note that it is not the only solution. In the second example, Mike can give $3+9=12$ to one child and $1+11$ to another one. Therefore, Mike can invite two children. Note that it is not the only solution.
