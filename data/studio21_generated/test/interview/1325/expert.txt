  Given a list of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and p (1 ≤ p ≤ n), the length of Nam's string and the initial position of the text cursor. The next line contains n lowercase characters of Nam's string. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of presses needed to change string into a palindrome. -----Examples----- Input 8 3 aeabcaez Output 6 -----Note----- A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward or reversed. In the sample test, initial Nam's string is: $\text{aeabcaez}$ (cursor position is shown bold). In optimal solution, Nam may do 6 following steps:[Image] The result, $\text{zeaccaez}$, is now a palindrome.
