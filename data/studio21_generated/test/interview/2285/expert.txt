 You have several short records of IPv6 addresses. Restore their full record. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n — the number of records to restore (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains a string — the short IPv6 addresses. Each string only consists of string characters "0123456789abcdef:". It is guaranteed that each short address is obtained by the way that is described in the statement from some full IPv6 address. -----Output----- For each short IPv6 address from the input print its full record on a separate line. Print the full records for the short IPv6 addresses in the order, in which the short records follow in the input. -----Examples----- Input 6 a56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00 a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:: a56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0 a56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0 :: 0ea::4d:f4:6:0 Output a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000 a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000 a56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0 a56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 00ea:0000:0000:0000:004d:00f4:0006:0000
