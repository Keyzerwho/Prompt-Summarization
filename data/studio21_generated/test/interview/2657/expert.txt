 You are given an array of integers. You need to select two numbers from the array such that, removing all subsequences in which (Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -  Minimum_element_of_subsequence    d) from the set of all subsequences will give you two subsequences. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: n a_1 a_2 ... a_n -----Output----- Print a_i and a_j that you selected, with a space in between. -----Sample Input----- 5 6 9 4 2 11 -----Sample Output----- 11 6 \rm{comb}(a_i,a_j) for each possible selection is as follows:  - \rm{comb}(4,2)=6   - \rm{comb}(6,2)=15   - \rm{comb}(6,4)=15   - \rm{comb}(9,2)=36   - \rm{comb}(9,4)=126   - \rm{comb}(9,6)=84   - \rm{comb}(11,2)=55   - \rm{comb}(11,4)=330   - \rm{comb}(11,6)=462   - \rm{comb}(11,9)=55 Thus, we should print 11 and 6.
