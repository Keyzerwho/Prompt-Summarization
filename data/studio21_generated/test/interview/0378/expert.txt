 You are given k burles and r burles. You need to output the minimum number of shovels that Polycarp needs to buy. 
-----Input----- The single line of input contains two integers k and r (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ r ≤ 9) — the price of one shovel and the denomination of the coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from "10-burle coins".  Remember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10, that is, Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels. -----Output----- Print the required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay for them without any change.  -----Examples----- Input 117 3 Output 9 Input 237 7 Output 1 Input 15 2 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first example Polycarp can buy 9 shovels and pay 9·117 = 1053 burles. Indeed, he can pay this sum by using 10-burle coins and one 3-burle coin. He can't buy fewer shovels without any change. In the second example it is enough for Polycarp to buy one shovel. In the third example Polycarp should buy two shovels and pay 2·15 = 30 burles. It is obvious that he can pay this sum without any change.
