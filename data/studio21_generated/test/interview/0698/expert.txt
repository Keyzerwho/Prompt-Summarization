 Help Sereja find two numbers: 
                           0               1               2               3               4               5               6               7               8               9               10              
                           0               1               2               3               4               5               6               7               8               9               10              
                           0               1               2               3               4               
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers: x (1 ≤ x ≤ 4000) — the round Sereja is taking part in today, and k (0 ≤ k < 4000) — the number of rounds he took part in. Next k lines contain the descriptions of the rounds that Sereja took part in before. If Sereja took part in one of two simultaneous rounds, the corresponding line looks like: "1 num_2 num_1" (where num_2 is the identifier of this Div2 round, num_1 is the identifier of the Div1 round). It is guaranteed that num_1 - num_2 = 1. If Sereja took part in a usual Div2 round, then the corresponding line looks like: "2 num" (where num is the identifier of this Div2 round). It is guaranteed that the identifiers of all given rounds are less than x. -----Output----- Print in a single line two integers — the minimum and the maximum number of rounds that Sereja could have missed. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 1 2 2 Output 0 0 Input 9 3 1 2 3 2 8 1 4 5 Output 2 3 Input 10 0 Output 5 9 -----Note----- In the second sample we have unused identifiers of rounds 1, 6, 7. The minimum number of rounds Sereja could have missed equals to 2. In this case, the round with the identifier 1 will be a usual Div2 round and the round with identifier 6 will be synchronous with the Div1 round.  The maximum number of rounds equals 3. In this case all unused identifiers belong to usual Div2 rounds.
