 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 
-----Input----- The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9; 0 ≤ m ≤ n). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the remainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9). -----Examples----- Input 5 3 2 Output 3 Input 5 4 2 Output 6 -----Note----- Sample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for each two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third and fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points. Sample 2. Now Manao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the only wrong answer is to the question 4. Also note that you are asked to minimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For example, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the answer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is a smaller number.
