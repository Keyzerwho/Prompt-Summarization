 Given an 2 dimentional array, find the amounts of cubes in each of the n columns after the gravity switch!
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of the columns in the box. The next line contains n space-separated integer numbers. The i-th number a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) denotes the number of cubes in the i-th column. -----Output----- Output n integer numbers separated by spaces, where the i-th number is the amount of cubes in the i-th column after the gravity switch. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 2 1 2 Output 1 2 2 3  Input 3 2 3 8 Output 2 3 8  -----Note----- The first example case is shown on the figure. The top cube of the first column falls to the top of the last column; the top cube of the second column falls to the top of the third column; the middle cube of the first column falls to the top of the second column. In the second example case the gravity switch does not change the heights of the columns.
