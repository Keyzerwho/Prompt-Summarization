 You are given a number $a$. In one step, you can multiply $a$ by $2$, or divide $a$ by $4$. Return the minimum number of steps required before $a$ equals $b$.   
-----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) — the number of test cases. The following $t$ lines contain a description of test cases. The first and only line in each test case contains integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a, b \leq 10^{18}$) — the initial and target value of the variable, respectively. -----Output----- Output $t$ lines, each line should contain one integer denoting the minimum number of operations Johnny needs to perform. If Johnny cannot get $b$ at the end, then write $-1$. -----Example----- Input 10 10 5 11 44 17 21 1 1 96 3 2 128 1001 1100611139403776 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 7 1 10 8 Output 1 1 -1 0 2 2 14 0 -1 -1 -----Note----- In the first test case, Johnny can reach $5$ from $10$ by using the shift to the right by one (i.e. divide by $2$). In the second test case, Johnny can reach $44$ from $11$ by using the shift to the left by two (i.e. multiply by $4$). In the third test case, it is impossible for Johnny to reach $21$ from $17$. In the fourth test case, initial and target values are equal, so Johnny has to do $0$ operations. In the fifth test case, Johnny can reach $3$ from $96$ by using two shifts to the right: one by $2$, and another by $3$ (i.e. divide by $4$ and by $8$).
