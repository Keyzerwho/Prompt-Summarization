 Given a sequence of moves, determine whether a Touchdown, Safety, or Nothing occurred on the given drive. 
-----Input----- The input starts of a line containing one integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 15$), which is the number of plays that this given drive recorded. Following this line are $N$ integers representing the numbers of yards gained or lost on each particular play. Each given number is between $-100$ and $100$ yards (exclusive range) since that is the length of the football field. -----Output----- Output a single word, the result of the drive! If a touchdown is achieved, output “Touchdown”, if a safety is achieved, output “Safety”, else output “Nothing”. (Do not add a period at the end.) Once the outcome has been determined, your program should ignore any remaining yards listed in the drive. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 9 10 3 8 22 -4 16 8 3 14 Sample Output: Touchdown
