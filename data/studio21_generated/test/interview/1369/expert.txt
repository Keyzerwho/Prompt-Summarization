 You are given two integers N and x_i and y_i. Find the minimum radius of the circle of center (x_i, y_i) such that all the points are inside or on it. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N x_1 y_1 : x_N y_N -----Output----- Print the minimum radius of a circle such that all the N points are inside or on it. Your output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}. -----Sample Input----- 2 0 0 1 0 -----Sample Output----- 0.500000000000000000 Both points are contained in the circle centered at (0.5,0) with a radius of 0.5.
