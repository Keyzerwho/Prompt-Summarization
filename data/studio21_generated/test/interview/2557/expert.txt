 You are given two cities a and b. You need to construct teleportation pipes so that for each important pair (a, b), it will be possible to travel from city a to city b by using one or more teleportation pipes (but not necessarily from city b to city a). 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), denoting the number of the cities in Shuseki Kingdom and the number of the important pairs, respectively. The following m lines describe the important pairs. The i-th of them (1 ≤ i ≤ m) contains two space-separated integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n, a_{i} ≠ b_{i}), denoting that it must be possible to travel from city a_{i} to city b_{i} by using one or more teleportation pipes (but not necessarily from city b_{i} to city a_{i}). It is guaranteed that all pairs (a_{i}, b_{i}) are distinct. -----Output----- Print the minimum required number of teleportation pipes to fulfill Mr. Kitayuta's purpose. -----Examples----- Input 4 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 2 4 Output 3 Input 4 6 1 2 1 4 2 3 2 4 3 2 3 4 Output 4 -----Note----- For the first sample, one of the optimal ways to construct pipes is shown in the image below:  [Image]  For the second sample, one of the optimal ways is shown below:  [Image]
