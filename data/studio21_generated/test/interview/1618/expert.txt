 You are given an array with numbers. You need to find the height of each box after landing. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of stairs in the staircase. The second line contains a non-decreasing sequence, consisting of n integers, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9; a_{i} ≤ a_{i} + 1). The next line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of boxes. Each of the following m lines contains a pair of integers w_{i}, h_{i} (1 ≤ w_{i} ≤ n; 1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the size of the i-th thrown box. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces. -----Output----- Print m integers — for each box the height, where the bottom of the box will be after landing. Print the answers for the boxes in the order, in which the boxes are given in the input. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 6 6 4 1 1 3 1 1 1 4 3 Output 1 3 4 6 Input 3 1 2 3 2 1 1 3 1 Output 1 3 Input 1 1 5 1 2 1 10 1 10 1 10 1 10 Output 1 3 13 23 33 -----Note----- The first sample are shown on the picture.
