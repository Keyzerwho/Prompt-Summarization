 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 57179$) — the number of test cases. Each of the following $t$ lines contains four natural numbers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$ ($1 \le x_1 \le x_2 \le 10^9$, $1 \le y_1 \le y_2 \le 10^9$) — coordinates of the start and the end cells.  -----Output----- For each test case, in a separate line, print the number of possible different sums on the way from the start cell to the end cell. -----Example----- Input 4 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 4 179 1 179 100000 5 7 5 7 Output 2 3 1 1 -----Note----- In the first test case there are two possible sums: $1+2+5=8$ and $1+3+5=9$.
