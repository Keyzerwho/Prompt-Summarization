 you are given n users and their ratings. Find the optimal distribution. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of users on the site. The next line contains integer sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print a sequence of integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. Number b_{i} means that user i gets b_{i} of rating as a present. The printed sequence must meet the problem conditions.  If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 1 1 Output 5 1 2 Input 1 1000000000 Output 1000000000
