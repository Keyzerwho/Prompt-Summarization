 Pavel is bored and falls asleep. When he wakes up, he finds out that the tournament is over and the teams want to know the results of all the matches. Help Pavel come up with chronology of results that meets all the conditions, otherwise report that there is no such table. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers — n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 1000). -----Output----- In the first line print an integer m — number of the played games. The following m lines should contain the information about all the matches, one match per line. The i-th line should contain two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n; a_{i} ≠ b_{i}). The numbers a_{i} and b_{i} mean, that in the i-th match the team with number a_{i} won against the team with number b_{i}. You can assume, that the teams are numbered from 1 to n. If a tournir that meets the conditions of the problem does not exist, then print -1. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 Output 3 1 2 2 3 3 1
