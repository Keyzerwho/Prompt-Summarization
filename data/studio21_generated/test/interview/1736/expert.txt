 You are given n books numbered from 1 to n. Valera needs t minutes to read each book. He chooses an arbitrary book with number i and reads books one by one, starting from this book. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^9) — the number of books and the number of free minutes Valera's got. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4), where number a_{i} shows the number of minutes that the boy needs to read the i-th book. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of books Valera can read. -----Examples----- Input 4 5 3 1 2 1 Output 3 Input 3 3 2 2 3 Output 1
