 You are given a number $n$. You are asked to determine the total number of possible bus number variants. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$) — the number of the bus that was seen by Vasya. It is guaranteed that this number does not start with $0$. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the amount of possible variants of the real bus number. -----Examples----- Input 97 Output 2 Input 2028 Output 13 -----Note----- In the first sample, only variants $97$ and $79$ are possible. In the second sample, the variants (in the increasing order) are the following: $208$, $280$, $802$, $820$, $2028$, $2082$, $2208$, $2280$, $2802$, $2820$, $8022$, $8202$, $8220$.
