 You are given a list of measurements. n>=0 and has the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of measurements Vasya made. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 5000) — the results of the measurements. The numbers on the second line are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of results Vasya will have to remove. -----Examples----- Input 6 4 5 3 8 3 7 Output 2 Input 4 4 3 2 4 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample you can remove the fourth and the sixth measurement results (values 8 and 7). Then the maximum of the remaining values will be 5, and the minimum one will be 3. Or else, you can remove the third and fifth results (both equal 3). After that the largest remaining result will be 8, and the smallest one will be 4.
