 You are given two numbers p and q, and you need to know the distance d, in meters, from Harry's position to the place where the second meeting of the two impulses will occur. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer l (1 ≤ l ≤ 1 000) — the length of the corridor where the fight takes place. The second line contains integer p, the third line contains integer q (1 ≤ p, q ≤ 500) — the speeds of magical impulses for Harry Potter and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, respectively. -----Output----- Print a single real number — the distance from the end of the corridor, where Harry is located, to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error will not exceed 10^{ - 4}.  Namely: let's assume that your answer equals a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Input 100 50 50 Output 50 Input 199 60 40 Output 119.4 -----Note----- In the first sample the speeds of the impulses are equal, so both of their meetings occur exactly in the middle of the corridor.
