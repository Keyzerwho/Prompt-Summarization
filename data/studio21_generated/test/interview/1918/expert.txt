 You are given an array of teams. Return the maximum strength that Bob can achieve. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·10^5) — the number of game pieces. The second line contains n integers p_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the strength of the i-th piece. The third line contains n characters A or B — the assignment of teams after the first step (after Alice's step). -----Output----- Print the only integer a — the maximum strength Bob can achieve. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 ABABA Output 11 Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 AAAAA Output 15 Input 1 1 B Output 1 -----Note----- In the first sample Bob should flip the suffix of length one. In the second sample Bob should flip the prefix or the suffix (here it is the same) of length 5. In the third sample Bob should do nothing.
