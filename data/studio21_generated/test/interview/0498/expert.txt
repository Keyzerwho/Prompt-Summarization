 You are given an array of integers. You need to determine at which lane and at which desk Santa Clause should sit. 
-----Input----- The only line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2nm) — the number of lanes, the number of desks in each lane and the number of Santa Claus' place. -----Output----- Print two integers: the number of lane r, the number of desk d, and a character s, which stands for the side of the desk Santa Claus. The character s should be "L", if Santa Clause should sit on the left, and "R" if his place is on the right. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 9 Output 2 2 L Input 4 3 24 Output 4 3 R Input 2 4 4 Output 1 2 R -----Note----- The first and the second samples are shown on the picture. The green place corresponds to Santa Claus' place in the first example, the blue place corresponds to Santa Claus' place in the second example. In the third sample there are two lanes with four desks in each, and Santa Claus has the fourth place. Thus, his place is in the first lane at the second desk on the right.
