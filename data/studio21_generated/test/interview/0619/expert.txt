 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Sasha has $5$ chizhiks, Masha has $4$ chizhiks, and the price for one coconut be $3$ chizhiks. If the girls don't exchange with chizhiks, they will buy $1 + 1 = 2$ coconuts. However, if, for example, Masha gives Sasha one chizhik, then Sasha will have $6$ chizhiks, Masha will have $3$ 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($0 \le x, y \le 10^{18}$, $1 \le z \le 10^{18}$) — the number of chizhics Sasha has, the number of chizhics Masha has and the price of a coconut.  -----Output----- Print two integers: the maximum possible number of coconuts the girls can buy and the minimum number of chizhiks one girl has to give to the other. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 3 Output 3 1 Input 6 8 2 Output 7 0 -----Note----- The first example is described in the statement. In the second example the optimal solution is to dot exchange any chizhiks. The girls will buy $3 + 4 = 7$ coconuts.
