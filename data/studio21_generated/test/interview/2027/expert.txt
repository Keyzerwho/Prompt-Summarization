 you are given an array of numbers. Find all numbers in the array which satisfy the given condition. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of integers written in the row. The next line contains n, the i'th of which is a_{i} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the value of the i'th number. -----Output----- Print n integers corresponding to the sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. It's guaranteed that the answer is unique and fits in 32-bit integer type. -----Examples----- Input 5 6 -4 8 -2 3 Output 2 4 6 1 3  Input 5 3 -2 -1 5 6 Output 1 -3 4 11 6  -----Note----- In the first sample test, the crows report the numbers 6, - 4, 8, - 2, and 3 when he starts at indices 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. It is easy to check that the sequence 2 4 6 1 3 satisfies the reports. For example, 6 = 2 - 4 + 6 - 1 + 3, and  - 4 = 4 - 6 + 1 - 3. In the second sample test, the sequence 1,  - 3, 4, 11, 6 satisfies the reports. For example, 5 = 11 - 6 and 6 = 6.
