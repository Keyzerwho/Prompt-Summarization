 Given an alphabet $A$, $n$ letters, $k$ stages and $m$ total weight, build the rocket with maximal total weight, or determine, that it is impossible to build a rocket at all. Each stage can be used at most once. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers — $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 50$) – the number of available stages and the number of stages to use in the rocket. The second line contains string $s$, which consists of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters. Each letter defines a new stage, which can be used to build the rocket. Each stage can be used at most once. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimal total weight of the rocket or -1, if it is impossible to build the rocket at all. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 xyabd Output 29 Input 7 4 problem Output 34 Input 2 2 ab Output -1 Input 12 1 abaabbaaabbb Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example, the following rockets satisfy the condition:  "adx" (weight is $1+4+24=29$);  "ady" (weight is $1+4+25=30$);  "bdx" (weight is $2+4+24=30$);  "bdy" (weight is $2+4+25=31$). Rocket "adx" has the minimal weight, so the answer is $29$. In the second example, target rocket is "belo". Its weight is $2+5+12+15=34$. In the third example, $n=k=2$, so the rocket must have both stages: 'a' and 'b'. This rocket doesn't satisfy the condition, because these letters are adjacent in the alphabet. Answer is -1.
