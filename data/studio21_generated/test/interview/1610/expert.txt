 You are given n and k, your task is to print the permutation of length n with decreasing coefficient k 
-----Input----- The single line contains two space-separated integers: n, k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ k < n) — the permutation length and the decreasing coefficient. -----Output----- In a single line print n space-separated integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} — the permutation of length n with decreasing coefficient k.  If there are several permutations that meet this condition, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the permutation with the sought parameters exists. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 Output 1 5 2 4 3 Input 3 0 Output 1 2 3 Input 3 2 Output 3 2 1
