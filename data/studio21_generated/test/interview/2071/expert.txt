     You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.
-----Input----- The first line contains the number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the length of the glade. The second line contains n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the growth rate of mushrooms in the first row of the glade. The third line contains n numbers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^6) is the growth rate of mushrooms in the second row of the glade. -----Output----- Output one number — the maximum total weight of mushrooms that Vasya can collect by choosing the optimal route. Pay attention that Vasya must visit every cell of the glade exactly once. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 6 5 4 Output 70 Input 3 1 1000 10000 10 100 100000 Output 543210 -----Note----- In the first test case, the optimal route is as follows:  [Image]  Thus, the collected weight of mushrooms will be 0·1 + 1·2 + 2·3 + 3·4 + 4·5 + 5·6 = 70. In the second test case, the optimal route is as follows:  [Image]  Thus, the collected weight of mushrooms will be 0·1 + 1·10 + 2·100 + 3·1000 + 4·10000 + 5·100000 = 543210.
