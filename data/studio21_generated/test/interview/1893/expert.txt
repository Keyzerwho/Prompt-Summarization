 You are given an integer $n$. You need to prepare information that will change every second to display on the indicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors increases exactly $n$ times. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains a pair of integers n (1000 ≤ n ≤ 10 000) and t (0 ≤ t ≤ 2 000 000 000) — the number of transistors in the initial time and the number of seconds passed since the initial time. -----Output----- Output one number — the estimate of the number of transistors in a dence integrated circuit in t seconds since the initial time. The relative error of your answer should not be greater than 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 1000 1000000 Output 1011.060722383550382782399454922040
