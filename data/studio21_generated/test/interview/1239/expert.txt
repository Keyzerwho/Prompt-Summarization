 You are given two cities. You need to find the distance between them and the quantity of pairs which have this distance. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). The second line contains n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). All numbers a_{i} are pairwise distinct. -----Output----- Print two integer numbers — the minimal distance and the quantity of pairs with this distance. -----Examples----- Input 4 6 -3 0 4 Output 2 1 Input 3 -2 0 2 Output 2 2 -----Note----- In the first example the distance between the first city and the fourth city is |4 - 6| = 2, and it is the only pair with this distance.
