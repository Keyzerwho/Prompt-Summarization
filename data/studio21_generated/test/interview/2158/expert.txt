 You are given a tree with n nodes. Each node has a number of connections (i.e. friends). You are asked to deliver a message to one of the nodes. You are given the amount of money required to travel between any two nodes. Find the maximal amount of money you will waste on travel if it really is a prank. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the number of friends n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100). The next n - 1 lines each contain three space-separated integers u, v and c (0 ≤ u, v ≤ n - 1, 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^4), meaning that u and v are friends (know each other directly) and the cost for travelling between u and v is c. It is guaranteed that the social network of the input forms a tree. -----Output----- Output a single integer – the maximum sum of costs. -----Examples----- Input 4 0 1 4 0 2 2 2 3 3 Output 5 Input 6 1 2 3 0 2 100 1 4 2 0 3 7 3 5 10 Output 105 Input 11 1 0 1664 2 0 881 3 2 4670 4 2 1555 5 1 1870 6 2 1265 7 2 288 8 7 2266 9 2 1536 10 6 3378 Output 5551 -----Note----- In the second example, the worst-case scenario goes like this: Jenny sends Heidi to the friend labeled by number 2 (incurring a cost of 100), then friend 2 sends her to friend 1 (costing Heidi 3), and finally friend 1 relays her to friend 4 (incurring an additional cost of 2).
