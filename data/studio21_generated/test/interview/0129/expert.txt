 You are given an integer N and K. You need to find minimum number of coins that can be bought.  The coins are of two types. One type, Ivan already has. Second type, Ivan doesn't already have.
-----Input----- The only line of input contains 4 integers $N$, $M$, $K$, $L$ ($1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$; $1 \le M, \,\, L \le 10^{18}$) — quantity of different coins, number of Ivan's friends, size of Ivan's collection and quantity of coins, that must be new in Ivan's collection. -----Output----- Print one number — minimal number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. If it is impossible to satisfy all three conditions print "-1" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 20 15 2 3 Output 1 Input 10 11 2 4 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first test, one coin from each friend is enough, as he will be presented with 15 different coins and 13 of them will definitely be new. In the second test, Ivan has 11 friends, but there are only 10 different coins. So all friends can't present him different coins.
