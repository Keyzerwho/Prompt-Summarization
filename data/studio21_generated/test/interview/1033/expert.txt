 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The only line contains two integer numbers n and H (1 ≤ n, H ≤ 10^18) — the number of sand packs you have and the height of the fence, respectively. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of spots you can occupy so the all the castle building conditions hold. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 Output 3 Input 6 8 Output 3 -----Note----- Here are the heights of some valid castles:   n = 5, H = 2, [2, 2, 1, 0, ...], [2, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...], [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, ...]  n = 6, H = 8, [3, 2, 1, 0, ...], [2, 2, 1, 1, 0, ...], [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0...] (this one has 5 spots occupied)  The first list for both cases is the optimal answer, 3 spots are occupied in them. And here are some invalid ones:  n = 5, H = 2, [3, 2, 0, ...], [2, 3, 0, ...], [1, 0, 2, 2, ...]  n = 6, H = 8, [2, 2, 2, 0, ...], [6, 0, ...], [1, 4, 1, 0...], [2, 2, 1, 0, ...]
