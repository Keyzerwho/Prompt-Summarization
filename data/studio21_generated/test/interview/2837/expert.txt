 You are given n resistors. You need to find the equivalent resistance. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq $N$ \leq 9$) from the task. The following line contains $N$ real numbers $R_ i$ ($0 < R_ i < 100$) from the task. The last line contains the circuit $S$, that will not be longer than $100000$ characters. $S$ will only consist of the following characters: ‘R’, ‘1’–‘9’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘-’ and ‘|’. The number of pairs of brackets will be minimal, and the brackets will be paired properly. Inside of a pair of brackets, there will not be the character ‘-’ and the character ‘|’ at the same time. The circuit will only consist of the resistors from the kit and it is possible that not all types of resistors are used, or that one type of resistor is used several times. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the number from the task. An absolute error up to $10^{-5}$ will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 3 6 (R1-R2-R3) Sample Output 1: 11.00000 Sample Input 2: 3 2 3 6 (R1|R2|R3) Sample Output 2: 1.00000
