 You are given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You should determine minimum possible total instability. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains 2·n integer numbers w_1, w_2, ..., w_2n, where w_{i} is weight of person i (1 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 1000). -----Output----- Print minimum possible total instability. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 3 4 Output 1 Input 4 1 3 4 6 3 4 100 200 Output 5
