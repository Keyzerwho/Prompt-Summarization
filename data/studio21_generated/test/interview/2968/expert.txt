 You are given a list of $n$ integers $s_i$, $i=1,2,...,n$. You need to output the minimum number of kayaks that should be used. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three non-negative integers $b$, $n$, and $e$, denoting the number of beginners, normal participants, and experienced kayakers, respectively. The total number of participants, $b+n+e$, will be even, at least $2$, and no more than $100000$. This is followed by a line with three integers $s_ b$, $s_ n$, and $s_ e$, giving the strengths of the corresponding participants ($1 \leq s_ b < s_ n < s_ e \leq 1000$). The third and final line contains $m = \frac{b+n+e}{2}$ integers $c_1, \ldots , c_ m$ ($1 \leq c_ i \leq 100000$ for each $i$), each giving the speed factor of one kayak. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the maximum speed that the slowest kayak can get by distributing the participants two in each kayak. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 0 40 60 90 18 20 Sample Output: 1600
