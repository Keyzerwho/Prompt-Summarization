 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the only positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) which equals the number of unit segments the robot traveled. The second line contains the movements protocol, which consists of n letters, each being equal either L, or R, or U, or D. k-th letter stands for the direction which Robot traveled the k-th unit segment in: L means that it moved to the left, R — to the right, U — to the top and D — to the bottom. Have a look at the illustrations for better explanation. -----Output----- The only line of input should contain the minimum possible length of the sequence. -----Examples----- Input 4 RURD Output 2 Input 6 RRULDD Output 2 Input 26 RRRULURURUULULLLDLDDRDRDLD Output 7 Input 3 RLL Output 2 Input 4 LRLR Output 4 -----Note----- The illustrations to the first three tests are given below.
