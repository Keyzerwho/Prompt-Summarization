 You are given two integers n and i. Your task is to rearrange the cubes such that, reversing all segments of cubes from i-th to (n - i + 1)-th will give you back the initial order of the cubes. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of cubes. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9), where a_{i} is the number written on the i-th cube after Dima has changed their order. -----Output----- Print n integers, separated by spaces — the numbers written on the cubes in their initial order. It can be shown that the answer is unique. -----Examples----- Input 7 4 3 7 6 9 1 2 Output 2 3 9 6 7 1 4 Input 8 6 1 4 2 5 6 9 2 Output 2 1 6 2 5 4 9 6 -----Note----- Consider the first sample.  At the begining row was [2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4].  After first operation row was [4, 1, 7, 6, 9, 3, 2].  After second operation row was [4, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 2].  After third operation row was [4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2].  At fourth operation we reverse just middle element, so nothing has changed. The final row is [4, 3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 2]. So the answer for this case is row [2, 3, 9, 6, 7, 1, 4].
