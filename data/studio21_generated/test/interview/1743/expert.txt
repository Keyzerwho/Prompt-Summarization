 You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000) — the number of hares. Then three lines follow, each line has n integers. The first line contains integers a_1 a_2 ... a_{n}. The second line contains b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}. The third line contains c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n}. The following limits are fulfilled: 0 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} ≤ 10^5. Number a_{i} in the first line shows the joy that hare number i gets if his adjacent hares are both hungry. Number b_{i} in the second line shows the joy that hare number i radiates if he has exactly one full adjacent hare. Number с_{i} in the third line shows the joy that hare number i radiates if both his adjacent hares are full. -----Output----- In a single line, print the maximum possible total joy of the hares Inna can get by feeding them. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 0 1 1 0 Output 13 Input 7 8 5 7 6 1 8 9 2 7 9 5 4 3 1 2 3 3 4 1 1 3 Output 44 Input 3 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 Output 4
