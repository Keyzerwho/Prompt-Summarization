 You are given a number $n$ and a value $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $m$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The second line contains m integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 3 2 3 Output 6 Input 4 3 2 3 3 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.
