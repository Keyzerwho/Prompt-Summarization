 You are given a string of ones and zeros, and an integer $k$. Return a string containing $k$ ones and $k$ zeros such that the number of bit changes is at most $k$. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with three integers $n$, $c$, and $b$ ($2 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq c, b \le n-1$), the size of the hard drive in bits, the desired amount of bit changes, and the number of broken bits. The positions on the hard drive are numbered from $1$ to $n$.  - One line with $b$ integers $z_1, \ldots , z_ b$ ($2 \leq z_1 < z_2 < \ldots < z_ b = n$), the positions of the broken bits on the hard drive. -----Output----- Output a bit string of length $n$, representing Piaâ€™s hard drive and containing exactly $c$ bit changes. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 2 3 2 3 5 Sample Output: 00010
