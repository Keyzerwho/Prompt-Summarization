 You are given H strings S_i (1 \leq i \leq H), each of length W. If the j-th character (1 \leq j \leq W) of S_i is #, there is an obstacle on the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left; if that character is ., there is no obstacle on that square. Find the maximum possible number of squares lighted by the lamp. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: H W S_1 : S_H -----Output----- Print the maximum possible number of squares lighted by the lamp. -----Sample Input----- 4 6 #..#.. .....# ....#. #.#... -----Sample Output----- 8 If Snuke places the lamp on the square at the second row from the top and the second column from the left, it will light the following squares: the first through fifth squares from the left in the second row, and the first through fourth squares from the top in the second column, for a total of eight squares.
