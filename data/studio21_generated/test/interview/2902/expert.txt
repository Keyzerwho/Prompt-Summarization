 You are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order  
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three space-separated integers, $C$, $N$, and $M$, where $C$ ($1 \leq C \leq 1000$) is the maximum number of cows allowed on a farm, $N$ ($0 \leq N \leq 1000$) is the number of farms with at least one cow on Day $0$, and $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq 50$) is the number of different days on which the Regulator visits. The following $N$ lines of input each have a single integer $c_ i$($1 \leq c_ i \leq C$), representing the number of cows on the $i$th of the $N$ farms on Day $0$. The final $M$ lines each have a single integer $d_ j$ ($0 \leq d_ j \leq 50$), representing a day when the Regulator visits. All $d_ j$ are distinct. -----Output----- For each $d_ j$, output one line with a single integer: the number of farms the Regulator will inspect on Day $d_ j$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 5 5 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 3 4 Sample Output: 5 10 20 40 80
