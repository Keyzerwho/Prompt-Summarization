-----Input----- The first line of each test contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 1500$, $1 \le k \le 30$) — number of cards and number of features. Each of the following $n$ lines contains a card description: a string consisting of $k$ letters "S", "E", "T". The $i$-th character of this string decribes the $i$-th feature of that card. All cards are distinct. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the number of ways to choose three cards that form a set. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 SET ETS TSE Output 1 Input 3 4 SETE ETSE TSES Output 0 Input 5 4 SETT TEST EEET ESTE STES Output 2 -----Note----- In the third example test, these two triples of cards are sets:  "SETT", "TEST", "EEET"  "TEST", "ESTE", "STES"
