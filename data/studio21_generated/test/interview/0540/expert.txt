 You are staying in the cell (r_1, c_1) and this cell is cracked because you've just fallen here from a higher level. You need to fall down through the cell (r_2, c_2) since the exit to the next level is there. Can you do this  
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) — the number of rows and columns in the cave description. Each of the next n lines describes the initial state of the level of the cave, each line consists of m characters "." (that is, intact ice) and "X" (cracked ice). The next line contains two integers, r_1 and c_1 (1 ≤ r_1 ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_1 ≤ m) — your initial coordinates. It is guaranteed that the description of the cave contains character 'X' in cell (r_1, c_1), that is, the ice on the starting cell is initially cracked. The next line contains two integers r_2 and c_2 (1 ≤ r_2 ≤ n, 1 ≤ c_2 ≤ m) — the coordinates of the cell through which you need to fall. The final cell may coincide with the starting one. -----Output----- If you can reach the destination, print 'YES', otherwise print 'NO'. -----Examples----- Input 4 6 X...XX ...XX. .X..X. ...... 1 6 2 2 Output YES Input 5 4 .X.. ...X X.X. .... .XX. 5 3 1 1 Output NO Input 4 7 ..X.XX. .XX..X. X...X.. X...... 2 2 1 6 Output YES -----Note----- In the first sample test one possible path is: [Image] After the first visit of cell (2, 2) the ice on it cracks and when you step there for the second time, your character falls through the ice as intended.
