 You are given an NxN board. You are playing tic-tac-toe with your opponent. You have one move left. Win the game. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases. First line of each testcase contains two integers N and K, next N lines contains N characters each. Each character is either an 'X' denoting that the first player used this cell, an 'O' meaning that the second player used this cell, or a '.' (a period) representing a free cell. -----Output----- For each testcase, output, in a single line, "YES" if Chef can win in one move, or "NO" otherwise. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 3 ≤ N ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ K ≤ N -----Example----- Input: 3 3 3 XOX O.O XOX 3 1 ... ... ... 3 2 ... ... ... Output: YES YES NO Input: 1 4 4 XOXO OX.. XO.. OXOX Output: YES -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1:  K  = 1. Points - 10 - Subtask 2:  N  =  K  = 3. Points - 30 - Subtask 3: Original constraints. Points - 60 -----Explanation----- Test #1: In first testcase, put 'X' in (2, 2), in second we can put 'X' in any cell and win.  Test #2: If you put an 'X' in (3, 3), there will be four 'X's on the main diagonal (1, 1) - (2, 2) - (3, 3) - (4, 4).
