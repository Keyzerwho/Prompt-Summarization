 You are given n integers.  Write a program that prints all integers that you can write on a card so that the described condition fulfilled. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of cards. The next line contains the sequence of integers — the numbers on Alexander's cards. The numbers are positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed 10^8. -----Output----- If Arthur can write infinitely many distinct integers on the card, print on a single line -1. Otherwise, print on the first line the number of integers that suit you. In the second line, print the numbers in the increasing order. Note that the numbers in the answer can exceed 10^8 or even be negative (see test samples). -----Examples----- Input 3 4 1 7 Output 2 -2 10 Input 1 10 Output -1 Input 4 1 3 5 9 Output 1 7 Input 4 4 3 4 5 Output 0 Input 2 2 4 Output 3 0 3 6
