 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n — the initial number of trees in the woodland belt, 2 ≤ n. The second line contains space-separated integers a_{i} — the esthetic appeals of each tree. All esthetic appeals do not exceed 10^9 in their absolute value.  to get 30 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 100 (subproblem A1);  to get 100 points, you need to solve the problem with constraints: n ≤ 3·10^5 (subproblems A1+A2).  -----Output----- In the first line print two integers — the total esthetic appeal of the woodland belt after the Smart Beaver's intervention and the number of the cut down trees k. In the next line print k integers — the numbers of the trees the Beaver needs to cut down. Assume that the trees are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at least two trees have equal esthetic appeal. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 1 2 Output 8 1 1  Input 5 1 -2 3 1 -2 Output 5 2 2 5
