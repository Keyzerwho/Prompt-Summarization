 You are given a pile of $N$ pebbles. You need to output the minimum number of pebbles that Mirko must take during his first turn such that he is guaranteed to win the game. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 10^{15}$), the number of pebbles in the starting heap. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required minimum number of pebbles that Mirko needs to remove during his first turn. -----Explanation of Sample Input 1----- Mirko has $4$ possibilities to choose from: he can take $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$ pebbles from the heap. If he takes all $4$ pebbles he will naturally win, but that is not the minimum solution. We need to check the remaining alternatives. If Mirko takes only one pebble, Slavko is left with a heap of $3$, but he can take at most $2$. Slavko cannot take all pebbles, but Mirko will be able to take all remaining pebbles during his next turn, winning the game. We conclude that $1$ is the minimum solution for this test case. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 7 Sample Output 2: 2
