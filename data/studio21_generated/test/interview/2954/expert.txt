 Anthony is traveling from intersection $s$ to intersection $t$ in ByteLand. Anthony must choose a path that maximizes $D$, the minimum distance between any intersection on the path and any spider, such that the path can be traveled in no more than $T$ seconds. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $N$ ($2\leq N\leq 100000$), $M$ ($1\leq M\leq \min (200000, n(n-1)/2)$), and $T$ ($1\leq T\leq 10^9$). Each of the next $M$ lines specify the roads. A road is described by three integers $u, v$ ($0\leq u, v\leq N-1$ and $u\neq v$) and $d$ ($1\leq d\leq 10000$), which means that a $d$ meters long road connects intersections $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that at most one road connect any two intersections, and that there exists a path between any two intersections. The next line contains $s, t$ ($0\leq s, t\leq N-1$ and $s\neq t$, representing Anthonyâ€™s current location and the location of the concert. You may assume Anthony can always travel from $s$ to $t$ in no more than $T$ seconds. The last line contains a integer $1\leq K\leq N$, denoting the number of intersections occupied by spiders, followed by $K$ integers $0\leq a_ i\leq N-1$ denoting the intersections with spiders. -----Output----- Print the maximum $D$ (as defined earlier) for the path Anthony takes. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 4 3000 0 1 1 1 3 1 2 0 2018 2 3 42 0 3 1 1 Sample Output: 1
