 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A, you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100000) denoting the number of brains (which are conveniently numbered from 1 to n) and the number of brain connectors in the nervous system, respectively. In the next m lines, descriptions of brain connectors follow. Every connector is given as a pair of brains a b it connects (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b). -----Output----- Print one number – the brain latency. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output 2 Input 5 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5 Output 3
