 You are given a string s.  Each character of s has at most one lowercase English letter.  For each substring of s, if substring has at least two equal characters, then Kerem will change characters at some positions to some other lowercase English letters.  
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the length of the string s. The second line contains the string s of length n consisting of only lowercase English letters. -----Output----- If it's impossible to change the string s such that all its substring are distinct print -1. Otherwise print the minimum required number of changes. -----Examples----- Input 2 aa Output 1 Input 4 koko Output 2 Input 5 murat Output 0 -----Note----- In the first sample one of the possible solutions is to change the first character to 'b'. In the second sample, one may change the first character to 'a' and second character to 'b', so the string becomes "abko".
