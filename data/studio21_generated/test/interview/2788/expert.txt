 The input given are two non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer, $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$), the number of groups of friends. The next line contains $n$ space separated integers, $s_0, s_1, \ldots , s_{n-1}\ (0 < s_ i \leq 100)$, where $s_ i$ denotes the size of group $i$. The next line contains $4$ space separated integers: $k$ ($0 < k \leq 100$), $x$ ($0 < x \leq 100000$), $a$ and $b$ ($0 < a \leq b \leq 10000$) representing the number of bins, the number of lunches in each bin, the minimum number of campers you must watch, and the maximum number of campers you are allowed to watch, respectively. -----Output----- Output an integer denoting the maximum number of students you can take to lunch and satisfy the requirements, or, if it is not possible, output ‘impossible’. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 5 7 10 15 3 2 8 20 3 30 40 Sample Output 1: 39 Sample Input 2: 7 33 7 10 15 3 2 8 20 3 30 40 Sample Output 2: 36
