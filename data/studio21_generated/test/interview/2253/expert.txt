 You are given three languages, three suffixes, and a sentence. Your task is to determine the language of the sentence. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 30$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.  Each test case consists of a single line containing a single string denoting the sentence. Spaces are represented as underscores (the symbol "_") for ease of reading. The sentence has at least $1$ and at most $1000$ characters, and consists only of lowercase English letters and underscores. The sentence has no leading or trailing underscores and no two consecutive underscores. It is guaranteed that the sentence ends with one of the four suffixes mentioned above. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing either "FILIPINO", "JAPANESE", or "KOREAN" (all in uppercase, without quotes), depending on the detected language. -----Example----- Input 8 kamusta_po genki_desu ohayou_gozaimasu annyeong_hashimnida hajime_no_ippo bensamu_no_sentou_houhou_ga_okama_kenpo ang_halaman_doon_ay_sarisari_singkamasu si_roy_mustang_ay_namamasu Output FILIPINO JAPANESE JAPANESE KOREAN FILIPINO FILIPINO JAPANESE JAPANESE -----Note----- The first sentence ends with "po", so it is written in Filipino. The second and third sentences end with "desu" and "masu", so they are written in Japanese. The fourth sentence ends with "mnida", so it is written in Korean.
