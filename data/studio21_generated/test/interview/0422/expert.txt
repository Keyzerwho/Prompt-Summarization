 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the number of pages in which there are no more than $k$ tables in a row and no more than $k$ formulas in a row. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le k \le 10^6$). The second line contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($1 \le x_i \le 10^6$) — the number of tables on the $i$-th page. The third line contains $n$ integers $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n$ ($1 \le y_i \le 10^6$) — the number of formulas on the $i$-th page. -----Output----- Print "YES" if Vova can rearrange tables and formulas on each page in such a way that there is no more than $k$ tables in a row and no more than $k$ formulas in a row. Otherwise print "NO". -----Examples----- Input 2 2 5 5 2 2 Output YES Input 2 2 5 6 2 2 Output NO Input 4 1 4 1 10 1 3 2 10 1 Output YES -----Note----- In the first example the only option to rearrange everything is the following (let table be 'T' and formula be 'F'):   page $1$: "TTFTTFT"  page $2$: "TFTTFTT"  That way all blocks of tables have length $2$. In the second example there is no way to fit everything in such a way that there are no more than $2$ tables in a row and $2$ formulas in a row.
