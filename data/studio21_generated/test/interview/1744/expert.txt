 You are given a list of $n$ students. Each student will take an exam one-by-one. Each student has a ticket. The ticket may be easy or hard. The student does not answer the exam if the ticket is too hard. If the ticket is too easy, the student spends exactly $t_i$ minutes to pass the exam. The student answers the exam after spending $t_i$ minutes, so the student has exactly $t_i$ minutes to pass the exam. The exam is timed. Students take the exam one-by-one in fixed order. There is fixed number of minutes $M$ for exam. At any moment of time, Polygraph Poligrafovich takes the answer from one student. The duration of the whole exam for all students is $M$ minutes. For each student $i$, find the minimum possible number of students who need to fail the exam so the $i$-th student has enough time to pass the exam ($\max t_i \le M$). For each student $i$, find the answer independently. That is, if when finding the answer for the student $i_1$ some student $j$ should leave, then while finding the answer for $i_2$ ($i_2>i_
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $M$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le M \le 2 \cdot 10^7$) — the number of students and the total duration of the exam in minutes, respectively. The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $t_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 100$) — time in minutes that $i$-th student spends to answer to a ticket. It's guaranteed that all values of $t_i$ are not greater than $M$. -----Output----- Print $n$ numbers: the $i$-th number must be equal to the minimum number of students who have to leave the exam in order to $i$-th student has enough time to pass the exam. -----Examples----- Input 7 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Output 0 0 0 0 0 2 3  Input 5 100 80 40 40 40 60 Output 0 1 1 2 3  -----Note----- The explanation for the example 1. Please note that the sum of the first five exam times does not exceed $M=15$ (the sum is $1+2+3+4+5=15$). Thus, the first five students can pass the exam even if all the students before them also pass the exam. In other words, the first five numbers in the answer are $0$. In order for the $6$-th student to pass the exam, it is necessary that at least $2$ students must fail it before (for example, the $3$-rd and $4$-th, then the $6$-th will finish its exam in $1+2+5+6=14$ minutes, which does not exceed $M$). In order for the $7$-th student to pass the exam, it is necessary that at least $3$ students must fail it before (for example, the $2$-nd, $5$-th and $6$-th, then the $7$-th will finish its exam in $1+3+4+7=15$ minutes, which does not exceed $M$).
