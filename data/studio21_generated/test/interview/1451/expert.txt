 You are given n positive integers and k. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the numbers that Roma has.  The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 1 2 4 Output 3 Input 3 2 447 44 77 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample all numbers contain at most four lucky digits, so the answer is 3. In the second sample number 447 doesn't fit in, as it contains more than two lucky digits. All other numbers are fine, so the answer is 2.
