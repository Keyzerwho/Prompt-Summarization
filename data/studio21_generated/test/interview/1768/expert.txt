 You are given n, m, and q. You need to find the maximum Koyomity achievable after repainting the garland according to each plan. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 500) — the length of the garland. The second line contains n lowercase English letters s_1s_2... s_{n} as a string — the initial colours of paper pieces on the garland. The third line contains a positive integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of plans Nadeko has. The next q lines describe one plan each: the i-th among them contains an integer m_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i} ≤ n) — the maximum amount of pieces to repaint, followed by a space, then by a lowercase English letter c_{i} — Koyomi's possible favourite colour. -----Output----- Output q lines: for each work plan, output one line containing an integer — the largest Koyomity achievable after repainting the garland according to it. -----Examples----- Input 6 koyomi 3 1 o 4 o 4 m Output 3 6 5 Input 15 yamatonadeshiko 10 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 b 5 b Output 3 4 5 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 Input 10 aaaaaaaaaa 2 10 b 10 z Output 10 10 -----Note----- In the first sample, there are three plans:   In the first plan, at most 1 piece can be repainted. Repainting the "y" piece to become "o" results in "kooomi", whose Koyomity of 3 is the best achievable;  In the second plan, at most 4 pieces can be repainted, and "oooooo" results in a Koyomity of 6;  In the third plan, at most 4 pieces can be repainted, and "mmmmmi" and "kmmmmm" both result in a Koyomity of 5.
