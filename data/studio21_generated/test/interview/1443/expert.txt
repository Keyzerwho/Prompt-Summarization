 You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges. You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct all undirected edges. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the number of segments of terrain.  The second line contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \dots, l_n$ ($1 \leq l_i \leq 10^{12}$). The $l_i$ represents the length of the $i$-th terrain segment in meters. The third line contains a string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters "G", "W", "L", representing Grass, Water and Lava, respectively.  It is guaranteed that the first segment is not Lava. -----Output----- Output a single integer $t$ — the minimum time Bob needs to reach Alice.  -----Examples----- Input 1 10 G Output 30 Input 2 10 10 WL Output 40 Input 2 1 2 WL Output 8 Input 3 10 10 10 GLW Output 80 -----Note----- In the first sample, Bob first walks $5$ meters in $25$ seconds. Then he flies the remaining $5$ meters in $5$ seconds. In the second sample, Bob first swims $10$ meters in $30$ seconds. Then he flies over the patch of lava for $10$ seconds. In the third sample, the water pond is much smaller. Bob first swims over the water pond, taking him $3$ seconds. However, he cannot fly over the lava just yet, as he only has one stamina while he needs two. So he swims back for half a meter, and then half a meter forward, taking him $3$ seconds in total. Now he has $2$ stamina, so he can spend $2$ seconds flying over the lava. In the fourth sample, he walks for $50$ seconds, flies for $10$ seconds, swims for $15$ seconds, and finally flies for $5$ seconds.
