 You are given an integer a. Find the minimum positive integer b, such that, if he walks b floors higher, he will arrive at a floor with a lucky number. 
-----Input----- The only line of input contains an integer a ( - 10^9 ≤ a ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print the minimum b in a line. -----Examples----- Input 179 Output 1 Input -1 Output 9 Input 18 Output 10 -----Note----- For the first sample, he has to arrive at the floor numbered 180. For the second sample, he will arrive at 8. Note that b should be positive, so the answer for the third sample is 10, not 0.
