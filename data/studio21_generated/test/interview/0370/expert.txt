 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: K X Y -----Output----- If the game cannot be finished, print -1. If the game can be finished, print one way to bring the ball to the destination with the lowest score possible, in the following format: s x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 . . . x_s y_s Here, s is the lowest score possible, and (x_i, y_i) is the position of the ball just after the i-th stroke. -----Sample Input----- 11 -1 2 -----Sample Output----- 3 7 4 2 10 -1 2  - The Manhattan distance between (0, 0) and (7, 4) is |0-7|+|0-4|=11.  - The Manhattan distance between (7, 4) and (2, 10) is |7-2|+|4-10|=11.  - The Manhattan distance between (2, 10) and (-1, 2) is |2-(-1)|+|10-2|=11. Thus, this play is valid. Also, there is no way to finish the game with less than three strokes.
