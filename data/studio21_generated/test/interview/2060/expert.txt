 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $x$. You are given a list of two non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. Return the number of chicken chunks that Ivan can buy. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of testcases. The i-th of the following n lines contains one integer x_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 100) — the number of chicken chunks Ivan wants to eat. -----Output----- Print n lines, in i-th line output YES if Ivan can buy exactly x_{i} chunks. Otherwise, print NO. -----Example----- Input 2 6 5 Output YES NO -----Note----- In the first example Ivan can buy two small portions. In the second example Ivan cannot buy exactly 5 chunks, since one small portion is not enough, but two small portions or one large is too much.
