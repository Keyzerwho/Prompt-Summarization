 You are given two integers m and n. You know that m and a are located on the same distance from c, and you know that c is the equiprobably chosen integer from 1 to n (inclusive). You need to determine which value of a Andrew must choose, so that the probability of his victory is the highest possible. More formally, you need to find such integer a (1   a   n), that the probability that $|c - a|<|c - m|$ is maximal, where c is the equiprobably chosen integer from 1 to n (inclusive). 


-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the range of numbers in the game, and the number selected by Misha respectively. -----Output----- Print a single number — such value a, that probability that Andrew wins is the highest. If there are multiple such values, print the minimum of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 Output 2 Input 4 3 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 2 or 3. The probability that Andrew wins is 2 / 3. If Andrew chooses a = 3, the probability of winning will be 1 / 3. If a = 1, the probability of winning is 0. In the second sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 1 and 2. The probability that Andrew wins is 1 / 2. For other choices of a the probability of winning is less.
