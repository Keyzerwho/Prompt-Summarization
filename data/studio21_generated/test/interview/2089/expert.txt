 You are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order  
-----Input----- The firt line of the input contains integers n, m, s and t (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ s, t ≤ n, s ≠ t) — the number of junctions and the number of roads in Nsk, as well as the indices of junctions where mayors home and work are located respectively. The i-th of the following m lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n, u_{i} ≠ v_{i}), meaning that this road connects junctions u_{i} and v_{i} directly. It is guaranteed that there is a path between any two junctions and no two roads connect the same pair of junctions. -----Output----- Print one integer — the number of pairs of junctions not connected by a direct road, such that building a road between these two junctions won't decrease the distance between junctions s and t. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 1 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 Output 0 Input 5 4 3 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 Output 5 Input 5 6 1 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 4 5 3 5 2 5 Output 3
