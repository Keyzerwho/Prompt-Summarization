 You are given two sequences S and T of length N consisting of 0 and 1. You need to compute the sum of f(S, T) over all of those pairs, modulo (10^9+7). 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N C_1 C_2 \cdots C_N -----Output----- Print the sum of f(S, T), modulo (10^9+7). -----Sample Input----- 1 1000000000 -----Sample Output----- 999999993 There are two pairs (S, T) of different sequences of length 2 consisting of 0 and 1, as follows:  - S = (0), T = (1): by changing S_1 to 1, we can have S = T at the cost of 1000000000, so f(S, T) = 1000000000.  - S = (1), T = (0): by changing S_1 to 0, we can have S = T at the cost of 1000000000, so f(S, T) = 1000000000. The sum of these is 2000000000, and we should print it modulo (10^9+7), that is, 999999993.
