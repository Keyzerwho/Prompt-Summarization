 You are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) — the number of days.  The second line contains N integers V_1, V_2, ..., V_{N} (0 ≤ V_{i} ≤ 10^9), where V_{i} is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day i. The third line contains N integers T_1, T_2, ..., T_{N} (0 ≤ T_{i} ≤ 10^9), where T_{i} is the temperature on the day i. -----Output----- Output a single line with N integers, where the i-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on day i. -----Examples----- Input 3 10 10 5 5 7 2 Output 5 12 4 Input 5 30 25 20 15 10 9 10 12 4 13 Output 9 20 35 11 25 -----Note----- In the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.
