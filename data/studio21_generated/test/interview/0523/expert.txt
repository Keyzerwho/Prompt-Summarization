 You are given $n$ distinct strings of equal length $m$. You want to discard some of the strings (possibly none or all) and reorder the remaining strings so that the concatenation becomes a palindrome. You also want the length of the palindrome to be as long as possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le m \le 50$) â€” the number of strings and the length of each string. Next $n$ lines contain a string of length $m$ each, consisting of lowercase Latin letters only. All strings are distinct. -----Output----- In the first line, print the length of the longest palindrome string you made. In the second line, print that palindrome. If there are multiple answers, print any one of them. If the palindrome is empty, print an empty line or don't print this line at all. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 tab one bat Output 6 tabbat Input 4 2 oo ox xo xx Output 6 oxxxxo Input 3 5 hello codef orces Output 0 Input 9 4 abab baba abcd bcde cdef defg wxyz zyxw ijji Output 20 ababwxyzijjizyxwbaba -----Note----- In the first example, "battab" is also a valid answer. In the second example, there can be 4 different valid answers including the sample output. We are not going to provide any hints for what the others are. In the third example, the empty string is the only valid palindrome string.
