 You are given a grid with 2 integers $n$ and $m$. In the top left corner of the grid is $(n,n)$ and in the bottom left corner is $(m,m)$. The bottom left corner is exempt from the rule that Waters can only go diagonally. Waters can move from a square to any other square adjacent by a side, as long as he is still in the grid. Also except for the cells ($1,1$) and ($n,n$) every cell has a value $0$ or $1$ in it. Before starting his traversal he will pick either a $0$ or a $1$ and will be able to only go to cells values in which are equal to the digit he chose. The starting and finishing cells ($1,1$) and ($n,n$) are exempt from this rule, he may go through them regardless of picked digit. Because of this the cell ($1,1$) takes value the letter 'S' and the cell ($n,n$) takes value the letter 'F'. For example, in the first example test case, he can go from ($1, 1$
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 50$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integers $n$ ($3 \le n \le 200$). The following $n$ lines of each test case contain the binary grid, square ($1, 1$) being colored in 'S' and square ($n, n$) being colored in 'F'. The sum of values of $n$ doesn't exceed $200$. -----Output----- For each test case output on the first line an integer $c$ ($0 \le c \le 2$)  — the number of inverted cells. In $i$-th of the following $c$ lines, print the coordinates of the $i$-th cell you inverted. You may not invert the same cell twice.  Note that you cannot invert cells $(1, 1)$ and $(n, n)$. -----Example----- Input 3 4 S010 0001 1000 111F 3 S10 101 01F 5 S0101 00000 01111 11111 0001F Output 1 3 4 2 1 2 2 1 0 -----Note----- For the first test case, after inverting the cell, we get the following grid: S010 0001 1001 111F
