 You are given an array arr. Add the least possible number of operation records to the current log. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of the records left in Petya's journal. Each of the following n lines describe the records in the current log in the order they are applied. Format described in the statement is used. All numbers in the input are integers not exceeding 10^9 by their absolute value. -----Output----- The first line of the output should contain a single integer m — the minimum possible number of records in the modified sequence of operations. Next m lines should contain the corrected sequence of records following the format of the input (described in the statement), one per line and in the order they are applied. All the numbers in the output should be integers not exceeding 10^9 by their absolute value. Note that the input sequence of operations must be the subsequence of the output sequence. It's guaranteed that there exists the correct answer consisting of no more than 1 000 000 operations. -----Examples----- Input 2 insert 3 getMin 4 Output 4 insert 3 removeMin insert 4 getMin 4 Input 4 insert 1 insert 1 removeMin getMin 2 Output 6 insert 1 insert 1 removeMin removeMin insert 2 getMin 2 -----Note----- In the first sample, after number 3 is inserted into the heap, the minimum number is 3. To make the result of the first getMin equal to 4 one should firstly remove number 3 from the heap and then add number 4 into the heap. In the second sample case number 1 is inserted two times, so should be similarly removed twice.
