 You are given a list of $n$ integers. You want to split these integers into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list $A$ to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list $B$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ m ≤ 10) — the number of books in the bookstore and the number of genres. The second line contains a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ m) equals the genre of the i-th book. It is guaranteed that for each genre there is at least one book of that genre. -----Output----- Print the only integer — the number of ways in which Jack can choose books. It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed the value 2·10^9. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 2 1 3 1 Output 5 Input 7 4 4 2 3 1 2 4 3 Output 18 -----Note----- The answer to the first test sample equals 5 as Sasha can choose:  the first and second books,  the first and third books,  the first and fourth books,  the second and third books,  the third and fourth books.
