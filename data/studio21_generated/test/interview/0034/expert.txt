 You are given 2 arrays of integers, array $x$ and array $y$. You need to find the maximum possible number x such that you can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.   
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively. -----Output----- Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 Output 1 Input 4 7 10 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it. In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
