 You are given n integers, a 1, b 2, c 3, d 4, e 5, f 6, g 7, h 8, i 9, j 10, k 11, l 12, m 13, n 14, o 15. You are asked to find the minimum number pages that Ryouko needs to turn. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5). The next line contains m integers separated by spaces: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of pages Ryouko needs to turn. -----Examples----- Input 4 6 1 2 3 4 3 2 Output 3 Input 10 5 9 4 3 8 8 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first sample, the optimal solution is to merge page 4 to 3, after merging sequence a becomes {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2}, so the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn is |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 2| = 3. In the second sample, optimal solution is achieved by merging page 9 to 4.
