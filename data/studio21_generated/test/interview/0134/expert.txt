 You are given three positive integers. You are asked to find the length of some side of a right triangle, such that the corresponding Pythagorean triple can be found. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — the length of some side of a right triangle. -----Output----- Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line. In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 Output 4 5 Input 6 Output 8 10 Input 1 Output -1 Input 17 Output 144 145 Input 67 Output 2244 2245 -----Note-----[Image] Illustration for the first sample.
