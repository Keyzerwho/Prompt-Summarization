 Given two integers $n$ and m, create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $1 \le N \le 10^6$, the number of elements of the permutation $A$, and $1 \le L \le 10^6$, the length of the sequence $G$. The next line contains $L$ positive integers between $1$ and $N$, the elements $g_1, \dots , g_ L$ of the sequence $G$. -----Output----- Output a single integer: the number of $N$-element permutations having the given sequence as its GIS. Since this number may be large, output it modulo the prime number $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 1 1 Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 5 1 5 Sample Output 2: 24 Sample Input 3: 5 3 2 4 5 Sample Output 3: 8
