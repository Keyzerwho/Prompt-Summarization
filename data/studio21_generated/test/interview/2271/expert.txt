 you are given a tree. Count the number of lifelines (paths of length 2) in the given tree. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n – the number of vertices in the tree (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000). The vertices are labeled with the numbers from 1 to n. Then n - 1 lines follow, each describing one edge using two space-separated numbers a b – the labels of the vertices connected by the edge (1 ≤ a < b ≤ n). It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree. -----Output----- Print one integer – the number of lifelines in the tree. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output 3 Input 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5 Output 4 -----Note----- In the second sample, there are four lifelines: paths between vertices 1 and 3, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, and 4 and 5.
