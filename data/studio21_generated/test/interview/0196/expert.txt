 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the expected number of dresses Nastya will have in one year. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The only line contains two integers x and k (0 ≤ x, k ≤ 10^18), where x is the initial number of dresses and k + 1 is the number of months in a year in Byteland. -----Output----- In the only line print a single integer — the expected number of dresses Nastya will own one year later modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 2 0 Output 4 Input 2 1 Output 7 Input 3 2 Output 21 -----Note----- In the first example a year consists on only one month, so the wardrobe does not eat dresses at all. In the second example after the first month there are 3 dresses with 50% probability and 4 dresses with 50% probability. Thus, in the end of the year there are 6 dresses with 50% probability and 8 dresses with 50% probability. This way the answer for this test is (6 + 8) / 2 = 7.
