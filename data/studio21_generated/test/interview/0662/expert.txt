 Your task is to help Alex, Bob and Carl to chek the correctness of their log of games. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of games Alex, Bob and Carl played. Then n lines follow, describing the game log. i-th line contains one integer a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 3) which is equal to 1 if Alex won i-th game, to 2 if Bob won i-th game and 3 if Carl won i-th game. -----Output----- Print YES if the situation described in the log was possible. Otherwise print NO. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 2 Output YES Input 2 1 2 Output NO -----Note----- In the first example the possible situation is:  Alex wins, Carl starts playing instead of Bob;  Alex wins, Bob replaces Carl;  Bob wins.  The situation in the second example is impossible because Bob loses the first game, so he cannot win the second one.
