 You are given N integers. You need to find the median of this new sequence. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N a_1 a_2 ... a_N -----Output----- Print the median of m. -----Sample Input----- 3 10 30 20 -----Sample Output----- 30 The median of each contiguous subsequence of a is as follows:  - The median of (10) is 10.  - The median of (30) is 30.  - The median of (20) is 20.  - The median of (10, 30) is 30.  - The median of (30, 20) is 30.  - The median of (10, 30, 20) is 20. Thus, m = (10, 30, 20, 30, 30, 20) and the median of m is 30.
