 Vasya has measured temperature for n days. One day was negative. One day was positive. He wants that after n days, there will be at least one day which will be negative.
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of days for which Vasya has been measuring the temperature.  The second line contains a sequence of n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (|t_{i}| ≤ 10^9) — the sequence of temperature values. Numbers t_{i} are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the answer to the given task. -----Examples----- Input 4 -1 1 -2 1 Output 1 Input 5 0 -1 1 2 -5 Output 2 -----Note----- Note to the first sample: there are two ways to change exactly one number so that the sequence met Vasya's condition. You can either replace the first number 1 by any negative number or replace the number -2 by any positive number.
