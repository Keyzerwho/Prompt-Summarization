 You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ operations with this array: during the $i$-th operation:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd then assign $a[\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ otherwise assign $a[\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$.  Consider the array $a$ of length $5$ (initially $a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$). Then it changes as follows:  Firstly, we choose the segment $[1; 5]$ and assign $a[3] := 1$, so $a$ becomes $[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers $n$, $k$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{5}$, $1 \le k \le 10^{5}$, $1 \le m \le 10^{7}$) — the number of superheroes, the maximum number of times you can increase power of a particular superhero, and the total maximum number of operations. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^{6}$) — the initial powers of the superheroes in the cast of avengers. -----Output----- Output a single number — the maximum final average power. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Input 2 4 6 4 7 Output 11.00000000000000000000 Input 4 2 6 1 3 2 3 Output 5.00000000000000000000 -----Note----- In the first example, the maximum average is obtained by deleting the first element and increasing the second element four times. In the second sample, one of the ways to achieve maximum average is to delete the first and the third element and increase the second and the fourth elements by $2$ each.
