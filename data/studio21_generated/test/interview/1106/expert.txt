 You have n lights to be placed along roads. You need to find minimum number of lights to be places so that a path from entrance to any exit of the park contains the same number of street lights. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the number of roads on the path from the entrance to any exit. The next line contains 2^{n} + 1 - 2 numbers a_2, a_3, ... a_2^{n} + 1 - 1 — the initial numbers of street lights on each road of the park. Here a_{i} is the number of street lights on the road between squares i and $\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \rfloor$. All numbers a_{i} are positive integers, not exceeding 100. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of street lights that we should add to the roads of the park to make Om Nom feel safe. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 Output 5 -----Note----- Picture for the sample test. Green color denotes the additional street lights. [Image]
