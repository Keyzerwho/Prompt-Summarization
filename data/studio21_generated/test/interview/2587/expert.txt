 You are given a number $x$. You need to check if $r$ (as number) is maximum possible. 
Note: in this task, we compare integers ($x$ or $k$) as numbers (despite what representations they are written in), so $729 < 1999$ or $111 < 1000$. -----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain test cases — one per test case. The one and only line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the length of the integer $x$ you need to find. It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ from all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, print the minimum integer $x$ of length $n$ such that obtained by Denis number $r$ is maximum possible. -----Example----- Input 2 1 3 Output 8 998 -----Note----- In the second test case (with $n = 3$), if uncle Bogdan had $x = 998$ then $k = 100110011000$. Denis (by wiping last $n = 3$ digits) will obtain $r = 100110011$. It can be proved that the $100110011$ is the maximum possible $r$ Denis can obtain and $998$ is the minimum $x$ to obtain it.
