 You are given $n$ integers. You need to find minimum number of operations required to make all the chemical volumes equal. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of chemicals. The second line contains n space separated integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5), representing the initial volume of the i-th chemical in liters. -----Output----- Output one integer the minimum number of operations required to make all the chemicals volumes equal. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 8 2 Output 2 Input 3 3 5 6 Output 5 -----Note----- In the first sample test, the optimal solution is to divide the second chemical volume by two, and multiply the third chemical volume by two to make all the volumes equal 4. In the second sample test, the optimal solution is to divide the first chemical volume by two, and divide the second and the third chemical volumes by two twice to make all the volumes equal 1.
