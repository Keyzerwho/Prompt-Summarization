 You are given two integers $n$ and $m$. Determine who wins if they both play optimally. It can be shown that the game is always finite, i.e. there always is a winning strategy for one of the players. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of numbers. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$). Furthermore, there are no pair of indices $i \neq j$ such that $a_i = a_j$. -----Output----- Print $s$ — a string of $n$ characters, where the $i$-th character represents the outcome of the game if the token is initially placed in the cell $i$. If Alice wins, then $s_i$ has to be equal to "A"; otherwise, $s_i$ has to be equal to "B".  -----Examples----- Input 8 3 6 5 4 2 7 1 8 Output BAAAABAB Input 15 3 11 2 5 10 9 7 13 15 8 4 12 6 1 14 Output ABAAAABBBAABAAB -----Note----- In the first sample, if Bob puts the token on the number (not position):   $1$: Alice can move to any number. She can win by picking $7$, from which Bob has no move.  $2$: Alice can move to $3$ and $5$. Upon moving to $5$, Bob can win by moving to $8$. If she chooses $3$ instead, she wins, as Bob has only a move to $4$, from which Alice can move to $8$.  $3$: Alice can only move to $4$, after which Bob wins by moving to $8$.  $4$, $5$, or $6$: Alice wins by moving to $8$.  $7$, $8$: Alice has no move, and hence she loses immediately.
