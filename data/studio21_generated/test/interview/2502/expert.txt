 You are given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine if the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the following condition is finite, and find the maximum value of such i if the number is finite.  - There exists a non-negative integer j such that the concatenation of i copies of t is a substring of the concatenation of j copies of s. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: s t -----Output----- If the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the following condition is finite, print the maximum value of such i; if the number is infinite, print -1. -----Sample Input----- abcabab ab -----Sample Output----- 3 The concatenation of three copies of t, ababab, is a substring of the concatenation of two copies of s, abcabababcabab, so i = 3 satisfies the condition. On the other hand, the concatenation of four copies of t, abababab, is not a substring of the concatenation of any number of copies of s, so i = 4 does not satisfy the condition. Similarly, any integer greater than 4 does not satisfy the condition, either. Thus, the number of non-negative integers i satisfying the condition is finite, and the maximum value of such i is 3.
