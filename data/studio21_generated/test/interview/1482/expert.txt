 You are given an array of integers. You are given k children. Each child wants exactly n orange segments. Return the number of segments each child will get. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 30). The second line contains k space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n·k), where a_{i} is the number of the orange segment that the i-th child would like to get. It is guaranteed that all numbers a_{i} are distinct. -----Output----- Print exactly n·k distinct integers. The first n integers represent the indexes of the segments the first child will get, the second n integers represent the indexes of the segments the second child will get, and so on. Separate the printed numbers with whitespaces. You can print a child's segment indexes in any order. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple correct answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 4 1 Output 2 4  1 3  Input 3 1 2 Output 3 2 1
