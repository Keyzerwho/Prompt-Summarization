 Given two arrays a, b find the smallest array that is lexicographically greater than a. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of elements in a and b. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (2 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5), the elements of a. -----Output----- Output n space-separated integers, the i-th of them representing b_{i}. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 5 4 13 Output 2 3 5 7 11  Input 3 10 3 7 Output 10 3 7  -----Note----- Note that in the second sample, the array is already pairwise coprime so we printed it.
