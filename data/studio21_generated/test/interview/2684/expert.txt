 you are given a word and you must find the longest subword of this word that is also a palindrome. 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the length of the word. The following line contains a single word of length $N$, made up of the letters a,b,â€¦, z. -----Output:----- The first line of the output must contain a single integer indicating the length of the longest subword of the given word that is a palindrome. The second line must contain a subword that is a palindrome and which of maximum length. If there is more than one subword palindrome of maximum length, it suffices to print out any one. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.  - You may assume that in $30 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq N \leq 300$. -----Sample Input 1:----- 5 abbba -----Sample Output 1:----- 5 abbba -----Sample Input 2:----- 12 abcbcabbacba -----Sample Output 2:----- 8 bcabbacb
