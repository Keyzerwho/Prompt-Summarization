 You are given n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} that denote the availability and the prices of the houses. If house i is occupied, and therefore cannot be bought, then a_{i} equals 0. Otherwise, house i can be bought, and a_{i} represents the money required to buy it, in dollars. As Zane has only k dollars to spare, it becomes a challenge for him to choose the house to purchase, so that he could live as near as possible to his crush. Help Zane determine the minimum distance from his crush's house to some house he can afford, to help him succeed in his love. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of houses in the village, the house where the girl lives, and the amount of money Zane has (in dollars), respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — denoting the availability and the prices of the houses. It is guaranteed that a_{m} = 0 and that it is possible to purchase some house with no more than k dollars. -----Output----- Print one integer — the minimum distance, in meters, from the house where the girl Zane likes lives to the house Zane can buy. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 20 0 27 32 21 19 Output 40 Input 7 3 50 62 0 0 0 99 33 22 Output 30 Input 10 5 100 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 Output 20 -----Note----- In the first sample, with k = 20 dollars, Zane can buy only house 5. The distance from house m = 1 to house 5 is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 meters. In the second sample, Zane can buy houses 6 and 7. It is better to buy house 6 than house 7, since house m = 3 and house 6 are only 30 meters away, while house m = 3 and house 7 are 40 meters away.
