 You are given an integer T seconds. You need to print the number of times Lesha will start the song. 
-----Input----- The single line contains three integers T, S, q (2 ≤ q ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ S < T ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of times the song will be restarted. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 2 Output 2 Input 5 4 7 Output 1 Input 6 2 3 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first test, the song is played twice faster than it is downloaded, which means that during four first seconds Lesha reaches the moment that has not been downloaded, and starts the song again. After another two seconds, the song is downloaded completely, and thus, Lesha starts the song twice. In the second test, the song is almost downloaded, and Lesha will start it only once. In the third sample test the download finishes and Lesha finishes listening at the same moment. Note that song isn't restarted in this case.
