 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The first input line contains integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 100) — the number of integers. The second line contains k distinct space-separated integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_{k} (0 ≤ d_{i} ≤ 100). -----Output----- In the first line print a single integer n the maximum number of the chosen integers. In the second line print n distinct non-negative integers — the required integers. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. You can print the numbers in any order. -----Examples----- Input 4 100 10 1 0 Output 4 0 1 10 100  Input 3 2 70 3 Output 2 2 70
