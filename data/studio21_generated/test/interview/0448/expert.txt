 You are given a list of $n$ integers. For each integer $i$, return $i$ if $i$ is odd and $i+1$ if $i$ is even. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ m ≤ 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100). -----Output----- Output a single integer, representing the number of the last child. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 1 3 1 4 2 Output 4 Input 6 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 Output 6 -----Note----- Let's consider the first sample.  Firstly child 1 gets 2 candies and go home. Then child 2 gets 2 candies and go to the end of the line. Currently the line looks like [3, 4, 5, 2] (indices of the children in order of the line). Then child 3 gets 2 candies and go home, and then child 4 gets 2 candies and goes to the end of the line. Currently the line looks like [5, 2, 4]. Then child 5 gets 2 candies and goes home. Then child 2 gets two candies and goes home, and finally child 4 gets 2 candies and goes home. Child 4 is the last one who goes home.
