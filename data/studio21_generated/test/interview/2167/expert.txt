 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the array size. The second line contains space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (|a_{i}| ≤ 10^4) — the original array. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of equal array elements he can get if he performs an arbitrary number of the given operation. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 1 Output 1 Input 3 1 4 1 Output 3
