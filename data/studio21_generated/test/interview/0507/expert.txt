 you are given a list of integers. Construct all possible permutations of integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is the length of the list, and for each permutation, print its elements. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the length of Sengoku's permutation, being the length of both meteor outbursts at the same time. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n) — the sequence of colours in the first meteor outburst. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (1 ≤ b_{i} ≤ n) — the sequence of colours in the second meteor outburst. At least one i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) exists, such that a_{i} ≠ b_{i} holds. -----Output----- Output n space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, denoting a possible permutation Sengoku could have had. If there are more than one possible answer, output any one of them. Input guarantees that such permutation exists. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 3 1 2 5 4 5 Output 1 2 5 4 3 Input 5 4 4 2 3 1 5 4 5 3 1 Output 5 4 2 3 1 Input 4 1 1 3 4 1 4 3 4 Output 1 2 3 4 -----Note----- In the first sample, both 1, 2, 5, 4, 3 and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are acceptable outputs. In the second sample, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1 is the only permutation to satisfy the constraints.
