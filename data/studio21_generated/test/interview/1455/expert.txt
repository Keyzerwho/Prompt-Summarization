 You are given $n$ chess pieces numbered from $1$ to $n$.  You need to find the smallest chessboard on which you can put them according to the rules. 
-----Input----- The only line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 1000$) — the number of chess pieces for the game. -----Output----- The first line contains a single integer — the minimum value of $m$, where $m$ is the length of sides of the suitable chessboard. The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $r_i$ and $c_i$ ($1\le r_i,c_i\le m$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th chess piece. If there are multiple answers, print any. -----Examples----- Input 2 Output 2 1 1 1 2 Input 4 Output 3 1 1 1 3 3 1 3 3 -----Note----- In the first example, you can't place the two pieces on a $1\times1$ chessboard without breaking the rule. But you can place two pieces on a $2\times2$ chessboard like this: [Image] In the second example, you can't place four pieces on a $2\times2$ chessboard without breaking the rule. For example, if you place the pieces like this: [Image] then $|r_1-r_3|+|c_1-c_3|=|1-2|+|1-1|=1$, $|1-3|=2$, $1<2$; and $|r_1-r_4|+|c_1-c_4|=|1-2|+|1-2|=2$, $|1-4|=3$, $2<3$. It doesn't satisfy the rule. However, on a $3\times3$ chessboard, you can place four pieces like this: [Image]
