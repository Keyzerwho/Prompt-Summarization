 You are given a graph. Find the maximum independent set.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The next line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- Output a single integer — the answer to the problem.  -----Examples----- Input 3 3 1 2 Output 2 -----Note----- Consider the first example. Bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 1. We add edge (1, 3). Permutation is now [1, 3, 2]. Then bubble sort swaps elements 3 and 2. We add edge (2, 3). Permutation is now sorted. We have a graph with 3 vertices and 2 edges (1, 3) and (2, 3). Its maximal independent set is [1, 2].
