 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the minimum time required to solve a 3x3x3 cube. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with four real numbers $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ and $t_4$, the times Claire got on her first four solves.  - One line with a real number $t$, Claire’s target final score, the worst final score she can have in order to be declared the overall winner. Each number is between $1$ and $20$, inclusive, and is given with exactly two decimal places. -----Output----- If it is not possible for Claire to win the event, output “impossible”. If she will win regardless of the time she gets on her last solve, output “infinite”. Otherwise, output the worst time she can have on her last solve in order to be declared the overall winner. Output the number to exactly two decimal places. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6.38 7.20 6.95 8.11 7.53 Sample Output 1: infinite Sample Input 2: 6.38 7.20 6.95 8.11 6.99 Sample Output 2: 6.82
