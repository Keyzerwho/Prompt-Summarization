 You are given a photo. You need to decide whether this photo contains a zebra or not. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the width of the photo. The second line contains a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1) — the description of the photo. If a_{i} is zero, the i-th column is all black. If a_{i} is one, then the i-th column is all white. -----Output----- If the photo can be a photo of zebra, print "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 9 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 Output YES Input 7 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 Output NO Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output YES Input 8 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 Output NO Input 9 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 Output NO -----Note----- The first two examples are described in the statements. In the third example all pixels are white, so the photo can be a photo of zebra. In the fourth example the width of the first stripe is equal to three (white color), the width of the second stripe is equal to three (black), and the width of the third stripe is equal to two (white). Thus, not all stripes have equal length, so this photo is not a photo of zebra.
