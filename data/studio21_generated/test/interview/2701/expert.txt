 You are given an array of integers. You should take two elements from this array such that sum of their types should be equal to K. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers N and K, denoting the number of apples and the required sum respectively. Then the next line contains N space-separated integers T1, T2, ..., TN, denoting the types of the apples. -----Output----- Print one integer describing the minimum number of seconds that Chef needs to wait till he gets the desired apples. If Chef cannot get the desired apples, then output "-1" without quotes. -----Constraints----- - 2 ≤ N ≤ 500000 (5 × 105) - 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000000 (106) - 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000000 (106) -----Example----- Sample Input 1: 5 5 2 4 3 2 1 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 5 5 2 4 9 2 5 Sample Output 2: -1 -----Explanation----- In the first example, if Chef leaves the first dog from left and gives it integer 4, and the second dog from right and gives it integer 1, then the first dog takes 2 seconds and the second dog takes 1 second to get the apples. Thus Chef needs to wait 2 seconds. In any other way, Chef can't get the desired apples in less than 2 seconds. In the second example, Chef cannot get two apples such that the sum of their types is 5 so the answer is "-1".
