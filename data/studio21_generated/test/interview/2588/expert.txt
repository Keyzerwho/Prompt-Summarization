 You are given a binary string describing a road. The string consists of $n$ characters. Each character describes an interval of the road. A character equal to 0 means that interval doesn't contain a crossroad, and 1 means that there is a crossroad. You are also given the cost of pipe and the cost of pillars. You need to find the shape of the pipeline with minimum possible cost and calculate that cost. 
-----Input----- The fist line contains one integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of queries. Next $2 \cdot T$ lines contain independent queries — one query per two lines. The first line contains three integers $n$, $a$, $b$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le a \le 10^8$, $1 \le b \le 10^8$) — the length of the road, the cost of one unit of the pipeline and the cost of one unit of the pillar, respectively. The second line contains binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{0, 1\}$, $s_1 = s_n = 0$) — the description of the road. It's guaranteed that the total length of all strings $s$ doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- Print $T$ integers — one per query. For each query print the minimum possible cost of the constructed pipeline. -----Example----- Input 4 8 2 5 00110010 8 1 1 00110010 9 100000000 100000000 010101010 2 5 1 00 Output 94 25 2900000000 13 -----Note----- The optimal pipeline for the first query is shown at the picture above.
