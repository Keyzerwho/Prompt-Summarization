 You are given an array with numbers. Find the minimum possible number of rooms in Paris catacombs according to Petya's logbook
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — then number of notes in Petya's logbook. The second line contains n non-negative integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (0 ≤ t_{i} < i) — notes in the logbook. -----Output----- In the only line print a single integer — the minimum possible number of rooms in Paris catacombs. -----Examples----- Input 2 0 0 Output 2 Input 5 0 1 0 1 3 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample, sequence of rooms Petya visited could be, for example 1 → 1 → 2, 1 → 2 → 1 or 1 → 2 → 3. The minimum possible number of rooms is 2. In the second sample, the sequence could be 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 → 2 → 1.
