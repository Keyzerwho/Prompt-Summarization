 You are given an array of heights. You need to make supports nondecreasing in height. 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of supports Omkar has. The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}$ $(0 \leq a_{i} \leq 10^9)$ — the heights of the supports. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations Omkar needs to perform to make his supports able to support his waterslide. -----Example----- Input 3 4 5 3 2 5 5 1 2 3 5 3 3 1 1 1 Output 3 2 0 -----Note----- The subarray with which Omkar performs the operation is bolded. In the first test case: First operation: $[5, 3, \textbf{2}, 5] \to [5, 3, \textbf{3}, 5]$ Second operation: $[5, \textbf{3}, \textbf{3}, 5] \to [5, \textbf{4}, \textbf{4}, 5]$ Third operation: $[5, \textbf{4}, \textbf{4}, 5] \to [5, \textbf{5}, \textbf{5}, 5]$ In the third test case, the array is already nondecreasing, so Omkar does $0$ operations.
