 You are given an integer n and a number k such that gcd(n, k) = 1. You are also given a list of vertices numbered from 1 to n. For each vertex, you need to return the number of sections after each operation. 
-----Input----- There are only two numbers in the input: n and k (5 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 2, gcd(n, k) = 1). -----Output----- You should print n values separated by spaces. The i-th value should represent number of polygon's sections after drawing first i lines. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 Output 2 3 5 8 11  Input 10 3 Output 2 3 4 6 9 12 16 21 26 31  -----Note----- The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without a remainder. For the first sample testcase, you should output "2 3 5 8 11". Pictures below correspond to situations after drawing lines. [Image] [Image] [Image] [Image] [Image] [Image]
