 There are N dots in a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th dot are (x_i, y_i). We will repeat the following operation as long as possible:  - Choose four integers a, b, c, d (a ≠ c, b ≠ d) such that there are dots at exactly three of the positions (a, b), (a, d), (c, b) and (c, d), and add a dot at the remaining position. We can prove that we can only do this operation a finite number of times. Find the maximum number of times we can do the operation. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N x_1 y_1 : x_N y_N -----Output----- Print the maximum number of times we can do the operation. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 1 5 1 5 5 -----Sample Output----- 1 By choosing a = 1, b = 1, c = 5, d = 5, we can add a dot at (1, 5). We cannot do the operation any more, so the maximum number of operations is 1.
