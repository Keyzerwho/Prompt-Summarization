 You are given a program that consists of $n$ lines. Your task is to write a program consisting of minimum possible number of lines that is equivalent to the program you are given. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of lines in the program. Then $n$ lines follow — the program itself. Each line corresponds to the format described in the statement and has no extra whitespaces. -----Output----- In the first line print $k$ — the minimum number of lines in the equivalent program. Then print $k$ lines without any whitespaces — an equivalent program having exactly $k$ lines, in the same format it is described in the statement. -----Examples----- Input 4 c=aa#bb d12=c res=c^d12 tmp=aa$c Output 2 aaaa=aa#bb res=aaaa^aaaa Input 2 max=aaaa$bbbb min=bbbb^aaaa Output 0
