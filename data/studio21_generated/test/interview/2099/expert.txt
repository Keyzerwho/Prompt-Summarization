 You are given an array with user IDs, and for each user ID, you need to count the number of distinct users online. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers n, M and T (1 ≤ n, M ≤ 20 000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 86400) — the number of queries, the record number of online users and the time when the user was online after a query was sent. Next n lines contain the times of the queries in the format "hh:mm:ss", where hh are hours, mm are minutes, ss are seconds. The times of the queries follow in the non-decreasing order, some of them can coincide. It is guaranteed that all the times and even all the segments of type [s, s + T - 1] are within one 24-hour range (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59).  -----Output----- In the first line print number R — the largest possible number of distinct users. The following n lines should contain the user IDs for requests in the same order in which the requests are given in the input. User IDs must be integers from 1 to R. The requests of the same user must correspond to the same identifiers, the requests of distinct users must correspond to distinct identifiers. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If there is no solution, print "No solution" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 4 2 10 17:05:53 17:05:58 17:06:01 22:39:47 Output 3 1 2 2 3 Input 1 2 86400 00:00:00 Output No solution -----Note----- Consider the first sample. The user who sent the first request was online from 17:05:53 to 17:06:02, the user who sent the second request was online from 17:05:58 to 17:06:07, the user who sent the third request, was online from 17:06:01 to 17:06:10. Thus, these IDs cannot belong to three distinct users, because in that case all these users would be online, for example, at 17:06:01. That is impossible, because M = 2. That means that some two of these queries belonged to the same user. One of the correct variants is given in the answer to the sample. For it user 1 was online from 17:05:53 to 17:06:02, user 2 — from 17:05:58 to 17:06:10 (he sent the second and third queries), user 3 — from 22:39:47 to 22:39:56. In the second sample there is only one query. So, only one user visited the network within the 24-hour period and there couldn't be two users online on the network simultaneously. (The time the user spent online is the union of time intervals for requests, so users who didn't send requests could not be online in the network.)
