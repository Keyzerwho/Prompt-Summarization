 You are given an array of integers, each between 1 and N.  Sort the array using turbosort.  Find the number of swaps in each phase of the algorithm. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100000$), the number of elements in the array. Each of the following $N$ lines contains an integer between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive), the array to be sorted. The array will contain no duplicates. -----Output----- For each of the $N$ phases, output the number of swaps on a single line. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 1 3 Sample Output 1: 1 0 0 Sample Input 2: 5 5 4 3 2 1 Sample Output 2: 4 3 2 1 0
