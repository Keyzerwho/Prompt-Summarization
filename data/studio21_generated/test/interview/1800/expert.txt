 You are given n different commodities and r_i is the number of the i-th manager. The managers can reorder the elements in some order. You are asked to speed up the process and determine how the final report will look like. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200 000) — the number of commodities in the report and the number of managers, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (|a_{i}| ≤ 10^9) — the initial report before it gets to the first manager. Then follow m lines with the descriptions of the operations managers are going to perform. The i-th of these lines contains two integers t_{i} and r_{i} ($t_{i} \in \{1,2 \}$, 1 ≤ r_{i} ≤ n), meaning that the i-th manager sorts the first r_{i} numbers either in the non-descending (if t_{i} = 1) or non-ascending (if t_{i} = 2) order. -----Output----- Print n integers — the final report, which will be passed to Blake by manager number m. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 2 3 2 2 Output 2 1 3  Input 4 2 1 2 4 3 2 3 1 2 Output 2 4 1 3  -----Note----- In the first sample, the initial report looked like: 1 2 3. After the first manager the first two numbers were transposed: 2 1 3. The report got to Blake in this form. In the second sample the original report was like this: 1 2 4 3. After the first manager the report changed to: 4 2 1 3. After the second manager the report changed to: 2 4 1 3. This report was handed over to Blake.
