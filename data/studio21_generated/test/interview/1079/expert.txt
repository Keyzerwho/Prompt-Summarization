 You are given $n$ integers. Find the number of decompositions which use the least number of beautiful numbers. 
-----Input----- The first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6), that is the binary representation of number n without leading zeroes (n > 0). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum amount of beautiful numbers that give a total of n. -----Examples----- Input 10 Output 1 Input 111 Output 2 Input 1101101 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample n = 2 is a beautiful number. In the second sample n = 7 and Valera can decompose it into sum 2^3 + ( - 2^0). In the third sample n = 109 can be decomposed into the sum of four summands as follows: 2^7 + ( - 2^4) + ( - 2^2) + 2^0.
