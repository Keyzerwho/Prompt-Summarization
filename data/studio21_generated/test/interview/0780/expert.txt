 Suppose you have a special $x$-$y$-counter. This counter can store some value as a decimal number; at first, the counter has value $0$.  The counter performs the following algorithm: it prints its lowest digit and, after that, adds either $x$ or $y$ to its value. So all sequences this counter generates are starting from $0$. For example, a $4$-$2$-counter can act as follows:  it prints $0$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $4$, and the output is $0$;  it prints $4$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $8$, and the output is $04$;  it prints $8$, and adds $4$ to its value, so the current value is $12$, and the output is $048$;  it prints $2$, and adds $2$ to its value, so the current value is $14$, and the output is $0482$;  it prints $4$, and adds $4
-----Input----- The first line contains a single string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^6$, $s_i \in \{\text{0} - \text{9}\}$) â€” the remaining data you have. It's guaranteed that $s_1 = 0$. -----Output----- Print a $10 \times 10$ matrix, where the $j$-th integer ($0$-indexed) on the $i$-th line ($0$-indexed too) is equal to the minimum number of digits you have to insert in the string $s$ to make it a possible output of the $i$-$j$-counter, or $-1$ if there is no way to do so. -----Example----- Input 0840 Output -1 17 7 7 7 -1 2 17 2 7  17 17 7 5 5 5 2 7 2 7  7 7 7 4 3 7 1 7 2 5  7 5 4 7 3 3 2 5 2 3  7 5 3 3 7 7 1 7 2 7  -1 5 7 3 7 -1 2 9 2 7  2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 0 1  17 7 7 5 7 9 2 17 2 3  2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2  7 7 5 3 7 7 1 3 2 7  -----Note----- Let's take, for example, $4$-$3$-counter. One of the possible outcomes the counter could print is $0(4)8(1)4(7)0$ (lost elements are in the brackets). One of the possible outcomes a $2$-$3$-counter could print is $0(35)8(1)4(7)0$. The $6$-$8$-counter could print exactly the string $0840$.
