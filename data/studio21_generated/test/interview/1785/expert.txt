 You are given a positive integer `n`. You are asked to find the number of strings t such that $\rho(s, t) = \operatorname{max}_{u :|u|=|s|} \rho(s, u)$. As the answer may be very large, count the number of such strings modulo 10^9 + 7.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line of the input contains a single string of length n, consisting of characters "ACGT". -----Output----- Print a single number — the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 1 C Output 1 Input 2 AG Output 4 Input 3 TTT Output 1 -----Note----- Please note that if for two distinct strings t_1 and t_2 values ρ(s, t_1) и ρ(s, t_2) are maximum among all possible t, then both strings must be taken into account in the answer even if one of them can be obtained by a circular shift of another one. In the first sample, there is ρ("C", "C") = 1, for the remaining strings t of length 1 the value of ρ(s, t) is 0. In the second sample, ρ("AG", "AG") = ρ("AG", "GA") = ρ("AG", "AA") = ρ("AG", "GG") = 4. In the third sample, ρ("TTT", "TTT") = 27
