 You are given an array of n integers, needed by no one. You need to find the minimum value that the product of all array elements (i.e. $\prod_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i}$) can reach, if Maxim would apply no more than k operations to it. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers n, k and x (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 200 000, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) — the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of operations and the number invented by Maxim, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ($|a_{i}|\leq 10^{9}$) — the elements of the array found by Maxim. -----Output----- Print n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} in the only line — the array elements after applying no more than k operations to the array. In particular, $a_{i} \equiv b_{i} \operatorname{mod} x$ should stay true for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n, but the product of all array elements should be minimum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 1 5 4 3 5 2 Output 5 4 3 5 -1  Input 5 3 1 5 4 3 5 5 Output 5 4 0 5 5  Input 5 3 1 5 4 4 5 5 Output 5 1 4 5 5  Input 3 2 7 5 4 2 Output 5 11 -5
