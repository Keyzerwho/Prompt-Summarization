 You are given two integers h_1 and h_2. You should construct an array such that, the caterpillar gets the apple in at most h_2 days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers h_1, h_2 (1 ≤ h_1 < h_2 ≤ 10^5) — the heights of the position of the caterpillar and the apple in centimeters. The second line contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5) — the distance the caterpillar goes up by day and slips down by night, in centimeters per hour. -----Output----- Print the only integer k — the number of days Gabriel should wait to return to the forest and see the caterpillar getting the apple. If the caterpillar can't get the apple print the only integer  - 1. -----Examples----- Input 10 30 2 1 Output 1 Input 10 13 1 1 Output 0 Input 10 19 1 2 Output -1 Input 1 50 5 4 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first example at 10 pm of the first day the caterpillar gets the height 26. At 10 am of the next day it slips down to the height 14. And finally at 6 pm of the same day the caterpillar gets the apple. Note that in the last example the caterpillar was slipping down under the ground and getting the apple on the next day.
