 Given an array of doors with n doors, each door has two states (open or closed). Return the minimum number of seconds, in which all the cupboard doors can be in the required position. 
-----Input----- The first input line contains a single integer n — the number of cupboards in the kitchen (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). Then follow n lines, each containing two integers l_{i} and r_{i} (0 ≤ l_{i}, r_{i} ≤ 1). Number l_{i} equals one, if the left door of the i-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number l_{i} equals zero. Similarly, number r_{i} equals one, if the right door of the i-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number r_{i} equals zero. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- In the only output line print a single integer t — the minimum number of seconds Karlsson needs to change the doors of all cupboards to the position he needs. -----Examples----- Input 5 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 Output 3
