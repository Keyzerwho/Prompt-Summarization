 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizontal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Help Pasha distribute all the apples between the entities. Note that Pasha wants to distribute all the apples, not just some of them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integers n, a, b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100; 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n) — the number of apples Pasha has, the number of apples Arthur likes and the number of apples Alexander likes, correspondingly. The next line contains a distinct integers — the numbers of the apples Arthur likes. The next line contains b distinct integers — the numbers of the apples Alexander likes. Assume that the apples are numbered from 1 to n. The input is such that the answer exists. -----Output----- Print n characters, each of them equals either 1 or 2. If the i-h character equals 1, then the i-th apple should be given to Arthur, otherwise it should be given to Alexander. If there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 3 1 2 2 3 4 Output 1 1 2 2 Input 5 5 2 3 4 1 2 5 2 3 Output 1 1 1 1 1
