 You are given n students. Each student can get 1, 2, or 3 diplomas. You need to choose an option of distributing diplomas such that all students get at least one diploma. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^6) — the number of schoolchildren who will participate in the Olympiad. The next line of the input contains two integers min_1 and max_1 (1 ≤ min_1 ≤ max_1 ≤ 10^6) — the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the first degree that can be distributed. The third line of the input contains two integers min_2 and max_2 (1 ≤ min_2 ≤ max_2 ≤ 10^6) — the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the second degree that can be distributed.  The next line of the input contains two integers min_3 and max_3 (1 ≤ min_3 ≤ max_3 ≤ 10^6) — the minimum and maximum limits on the number of diplomas of the third degree that can be distributed.  It is guaranteed that min_1 + min_2 + min_3 ≤ n ≤ max_1 + max_2 + max_3. -----Output----- In the first line of the output print three numbers, showing how many diplomas of the first, second and third degree will be given to students in the optimal variant of distributing diplomas. The optimal variant of distributing diplomas is the one that maximizes the number of students who receive diplomas of the first degree. Of all the suitable options, the best one is the one which maximizes the number of participants who receive diplomas of the second degree. If there are several of these options, the best one is the one that maximizes the number of diplomas of the third degree. -----Examples----- Input 6 1 5 2 6 3 7 Output 1 2 3  Input 10 1 2 1 3 1 5 Output 2 3 5  Input 6 1 3 2 2 2 2 Output 2 2 2
