 Given a set of intervals I, and a set of integers S, you need to compute the size of the smallest set S that covers it.
-----Input format----- The first line contains a single integer N, giving the number of intervals in the input. This is followed by N lines, each containing two integers separated by a space describing an interval, with the first integer guaranteed to be less than or equal to the second integer. -----Output format----- Output a single integer giving the size of the smallest set of integers that covers the given set of intervals. -----Test data----- You may assume that all integers in the input are in the range 1 to 10^8 inclusive. Subtask 1 (100 marks) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 5000. -----Sample Input 1----- 2  3 5  3 3 -----Sample Output 1----- 1 -----Sample Input 2----- 3  6 9  3 5  4 8 -----Sample Output 2----- 2
