 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 A_2 A_3 ... A_{N} -----Output----- Print the answer. -----Sample Input----- 5 1 2 1 3 7 -----Sample Output----- 3 One optimal solution is to perform the operation once, taking out two cards with 1 and one card with 2. One card with 1 and another with 2 will be eaten, and the remaining card with 1 will be returned to deck. Then, the values written on the remaining cards in the deck will be pairwise distinct: 1, 3 and 7.
