 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer t (0 < t < 180) — the number of tests. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer a (0 < a < 180) — the angle the robot can make corners at measured in degrees. -----Output----- For each test, output on a single line "YES" (without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and "NO" (without quotes), if it is impossible. -----Examples----- Input 3 30 60 90 Output NO YES YES -----Note----- In the first test case, it is impossible to build the fence, since there is no regular polygon with angle $30^{\circ}$. In the second test case, the fence is a regular triangle, and in the last test case — a square.
