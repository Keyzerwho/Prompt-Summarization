 You are given a square and its color. You are allowed to move pieces but not allowed to rotate or flip them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains odd integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the size of all pieces of the board.  Then 4 segments follow, each describes one piece of the board. Each consists of n lines of n characters; j-th one of i-th line is equal to 1 if the square is black initially and 0 otherwise. Segments are separated by an empty line. -----Output----- Print one number — minimum number of squares Magnus should recolor to be able to obtain a valid chessboard. -----Examples----- Input 1 0 0 1 0 Output 1 Input 3 101 010 101 101 000 101 010 101 011 010 101 010 Output 2
