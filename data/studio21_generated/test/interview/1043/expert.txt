 You are given $n$ boxers with different strength from 1 to $n$, and $n$ dollars. You need to find minimum number of dollars you have to spend to make your friend win the tournament, provided that you arrange the boxers into pairs during each stage as you wish. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2^{18}$) — the number of boxers. $n$ is a power of $2$. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$, where $a_i$ is the number of dollars you have to pay if you want to bribe the boxer with strength $i$. Exactly one of $a_i$ is equal to $-1$ — it means that the boxer with strength $i$ is your friend. All other values are in the range $[1, 10^9]$. -----Output----- Print one integer — the minimum number of dollars you have to pay so your friend wins. -----Examples----- Input 4 3 9 1 -1 Output 0 Input 8 11 -1 13 19 24 7 17 5 Output 12 -----Note----- In the first test case no matter how you will distribute boxers into pairs, your friend is the strongest boxer and anyway wins the tournament. In the second test case you can distribute boxers as follows (your friend is number $2$): $1 : 2, 8 : 5, 7 : 3, 6 : 4$ (boxers $2, 8, 7$ and $6$ advance to the next stage); $2 : 6, 8 : 7$ (boxers $2$ and $8$ advance to the next stage, you have to bribe the boxer with strength $6$); $2 : 8$ (you have to bribe the boxer with strength $8$);
