 You are given a number N and permutation p_1,p_2,...,p_N consisting of 1,2,..,N. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Operation: Swap two adjacent elements in the permutation. You want to have p_i   i for all 1 i N. Find the minimum required number of operations to achieve this. 
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N p_1 p_2 .. p_N -----Output----- Print the minimum required number of operations -----Sample Input----- 5 1 4 3 5 2 -----Sample Output----- 2 Swap 1 and 4, then swap 1 and 3. p is now 4,3,1,5,2 and satisfies the condition. This is the minimum possible number, so the answer is 2.
