 Given an integer $n$, perform zero or more operations, where each operation is either multiplying $n$ by $x$, or replacing $n$ with $\sqrt{n}$. Return the minimum value of $n$ that can be achieved, and the minimum operations required to achieve that minimum value. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — the initial number. -----Output----- Print two integers: the minimum integer $n$ that can be achieved using the described operations and the minimum number of operations required. -----Examples----- Input 20 Output 10 2 Input 5184 Output 6 4 -----Note----- In the first example, you can apply the operation mul $5$ to get $100$ and then sqrt to get $10$. In the second example, you can first apply sqrt to get $72$, then mul $18$ to get $1296$ and finally two more sqrt and you get $6$. Note, that even if the initial value of $n$ is less or equal $10^6$, it can still become greater than $10^6$ after applying one or more operations.
