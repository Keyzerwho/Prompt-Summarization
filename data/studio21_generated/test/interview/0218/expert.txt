 
-----Input----- The first line contains three positive integers n, p, q (1 ≤ p, q ≤ n ≤ 100). The second line contains the string s consists of lowercase and uppercase latin letters and digits. -----Output----- If it's impossible to split the string s to the strings of length p and q print the only number "-1". Otherwise in the first line print integer k — the number of strings in partition of s. Each of the next k lines should contain the strings in partition. Each string should be of the length p or q. The string should be in order of their appearing in string s — from left to right. If there are several solutions print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 Hello Output 2 He llo Input 10 9 5 Codeforces Output 2 Codef orces Input 6 4 5 Privet Output -1 Input 8 1 1 abacabac Output 8 a b a c a b a c
