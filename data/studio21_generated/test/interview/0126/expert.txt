 You are given a sequence of vectors. For each vector, you need to compute the number of keys that were pressed consecutively to put in the number. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) — the number of digits in the phone number that Mike put in. The second line contains the string consisting of n digits (characters from '0' to '9') representing the number that Mike put in. -----Output----- If there is no other phone number with the same finger movements and Mike can be sure he is calling the correct number, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line. Otherwise print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. -----Examples----- Input 3 586 Output NO Input 2 09 Output NO Input 9 123456789 Output YES Input 3 911 Output YES -----Note----- You can find the picture clarifying the first sample case in the statement above.
