 You are given a number $n$ and a number $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$, if the number is divisible by $m$, you store the length of the segment. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their lengths are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer $n$ specifying the number of plotted points. The following $n$ lines each contain a pair of space-separated integer coordinates indicating one plotted point. Each coordinate is non-negative and less than $2^{31}$. There are at most $10^{5}$ points, all of them are distinct. In this problem, all coordinates and distances are expressed in plotter length units, the length of the unit in the x-direction and in the y-direction is the same. -----Output----- The output contains a single integer equal to the number of pairs of points which are exactly $2018$ length units apart. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 20180000 20180000 20180000 20182018 20182018 20180000 20182018 20182018 Sample Output: 4
