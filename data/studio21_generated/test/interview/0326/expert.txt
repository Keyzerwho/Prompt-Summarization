 Takahashi wants to make a string that is a palindrome. The cost of using the string S_i once is C_i, and the cost of using it multiple times is C_i multiplied by that number of times. Find the minimum total cost needed to choose strings so that Takahashi can make a palindrome. If there is no choice of strings in which he can make a palindrome, print -1.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N S_1 C_1 S_2 C_2 : S_N C_N -----Output----- Print the minimum total cost needed to choose strings so that Takahashi can make a palindrome, or -1 if there is no such choice. -----Sample Input----- 3 ba 3 abc 4 cbaa 5 -----Sample Output----- 7 We have ba, abc, and cbaa. For example, we can use ba once and abc once for a cost of 7, then concatenate them in the order abc, ba to make a palindrome. Also, we can use abc once and cbaa once for a cost of 9, then concatenate them in the order cbaa, abc to make a palindrome. We cannot make a palindrome for a cost less than 7, so we should print 7.
