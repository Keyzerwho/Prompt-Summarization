 You are given two numbers $a$ and $b$. You are also given two programs, one for Alice and one for Bob. Your task is to predict how many points Alice and Bob will have after k games. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three numbers k, a, b (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 3).  Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers A_{i}, 1, A_{i}, 2, A_{i}, 3, where A_{i}, j represents Alice's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ A_{i}, j ≤ 3).  Then 3 lines follow, i-th of them containing 3 numbers B_{i}, 1, B_{i}, 2, B_{i}, 3, where B_{i}, j represents Bob's choice in the game if Alice chose i in previous game and Bob chose j (1 ≤ B_{i}, j ≤ 3).  -----Output----- Print two numbers. First of them has to be equal to the number of points Alice will have, and second of them must be Bob's score after k games. -----Examples----- Input 10 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Output 1 9 Input 8 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 Output 5 2 Input 5 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Output 0 0 -----Note----- In the second example game goes like this: $(1,1) \rightarrow(2,1) \rightarrow(3,2) \rightarrow(1,2) \rightarrow(2,1) \rightarrow(3,2) \rightarrow(1,2) \rightarrow(2,1)$ The fourth and the seventh game are won by Bob, the first game is draw and the rest are won by Alice.
