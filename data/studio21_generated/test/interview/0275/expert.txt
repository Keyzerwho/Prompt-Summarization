 You are given two numbers written in golden system notation. You need to determine which of them has larger decimal value. 
-----Input----- Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000. -----Output----- Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal. -----Examples----- Input 1000 111 Output < Input 00100 11 Output = Input 110 101 Output > -----Note----- In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number. In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
