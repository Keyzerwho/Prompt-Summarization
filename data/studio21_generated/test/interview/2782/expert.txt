 You are given $n$ passengers, $r$ rows and $c$ seats. You need to find an assignment which takes into account how far the passengers accepts to sit from their assigned seats so that as many passengers as possible get a seat. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with the integers $n$, $r$ and $c$ ($1 \le n, r, c \le 10^5$), the number of passengers, rows and columns in the flight.  - $n$ lines with the integers $a_ i, b_ i$ and $s_ i$ ($1 \le a_ i \le r$, $1 \le b_ i \le c$, $0 \le s_ i \le r$). The $i$’th line has the assigned row $a_ i$ and column $b_ i$, and maximum distance $s_ i$ of the $i$’th passenger. The maximum distance is given in rows. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of passengers that can be assigned a seat in an optimal assignment. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 3 3 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 2 Sample Output 2: 3
