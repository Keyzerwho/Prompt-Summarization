 You are given an array of integers. You need to find $k$ flowers that can be removed without causing machine to create less than $n$ workpieces. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers $m$, $k$, $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n, k, m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$, $k \cdot n \le m$, $1 \le s \le k$): the number of flowers on the liana, the number of flowers in one wreath, the amount of citizens and the length of Diana's flower sequence respectively. The second line contains $m$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_m$ ($1 \le a_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)  — types of flowers on the liana. The third line contains $s$ integers $b_1$, $b_2$, ..., $b_s$ ($1 \le b_i \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)  — the sequence in Diana's schematic. -----Output----- If it's impossible to remove some of the flowers so that there would be at least $n$ workpieces and at least one of them fullfills Diana's schematic requirements, output $-1$. Otherwise in the first line output one integer $d$  — the number of flowers to be removed by Diana. In the next line output $d$ different integers  — the positions of the flowers to be removed. If there are multiple answers, print any. -----Examples----- Input 7 3 2 2 1 2 3 3 2 1 2 2 2 Output 1 4  Input 13 4 3 3 3 2 6 4 1 4 4 7 1 3 3 2 4 4 3 4 Output -1 Input 13 4 1 3 3 2 6 4 1 4 4 7 1 3 3 2 4 4 3 4 Output 9 1 2 3 4 5 9 11 12 13 -----Note----- In the first example, if you don't remove any flowers, the machine would put out two workpieces with flower types $[1, 2, 3]$ and $[3, 2, 1]$. Those workpieces don't fit Diana's schematic. But if you remove flower on $4$-th place, the machine would output workpieces $[1, 2, 3]$ and $[2, 1, 2]$. The second workpiece fits Diana's schematic. In the second example there is no way to remove flowers so that every citizen gets a wreath and Diana gets a workpiece that fits here schematic. In the third example Diana is the only citizen of the town and that means she can, for example, just remove all flowers except the ones she needs.
