 You are given two DNA sequences (each in 2^n characters). You need to output the length of the smallest single, consecutive piece of DNA that can have been inserted into the first sequence to turn it into the second one. Small changes in the DNA can have large effects, so the virus might insert only a few bases, or even nothing at all. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two lines containing the DNA sequence before and after virus infection respectively. A DNA sequence is given as a string containing between 1 and $10^5$ upper-case letters from the alphabet {A, G, C, T}. -----Output----- Output one integer, the minimum length of DNA inserted by the virus. -----Examples----- Sample Input: AAAAA AGCGAA Sample Output: 3
