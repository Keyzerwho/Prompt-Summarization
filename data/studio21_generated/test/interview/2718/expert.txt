 You are given two stacks of blocks. Remove some number of blocks from the stack which contains the largest number of blocks. 
-----Input----- One line with two integers $N$ and $M$, satisfying $1 \leq N, M\leq 10^{18}$, the initial sizes of the two stacks of blocks. -----Output----- Output a single line containing a single word: the word “win” if you are guaranteed to win if you play correctly, and the word “lose” if your opponent can force you to lose. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 Sample Output 1: lose Sample Input 2: 3 3 Sample Output 2: win Sample Input 3: 5 2 Sample Output 3: win Sample Input 4: 5 3 Sample Output 4: win
