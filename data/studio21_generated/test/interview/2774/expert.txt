 Given a map of the woods and the jogging trails included in the minimum spanning tree created by the professors. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one route between each pair of intersections, where a route is a set of adjacent trails. Your task is to find the minimum number of additional lamps you needed in order to satisfy the frightened runners, no matter which trails they use (subject to the restrictions above) 
-----Input----- Input starts with two integers $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 50000$), and $S$ ($1 \leq S \leq 10^4$), the number of intersections and the total distance in meters that a jogger wants to run, respectively. Then follow $N-1$ lines with three integers $a$ ($1 \leq a \leq N$), $b$ ($1 \leq b \leq N$), $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 100$), meaning that there is a bidirectional trail between intersection $a$ and $b$ with length $d$ meters. Then follows a line with a single integer $L$ ($0 \leq L \leq N$), the number of lamps that have already been placed. Then follow $L$ distinct integers $\ell _1, \dots , \ell _ L$ on one line, meaning there is already a lamp placed at intersections $\ell _1, \dots , \ell _ L$. The university campus is at intersection number 1. -----Output----- Output contains a single integer, the minimum number of additional lamps you need to place in order to satisfy the joggersâ€™ requirements. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 6 1 2 1 1 3 1 4 3 3 3 5 2 1 1 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 5 6 1 2 1 1 3 1 4 3 3 3 5 2 1 3 Sample Output 2: 1
