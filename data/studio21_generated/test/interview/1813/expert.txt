 You are given an array of $n$ integers. You want to split them into some non-empty subsets. For each subset, it must satisfy:  Each subset should contain at least l numbers.  The difference between the maximal and the minimal number in the subset should be at most s. Please help Alexandra to find the minimal number of subsets meeting the condition above. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three space-separated integers n, s, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ s ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_{i} separated by spaces ( - 10^9 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Output the minimal number of strip pieces. If there are no ways to split the strip, output -1. -----Examples----- Input 7 2 2 1 3 1 2 4 1 2 Output 3 Input 7 2 2 1 100 1 100 1 100 1 Output -1 -----Note----- For the first sample, we can split the strip into 3 pieces: [1, 3, 1], [2, 4], [1, 2]. For the second sample, we can't let 1 and 100 be on the same piece, so no solution exists.
