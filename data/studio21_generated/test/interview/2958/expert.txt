 You are given $n$ cards. You need to find the number of combos Anthony can get if he trades cards optimally. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers $N$, $T$, and $K$, $1\leq K\leq T\leq 100000$, $1\leq N\leq 2T$. The next line is a list of $N$ integers representing the cards in Anthony’s deck. Each integer on this line is between $1$ and $T$ inclusive. It is guaranteed no integers appear more than twice. Finally, each of the next $T$ lines of the input contains two integers each. The $i^\mathrm {th}$ line contains $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, $1\leq a_ i, b_ i\leq 10^9$, corresponding to the price of buying and selling a card of type $i$. -----Output----- Output a single integer denoting Anthony’s profit assuming he trades optimally. -----Explanation of Sample Input----- In the first example, Anthony should sell two of card $1$ and buy one of card $2$ and one of card $3$ for a net profit of $10$ coins. If he chooses to sell one of card $3$ and buy one of card $2$, then he’ll end up spending $20$ coins. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 2 1 3 2 1  1 50 50 20 40 30 Sample Output: 10
