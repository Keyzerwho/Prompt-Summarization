 You are given an array consisting of n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty. Each step you selects a non-empty array cell with the maximum index and moves the number written in it to the nearest empty cell to the left of the selected one. The process continues until all n numbers will appear in the first n cells of the array. For example if n = 4, the array is changing as follows: [Image]  You have to write a program that allows you to determine what number will be in the cell with index x (1   x   n) after Vasya's algorithm finishes. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ x ≤ n), that represent the number of the boxes and the index of the box that got the last ball from Vasya, correspondingly. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where integer a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9, a_{x} ≠ 0) represents the number of balls in the box with index i after Vasya completes all the actions.  Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Output----- Print n integers, where the i-th one represents the number of balls in the box number i before Vasya starts acting. Separate the numbers in the output by spaces. If there are multiple correct solutions, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 4 4 3 1 6 Output 3 2 5 4  Input 5 2 3 2 0 2 7 Output 2 1 4 1 6  Input 3 3 2 3 1 Output 1 2 3
