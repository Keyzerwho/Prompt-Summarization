 Given a list of integers representing the locations of buildings on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B). 
Notes:        The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].        The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.        The output list must be sorted by the x position.        There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]
