 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $k$. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum number of coatings s you need to buy in order to get the coating t for your running track. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains the string s — the coating that is present in the shop. Second line contains the string t — the coating Ayrat wants to obtain. Both strings are non-empty, consist of only small English letters and their length doesn't exceed 2100. -----Output----- The first line should contain the minimum needed number of coatings n or -1 if it's impossible to create the desired coating. If the answer is not -1, then the following n lines should contain two integers x_{i} and y_{i} — numbers of ending blocks in the corresponding piece. If x_{i} ≤ y_{i} then this piece is used in the regular order, and if x_{i} > y_{i} piece is used in the reversed order. Print the pieces in the order they should be glued to get the string t. -----Examples----- Input abc cbaabc Output 2 3 1 1 3 Input aaabrytaaa ayrat Output 3 1 1 6 5 8 7 Input ami no Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample string "cbaabc" = "cba" + "abc". In the second sample: "ayrat" = "a" + "yr" + "at".
