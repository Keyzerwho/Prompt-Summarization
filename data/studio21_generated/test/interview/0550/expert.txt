 You are given a list of existing logins with no two similar logins, and a newly created user login. Check whether this new login is similar with any of the existing ones. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a non-empty string s consisting of lower and uppercase latin letters, digits and underline symbols («_») with length not exceeding 50  — the login itself. The second line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1 000) — the number of existing logins. The next n lines describe the existing logins, following the same constraints as the user login (refer to the first line of the input). It's guaranteed that no two existing logins are similar. -----Output----- Print «Yes» (without quotes), if user can register via this login, i.e. none of the existing logins is similar with it. Otherwise print «No» (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 1_wat 2 2_wat wat_1 Output Yes Input 000 3 00 ooA oOo Output No Input _i_ 3 __i_ _1_ I Output No Input La0 3 2a0 La1 1a0 Output No Input abc 1 aBc Output No Input 0Lil 2 LIL0 0Ril Output Yes -----Note----- In the second sample case the user wants to create a login consisting of three zeros. It's impossible due to collision with the third among the existing. In the third sample case the new login is similar with the second one.
