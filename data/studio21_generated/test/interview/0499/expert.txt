 You are given n cards. You are given two cards. You need to return the color of third card. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — the total number of cards. The next line contains a string s of length n — the colors of the cards. s contains only the characters 'B', 'G', and 'R', representing blue, green, and red, respectively. -----Output----- Print a single string of up to three characters — the possible colors of the final card (using the same symbols as the input) in alphabetical order. -----Examples----- Input 2 RB Output G Input 3 GRG Output BR Input 5 BBBBB Output B -----Note----- In the first sample, Catherine has one red card and one blue card, which she must exchange for a green card. In the second sample, Catherine has two green cards and one red card. She has two options: she can exchange the two green cards for a green card, then exchange the new green card and the red card for a blue card. Alternatively, she can exchange a green and a red card for a blue card, then exchange the blue card and remaining green card for a red card. In the third sample, Catherine only has blue cards, so she can only exchange them for more blue cards.
