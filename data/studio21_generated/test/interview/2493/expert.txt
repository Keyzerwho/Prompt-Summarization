 You are given an integer sequence of length n+1, a_1,a_2,...,a_{n+1}, which consists of the n integers 1,...,n. It is known that each of the n integers 1,...,n appears at least once in this sequence. For each integer k=1,...,n+1, find the number of the different subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: n a_1 a_2 ... a_{n+1} -----Output----- Print n+1 lines. The k-th line should contain the number of the different subsequences of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 2 1 3 -----Sample Output----- 3 5 4 1 There are three subsequences with length 1: 1 and 2 and 3. There are five subsequences with length 2: 1,1 and 1,2 and 1,3 and 2,1 and 2,3. There are four subsequences with length 3: 1,1,3 and 1,2,1 and 1,2,3 and 2,1,3. There is one subsequence with length 4: 1,2,1,3.
