 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). The next line contains a list of space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100).  The third line contains an integer m, (0 ≤ m ≤ 100). Each of the next m lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i}. The integers mean that for the i-th time Shaass shoot the y_{i}-th (from left) bird on the x_{i}-th wire, (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ y_{i}). It's guaranteed there will be at least y_{i} birds on the x_{i}-th wire at that moment. -----Output----- On the i-th line of the output print the number of birds on the i-th wire. -----Examples----- Input 5 10 10 10 10 10 5 2 5 3 13 2 12 1 13 4 6 Output 0 12 5 0 16 Input 3 2 4 1 1 2 2 Output 3 0 3
