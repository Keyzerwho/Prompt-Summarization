 Given an integer, return the number of years that have exactly one zero in the binary representation. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10^18) — the first year and the last year in Limak's interval respectively. -----Output----- Print one integer – the number of years Limak will count in his chosen interval. -----Examples----- Input 5 10 Output 2 Input 2015 2015 Output 1 Input 100 105 Output 0 Input 72057594000000000 72057595000000000 Output 26 -----Note----- In the first sample Limak's interval contains numbers 5_10 = 101_2, 6_10 = 110_2, 7_10 = 111_2, 8_10 = 1000_2, 9_10 = 1001_2 and 10_10 = 1010_2. Two of them (101_2 and 110_2) have the described property.
