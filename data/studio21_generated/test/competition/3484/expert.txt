 You are given a number $n$ and a value $k$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $k$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $k=3$, numbers divisible by $k$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line lists two space-separated integers $1 \le n \le 100$ and $0 \le k \le n$, denoting the size of the grid $(n\times n)$ and the number of rows $k$ that are already filled in. Each of the following $k$ lines contains $n$ space-separated integers, denoting the first $k$ given rows. All integers in these $k$ lines are between $1$ and $n$. -----Output----- Output either “yes” or “no” on the first line, indicating if there is a solution. If there is no solution, do not output anything more. If there is a solution, output $n$ more lines, each containing $n$ space-separated integers, representing a solution. If there are multiple solutions, output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 2 1 2 3 4 2 3 4 1 Sample Output: yes 1 2 3 4  2 3 4 1  3 4 1 2  4 1 2 3
