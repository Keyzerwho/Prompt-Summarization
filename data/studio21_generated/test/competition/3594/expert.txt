 You are given arrays of integers. For each round, find the lowest possible score Odd can get. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$), the number of rounds they played that evening. Then follow $n$ lines each beginning with the first character of the name of the starting player (either ’O’, ’E’ or ’I’), followed by a space and then the starting number for that round, in the range $[1, 10000]$ Note: If the starting number is $1$, all players receive $1$ point for that round. -----Output----- Output a single line with the score at the end of the day for each of the three contestants, in the order “Odd”, “Even”, “Ingmariay”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 O 4 Sample Output: 2 1 4
