 You are given two arrays of size $R \times C$. The first array contains the positions of all chess pieces and the second array contains the distance values between all pairs of pieces. Your task is to calculate Mirko and Slavko s spread. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \le R , C \le 1000$), number of rows and columns. Next $R$ lines contain $C$ characters each. Character ‘M’ denotes Mirko’s piece, ‘S’ Slavko’s piece and ‘.’ denotes an empty field. There is at least one piece per player on the board. Otherwise the game would be over. -----Output----- In the first and only line of output you need to print exactly two integers. The first integers is the spread of Mirko’s and the second Slavko’s pieces. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 3 SMS MMS Sample Output 1: 3 5 Sample Input 2: 2 3 S.M M.. Sample Output 2: 2 0
