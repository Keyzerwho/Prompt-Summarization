 You are given $n$ gas stations and the cost of gas per gallon. You are given the capacity of Tony s car. You need to find the minimum cost to travel from Tony s initial position to the rightmost gas station. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $g$. It is guaranteed that $1\leq n, g\leq 200000$. The next $n$ lines contains two integers each. The first integer $d_ i$ is the distance of the gas station to the right of the origin (in kilometers). The second integer $c_ i$ is the cost per gallon of gas. It is guaranteed that $1\leq d_ i\leq 4\cdot 10^{10}$, $1\leq c_ i\leq 10^9$, and that no two gas stations are located at the same point. -----Output----- If it is possible for Tony to complete his trip without running out of gas, print a single integer $C$, the minimum cost to complete the trip. Otherwise, print “cancel road trip” (without quotes). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 10 2 100 1 10 11 5 Sample Output 1: 10 Sample Input 2: 3 10 2 100 1 10 13 5 Sample Output 2: cancel road trip
