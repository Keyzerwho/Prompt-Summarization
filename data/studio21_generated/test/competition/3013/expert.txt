 Given an Archimedean spiral s angular velocity, compute the point at which the player would need to press the button to release the avatar from the spiral in order to hit the target. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line with $3$ real numbers $b$, $t_ x$, and $t_ y$, denoting the parameter $b$ ($0.01 \le b \le 10$) of the spiral described by $r = b \ \phi $ and the $x, y$ coordinates of the target $T = (t_ x, t_ y)$, restricted by $-10000 \le t_ x, t_ y \le 10000$. It is guaranteed that $\sqrt{t_ x^2+t_ y^2} > 2 \pi b$, i.e., the avatar will stay on the spiral for at least one full $360$ degree turn. It is also guaranteed that the distance from point $T$ to the closest point on the spiral will be greater than $10^{-3}$. There may be up to $12$ significant digits in $b$, and up to $3$ digits after the decimal point in $t_ x$ and $t_ y$. -----Output----- Output the $x, y$ coordinates of the point on the spiral where the avatar should leave the spiral, continue in the direction it is moving, and hit the target without intersecting the spiral. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error of both $x$ and $y$ does not exceed $10^{-5}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 0.5 -5.301 3.098 Sample Output 1: -1.26167861 3.88425357 Sample Input 2: 0.5 8 8 Sample Output 2: 9.21068947 2.56226688 Sample Input 3: 1 8 8 Sample Output 3: 6.22375968 -0.31921472 Sample Input 4: 0.5 -8 8 Sample Output 4: -4.36385220 9.46891588
