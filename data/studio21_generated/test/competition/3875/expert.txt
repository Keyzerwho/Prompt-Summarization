 Given an integer sequence of length N: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N. An integer sequence X, which is also of length N, will be chosen randomly by independently choosing X_i from a uniform distribution on the integers 1, 2, \ldots, A_i for each i (1 \leq i \leq N). Compute the expected value of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence X, modulo 1000000007. More formally, under the constraints of the problem, we can prove that the expected value can be represented as a rational number, that is, an irreducible fraction, and there uniquely exists an integer R such that R \times Q \equiv P \pmod {1000000007} and 0 \leq R < 1000000007, so print this integer R. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 A_2 \cdots A_N -----Output----- Print the expected value modulo 1000000007. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 2 3 -----Sample Output----- 2 X becomes one of the following, with probability 1/6 for each:  - X = (1,1,1), for which the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1;  - X = (1,1,2), for which the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 2;  - X = (1,1,3), for which the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 2;  - X = (1,2,1), for which the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 2;  - X = (1,2,2), for which the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 2;  - X = (1,2,3), for which the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 3. Thus, the expected value of the length of the longest increasing subsequence is (1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3) / 6 \equiv 2 \pmod {1000000007}.
