 You are given n buttons. You are asked to figure out how many times you can do the following. 
-----Input----- There will be a single test case in the input. The first line of this case will contain $n$ ($2 \le n \le 80$) giving the number of people (and the number of buttons) in the experiment. The next $n$ lines will contain $n$ characters each. If the $j^{th}$ character of the $i^{th}$ line is Y it indicates that the $i^{th}$ person can stand on the $j^{th}$ button (it is N otherwise). -----Output----- Output $k$, the maximum number of times everyone can be standing on buttons such that nobody stands on the same button more than once (This might be $0$). After that, output $k$ lines. Each line should contain $n$ integers separated by single spaces, where the $i^{th}$ integer describes which person is standing on the $i^{th}$ button. All of the lines should be valid and none of them should put the same person on the same button as a previous line of the same test case. Note that correct outputs might not be unique. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 YYY NYY YNY Sample Output: 2 1 2 3 3 1 2
