 You are given a square box of chocolates. You are given the dimensions of the box. You need to count the number of ways you can make a polygon. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of input consists of two space-separated integers $R$ and $C$ ($1 \leq R, C \leq 4$), specifying the dimensions of the box of chocolates. -----Output----- Print, on a single line, the number of different ways that chocolates can form a single polygon in the box. Note that if the same polygon can be placed at multiple different places in the box, then all of those ways are counted separately towards the answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 2 Sample Output: 3
