 You are given coordinates of vertices of a cube. You need to output coordinates of vertices of the cube after Nick's mischief. 
-----Input----- Each of the eight lines contains three space-separated integers — the numbers written on the piece of paper after Nick's mischief. All numbers do not exceed 10^6 in their absolute value. -----Output----- If there is a way to restore the cube, then print in the first line "YES". In each of the next eight lines print three integers — the restored coordinates of the points. The numbers in the i-th output line must be a permutation of the numbers in i-th input line. The numbers should represent the vertices of a cube with non-zero length of a side. If there are multiple possible ways, print any of them. If there is no valid way, print "NO" (without the quotes) in the first line. Do not print anything else. -----Examples----- Input 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 Output YES 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 Input 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output NO
