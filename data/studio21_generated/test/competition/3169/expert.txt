 You are given a table in the coordinate system with a square that has opposite points in the coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(10000, 10000)$. The sticks will be represented with straight line segments that lie within that square. It is your task to help Arthur determine the order of stick movements that meets the requirements from the previous paragraph. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 5000$), the number of sticks on the table. Each of the following $N$ lines contains four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$ ($0 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 10000$) that denote the edge points of a stick. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain space-separated stick labels in the order which they need to be taken off the table. A stickâ€™s label corresponds to its position in the input sequence. If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 1 3 2 2 1 1 3 2 2 4 7 3 3 3 5 3 Sample Output 1: 2 4 1 3 Sample Input 2: 4 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 3 2 2 3 3 4 0 3 1 Sample Output 2: 4 3 1 2
