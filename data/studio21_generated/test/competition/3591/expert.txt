 You are given a sequence of heights for $k$ photos. You need to find which of these photos could potentially be the photo you re looking for. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains $1\leq k\leq 1000$, the number of photos you have to process.  - Then follow two lines for each photo.  - The first line contains a single integer $3 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^5$, the number of people on this photo.  - The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $1\leq h_1, \dots , h_ n \leq 10^9$, the heights of the people in the photo, from left to right. It is guaranteed that the total number of people in all photos is at most $3\cdot 10^5$. -----Output-----  - On the first line, output the number of photos $k$ that need further investigation.  - Then print $k$ lines each containing a single integer $1\leq a_ i \leq n$, the sorted indices of the photos you need to look at. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 3 2 1 3 Sample Output: 1 1
