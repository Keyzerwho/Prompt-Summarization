 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \le N \le 100$, $0 \le M \le 1000$), the number of children and the number of purchases they recall. The children are labeled $1$ through $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers, the number of cards each child currently has. The total number of cards of all children is at most $2000$. The following $M$ lines contain two integers $a \ne b$ each, the labels of the children who made the purchase. -----Output----- On the first line, output the total number of purchases. Each of the following lines should describe one purchase. The description of a purchase consists of three numbers: the two distinct labels of the children that made the purchase and the number $0$, $1$ or $2$, how many cards the first child got after the race. Note: A solution will always exist, although it will not necessarily be unique. -----Explanation of Sample Input 1----- In the first example, there are only two children, labeled $1$ and $2$. The first child should end up with five cards, the second with one. After the first purchase, each of the children got one card. After the second and third purchases, the first child got both cards both times. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 3 5 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 Sample Output 1: 3 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 Sample Input 2: 4 3 5 3 1 1 1 3 2 3 4 1 Sample Output 2: 5 1 3 1 2 3 2 4 1 0 2 4 1 3 1 0
