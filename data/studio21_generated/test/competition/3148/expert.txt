 You are given two lifeguards. The lifeguards are responsible for swimmers. The lifeguards position themselves such that each lifeguard is responsible for the same number of swimmers. The lifeguards want at most one swimmer for whom the distance to each lifeguard is equal. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains an integer $2\leq n \leq 10^5$, the number of swimmers.  - Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $-10^9\leq x\leq 10^9$ and $-10^9\leq y\leq 10^9$, the position of the swimmer. -----Output----- Print two lines, both containing integers $x$ and $y$ with $-10^{18}\leq x,y\leq 10^{18}$, the locations of you and your coworker. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 -1 -1 0 Sample Output 1: -3 -1 3 1 Sample Input 2: 4 2 4 6 -1 3 5 -1 -1 Sample Output 2: 3 4 3 -1
