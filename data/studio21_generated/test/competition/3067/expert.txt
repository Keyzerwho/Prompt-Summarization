 You are given $N$ integers. You need to find the best possible sequence.
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$), the number of starting sequences. The next $N$ lines contain descriptions of input sequences. Each line starts with an integer $L$ ($1 \leq L \leq 1000$), the length of the sequence. It is followed by $L$ positive integers, each at most $100000000$. -----Output----- One line containing $\sum L$ numbers, the best possible “Solution sequence” obtainable. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 2 1 100 1 1 Sample Output 1: 1 2 100 Sample Input 2: 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 2 28 27 Sample Output 2: 10 20 28 27 30 40 50
