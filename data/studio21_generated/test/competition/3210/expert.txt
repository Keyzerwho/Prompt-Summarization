 Given an $N\times N$ square lattice of dots, two players alternate drawing line segments between horizontally or vertically adjacent dots. The game ends when lattice is completely filled with line segments. 
-----Input----- Input starts with a line containing an integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 80$), the size of the square lattice. Then follows an ASCII representation of the current state of the game, $2N-1$ rows high and $2N-1$ columns wide, listed in row-major order. There are cells of four types ($1 \leq i,j \leq N$):  - Cell $(2i-1,2j-1)$ is ‘*’, representing dot $(i,j)$.  - Cell $(2i,2j)$ is ‘.’, representing empty space.  - Cell $(2i,2j-1)$ is ‘|’ if dots $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$ have been connected by a line segment, and ‘.’ otherwise.  - Cell $(2i-1,2j)$ is ‘-’ if dots $(i,j)$ and $(i,j+1)$ have been connected by a line segment, and ‘.’ otherwise. It is guaranteed that no player has scored a point, meaning that no unit squares have been formed. -----Output----- Output the number of moves that can be made, in the worst case, before either Alice or Bob is guaranteed to have scored a point. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 *-*.* |.|.| *.*-* |...| *.*.* Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 2 *.* ... *.* Sample Output 2: 4
