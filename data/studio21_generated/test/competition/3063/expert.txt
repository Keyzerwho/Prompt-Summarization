-----Input----- First line of input contains one integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 200000$), number of inhabitants of Križ. They are numbered from $1$ to $N$. The following $N$ lines contain two integers, separated by space. In the $i$’th of those lines, the first number $A_ i$ represents the id of the person $i$’th person owes money to ($1 \le A_ i \le N$, $A_ i \ne i$), and the second number $B_ i$ represents the ammount of the debt in $ ($1 \le B_ i \le 10000$). -----Output----- The first and only line of output should contain one integer – the minimum total ammount of money town has to give to its inhabitants so all debts are returned. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 2 100 1 100 4 70 3 70 Sample Output 1: 170 Sample Input 2: 3 2 120 3 50 2 80 Sample Output 2: 150
