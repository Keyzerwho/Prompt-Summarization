 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 
-----Input-----  - A single line containing $1\leq n\leq 20$, the number of theorems.  - For each theorem:  - A single line containing $1\leq p_ i\leq 10$, the number of proofs for the $i$th theorem.  - $p_ i$ lines, each of the form $l$, $k$, $d_0,\dots ,d_{k-1}$, where $0\leq l\leq 10^6$ is the length of the proof, $0\leq k\leq n-1$ is the number of theorems the proof depends on, and the $0\leq d_ i\leq n-1$ are the numbers of the theorems the proof depends on. -----Output----- Print one line with a single integer, the shortest possible length of Davidâ€™s article. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 2 10 0 3 1 1 1 4 1 0 Sample Output: 10
