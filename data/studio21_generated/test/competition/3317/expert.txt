 Your program should list the longest sequence of identical trades from `start` and `end`. 
-----Input----- There will be a single test case in the input. This test case will start with a string $s$ on the first line, consisting solely of upper case and lower case letters ($1 \le \text {length}(s) \le 100000$). On the next line will be an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 100000$), indicating the number of queries. The following $q$ lines each describe a query with two integers, $i$ and $j$ ($0 \le i < j < \text {length}(s)$), which represent two zero-based positions in the string. -----Output----- For each query, output a single integer, indicating the length of the longest sequence of trades starting at $i$ which is identical to the sequence of trades starting at $j$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: ABABABcABABAbAbab 3 0 2 1 6 0 7 Sample Output: 4 0 5
