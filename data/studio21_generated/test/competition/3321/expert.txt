 You are given two sequences, the starting sequence and the resulting sequence. You need to compute a sequence of proclamations needed for the Regent to rearrange the frogs into the resulting sequence. Naturally, the starting and resulting sequences will not be equal.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer $N$, the number of frogs ($3 \le N \le 100$). The second line of input contains a permutation of the first $N$ positive integers, the starting frog sequence. The third line of input contains another permutation of the first $N$ positive integers, the resulting frog sequence. -----Output----- Output any sequence of integers (one integer per line) that the Frog Regent can proclaim in order to rearrange the frogs into the resulting sequence. The number of proclamations must not exceed $100000$. The test data will be such that a solution exists. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 1 5 4 3 2 6 1 2 5 4 3 6 Sample Output: 2
