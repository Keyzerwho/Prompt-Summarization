 You are given an H x W grid. Each square contains a lowercase English letter. You want the grid to be symmetric. That is, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W, the letter in the square at the i-th row and j-th column and the letter in the square at the (H + 1 - i)-th row and (W + 1 - j)-th column should be equal. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: H W S_1 S_2 : S_H -----Output----- If Snuke can make the grid symmetric, print YES; if he cannot, print NO. -----Sample Input----- 2 3 arc rac -----Sample Output----- YES If the second and third columns from the left are swapped, the grid becomes symmetric, as shown in the image below:
