 You are given an array of spots with coordinates in the range from $-20000$ to $20000$. The symmetry can be around a point or across a line. You need to output the least number of additional spots needed to generate a pattern with some symmetry. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will consist of a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) indicating the number of spots. Each of the next $n$ lines will hold two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ ($-20000 \le x,y \le 20000$), which are the coordinates of a spot. The locations of all spots are guaranteed to be unique. -----Output----- Output a single integer, indicating the smallest number of spots which need to be added so that all of the spots are symmetric about some point, or about some line. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 0 0 1000 0 0 1000 1000 1000 Sample Output: 0
