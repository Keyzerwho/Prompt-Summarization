 You are given a graph of directed edges. You need to find shortest path in graph. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with two integers $a$, $b$ ($0 \le a \le b \le 10^{12}$), indicating that Janet will be ready in at least $a$ minutes and at most $b$ minutes.  - One line with two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \le n \le m \le 10^5$), the number of intersections and the number of roads in the neighbourhood. The intersections are numbered from $1$ to $n$.  - $m$ lines, each with three integers $u$, $v$ and $t$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$, $1 \le t \le 10^6$), indicating that there is a one-way road from intersection $u$ to intersection $v$, and that it takes Richard exactly $t$ minutes to travel along this road. Richard’s house is at intersection $1$ and Janet’s house is at intersection $n$. It is guaranteed that it is possible to travel from Richard’s house to Janet’s house, and that it is possible to exit each intersection through at least one road, even if that road just loops back to the same intersection. -----Output----- Output the time Janet has to wait in the worst case assuming she will be ready in at least $a$ minutes and at most $b$ minutes and Richard plans his route optimally. It can be shown that the worst case waiting time is always an integer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10 20 3 5 1 3 7 2 1 1 2 3 2 2 3 5 3 2 4 Sample Output: 6
