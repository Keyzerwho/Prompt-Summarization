 You are given a map of the USA. Each cell is either passable or non-passable. A cell is passable if it belongs to a state, or a road was built there. A cell is non-passable if a road is not allowed to be built there. Your task is to construct a road inside a minimum number of cells, so that it would be possible to get from any cell of any state to any cell of any other state using only passable cells. It is guaranteed that initially it is possible to reach any cell of any state from any cell of this state, moving only along its cells. It is also guaranteed that for any state there is at least one cell that belongs to it. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the dimensions of the map n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) — the number of rows and columns respectively. Each of the next n lines contain m characters, describing the rows of the map. Digits from 1 to 3 represent the accessory to the corresponding state. The character '.' corresponds to the cell where it is allowed to build a road and the character '#' means no construction is allowed in this cell. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of cells you need to build a road inside in order to connect all the cells of all states. If such a goal is unachievable, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 4 5 11..2 #..22 #.323 .#333 Output 2 Input 1 5 1#2#3 Output -1
