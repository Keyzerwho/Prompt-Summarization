 You are given two integers $a$ and $b$. You need to calculate the least number of drivers that can be irritated when Per closes down the lane in one direction. Assume that a car gets irritated if the time between the moment he arrives at the maintained segment and the moment he is actually given the  go  exceeds his irritation time limit. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $t$ and $n$ ($4 \leq t \leq 180$ and $1\leq n\leq 250$), where $t$ is the time in seconds needed for a car to pass the segment under maintenance, and $n$ is the total number of cars arriving at the segment. The following $n$ lines describe the cars. The $i$-th line contains the description of the $i$-th car in the following format:  - one character $d$, being W for cars arriving at the west endpoint of the segment, and E for the ones that arrive at the east endpoint; and  - two integers $a$ and $r$ ($0 \leq a < 86400$ and $0 \leq r \leq 3600$), where $a$ denotes the arrival time in seconds after midnight, and $r$ denotes the time in seconds it takes for the driver to get irritated. The cars arrive in the order specified in the input and they cannot overtake each other. In particular, a car whose driver is already irritated has to stay in the queue until eventually receiving the “go” and passing the maintained segment. -----Output----- Output one line with the least possible number of irritated drivers. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 8 3 W 10 0 W 10 3 E 17 4 Sample Output: 0
