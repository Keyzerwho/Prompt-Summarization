 You are given information about each different pill introduced into the market (the time it is introduced, in seconds, and its corresponding $x$ and $y$ values as previously described) and $c$, the number of seconds you automatically age when switching pills (or switching to a pill from no pill at all), determine the longest you can live, over all possible schedule of pills you could take. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of three positive integers, $n$ ($n \le 3\cdot 10^9$), representing the number of seconds you would live without taking any pills, $p$ ($p \le 10^5$), the number of pills that become available on the market, and $c$ ($c \le 10^5$), the time in seconds you age as soon as you switch to a different pill. $p$ lines follow with the $i^{th}$ line containing three space separated integers: $t_{i}$ $(1 \le t_{i} \le 10^{12})$, $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ $(1 \le y_{i} < x_{i} \le 10^{4}$), representing the time the $i^{th}$ pill gets introduced to the market, and the corresponding $x$ and $y$ values for it. In addition, for all $i$, $1 \le i \le n-1$, it is guaranteed that $t_{i+1} - t_{i} > c$. -----Output----- Output a single real number, representing the maximum number of seconds that you could live, if you take the appropriate pills. Your answer should be correct within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 100 3 10 15 99 98 40 3 2 90 10 9 Sample Output: 115.000000000
