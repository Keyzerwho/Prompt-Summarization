 You are given an array of integers. Find an optimal reconstruction of text. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 250)$, the number of text fragments. Each of the next $n$ lines contains one of the text fragments. A text fragment is a nonempty string of printable characters of length at most $80$, where a printable character has an ASCII value in the range $32 \ldots 126$, inclusive. All $n$ fragments are distinct, and no fragment begins or ends with a space. -----Output----- If there is a unique optimal reconstruction, output this reconstruction on a single line. Otherwise, output “AMBIGUOUS”. (No optimal reconstruction ever equals “AMBIGUOUS”.) -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 n fox jumps ove uick brown f The quick b y dog. rown fox mps over the l the lazy dog Sample Output 1: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Sample Input 2: 4 cdefghi efghijk efghijx abcdefg Sample Output 2: AMBIGUOUS
