 You are given a string s. You are also given positions l and r. Return the minimum possible number of different letters in string s on the segment between positions l and r, inclusive. 
-----Input----- First and only line contains four space-separated integers: a, b, l and r (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 12, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9) — the numbers of letters each player appends and the bounds of the segment. -----Output----- Print one integer — the minimum possible number of different letters in the segment from position l to position r, inclusive, in string s. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 8 Output 2 Input 4 2 2 6 Output 3 Input 3 7 4 6 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first sample test one of optimal strategies generate string s = "abababab...", that's why answer is 2. In the second sample test string s = "abcdbcaefg..." can be obtained, chosen segment will look like "bcdbc", that's why answer is 3. In the third sample test string s = "abczzzacad..." can be obtained, chosen, segment will look like "zzz", that's why answer is 1.
