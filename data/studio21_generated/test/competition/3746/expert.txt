 You are given matrix t and an integer n. You need to count the minimal cost of solving SmallY's puzzle, consisting of n disks.   
-----Input----- Each of the first three lines contains three integers — matrix t. The j-th integer in the i-th line is t_{ij} (1 ≤ t_{ij} ≤ 10000; i ≠ j). The following line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 40) — the number of disks. It is guaranteed that for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ 3), t_{ii} = 0. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum cost of solving SmallY's puzzle. -----Examples----- Input 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 3 Output 7 Input 0 2 2 1 0 100 1 2 0 3 Output 19 Input 0 2 1 1 0 100 1 2 0 5 Output 87
