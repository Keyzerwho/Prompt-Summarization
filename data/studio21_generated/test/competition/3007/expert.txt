 You are given a list of strings where each string in format of "A,B,C,D". where A,D are strings and B,C are numbers. A string is possibly invalid if: the C exceeds 1000, or; if two strings have same A and different D and the difference between C is greater than or equal to 60. return list of strings which are possibley invalid in any order 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing six integers $d$, $b$, $f$, $t_0$, $t_1$ and $t_2$ ($1 \le d \le 40$, $0 \le b \le 500$, and $0 \le f, t_0, t_1, t_2 \le 100$), where:  - $d$ is the number of remaining days Johan has  - $b$ is the current amount of Bling Johan has.  - $f$ is the current number of fruits Johan has.  - $t_ i$ is the number of fruit trees Johan has that will yield crop $i$ days from today (for $0 \le i \le 2$). Johan currently does not have any exotic fruits or exotic fruit trees. -----Output----- Output a single integer: the maximum amount of Bling Johan can have after playing $d$ days. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 0 1 0 0 0 Sample Output 1: 300 Sample Input 2: 5 0 1 0 1 0 Sample Output 2: 1900 Sample Input 3: 6 0 1 1 0 0 Sample Output 3: 2300 Sample Input 4: 10 399 0 0 0 0 Sample Output 4: 399
