 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the size of the permutation. As the permutation is not important, you can consider a_{i} = i, where the permutation is a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. -----Output----- If it is not possible to swap all pairs of positions so that the permutation stays the same, print "NO", Otherwise print "YES", then print $\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$ lines: the i-th of these lines should contain two integers a and b (a < b) — the positions where the i-th swap is performed. -----Examples----- Input 3 Output NO Input 1 Output YES
