 You are given a task sequence $T = (t_1, t_2, \ldots t_n)$, where $t_i \in [0, 1)$ and $t_i$ is the number of times to execute instruction $i$. You need to simulate the execution of $T$ according to this protocol. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 20)$, which is the number of tasks, and $r$ ($1 \leq r \leq 20$), which is the number of resources. This is followed by $t$ lines, where the $i^\text {th}$ of these lines describes task $i$. The description of a task begins with three integers: the taskâ€™s start time $s$ ($1 \leq s \leq 10000$), its base priority $b$ ($1 \leq b \leq t$), and an integer $a$ ($1 \leq a \leq 100$). A task description is concluded by a sequence of $a$ strings describing the instructions. Each string is a letter (C or L or U) followed by an integer. The string C$n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$) indicates a sequence of $n$ compute instructions. The strings L$k$ and U$k$ ($1 \leq k \leq r$) indicate instructions locking and unlocking resource $k$ respectively. No two tasks have the same base priority. -----Output----- For each task, display the time it completes execution, in the same order that the tasks are given in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 50 2 5 C1 L1 C1 U1 C1 1 1 5 C1 L1 C100 U1 C1 70 3 1 C1 Sample Output: 106 107 71
