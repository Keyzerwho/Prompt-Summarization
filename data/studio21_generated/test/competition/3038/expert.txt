 You are given a list of companies. Each company sells packs. Each pack contains a number of bolts. You need to find the smallest pack that contains at least $B$ bolts. 
-----Input-----  - The first line of the input contains an integer $1 \leq B \leq 10^3$ giving the number of bolts that you need.  - The second line of the input contains an integer $1 \leq k \leq 10$ giving the number of companies.  - The next $k$ lines each describe a company. Each line consists of the integers $l_ i, n_1, n_2, \ldots , n_{l_ i}$ meaning that the company $i$ produces $1\leq l_ i\leq 10$ types of packages of sizes $0 < n_1< n_2< \ldots < n_{l_ i} \leq 10^3$, respectively. -----Output-----  - A single integer giving the smallest size of a package that you can buy which contains at least $B$ bolts no matter how the companies build their packages, or impossible if this cannot be achieved. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 371 3 2 40 65 2 100 150 2 300 320 Sample Output 1: impossible Sample Input 2: 310 3 2 40 65 2 100 150 2 300 320 Sample Output 2: 300 Sample Input 3: 90 2 2 20 35 2 88 200 Sample Output 3: 88
