 You are given $n$ different numbers you want to make combinations of $l$ different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.   
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with the decimal numbers $s$ and $r$ ($1 \le s \le 10$, $0.5 \le r \le s$, at most $6$ digits after the decimal point), the radius of the sandwich and the radius of a pickle, in centimetres.  - one line with the integers $n$ and $z$ ($1 \le n \le 7$, $0 \le z \le 100$), the number of pickles Maj have, and the maximum area she may cover with them, in percent. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of pickles Maj can place on her sandwich. The input will always be constructed such that this number does not change if the radius of the sandwich increases or decreases by $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 4 40 Sample Output: 3
