 Given two Balloon programs, determine whether they are equivalent. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line containing a string A, the first program.  - One line containing a string B, the second program. Each program is a syntactically valid Balloon program with between $3$ and $10^6$ characters, and contains neither spacing nor empty lists (i.e., the strings “ ” or “[]” do not occur in the input). Each integer in each program is greater than $0$ and less than $10^{9}$. -----Output----- If the two programs are equivalent, output “equal”, otherwise output “not equal”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: concat(shuffle([1,2]),shuffle([1,2])) shuffle([1,2,1,2]) Sample Output 1: not equal Sample Input 2: sorted(concat([3,2,1],[4,5,6])) [1,2,3,4,5,6] Sample Output 2: equal
