 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n \leq 100000$, $1 \le d \le 10^8$), where $n$ is the number of frogs and $d$ is the depth of the pit in µm. Then follow $n$ lines each containing three integers $l, w, h$ ($1 \le l, w, h \le 10^8$), representing a frog with leap capacity $l$ µm, weight $w$ µg, and height $h$ µm. The sum of all frogs’ weights is at most $10^8$ µg. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of frogs that can escape the pit. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 19 15 5 3 12 4 4 20 10 5 Sample Output: 3
