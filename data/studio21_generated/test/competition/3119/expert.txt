 You are given a sequence of notes. You need to find the maximum score. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of two integers $1 \leq n \leq 50000$ and $0 \leq p \leq 100$, the number of notes and SP phrases respectively. The second line is a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ integers $0 \leq t_ i \leq 50000000$, the positions of all notes in milliseconds. Then follow $p$ lines containing two integers each, $0 \leq s_ i < e_ i \leq 50000000$, the positions of the start and end of the $i$â€™th Star Power phrase. Notes are guaranteed to exist on the start and end positions of each SP phrase. SP phrases never overlap and are given in ascending order. -----Output----- The maximum score as a single integer. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 0 10 20 0 10 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 6 1 0 10 20 26 40 50 0 40 Sample Output 2: 9
