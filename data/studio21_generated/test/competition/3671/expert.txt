 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 10^5$), the number of job offers you got during the year. The second and final line contains $N$ integers separated with spaces, the times at which you got job offers measured in milliseconds from the start of the year. A year consists of $31556926 \cdot 10^3$ milliseconds. It is guaranteed that each job offer was given at least $4 \cdot 10^5$ milliseconds before the end of the year. -----Output----- Output an integer, the maximum number of cookies you could have earned. -----Explanation of sample 1----- A possible solution is to take the first, third and fourth jobs and build a humongous slide for each one. This results in $12$ cookies. The time between the job offers is at least $4 \cdot 10^5$ milliseconds, so no assignments overlap. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 10000 400000 500000 900000 Sample Output 1: 12 Sample Input 2: 5 8 10 2 1000000 30556926000 Sample Output 2: 12
