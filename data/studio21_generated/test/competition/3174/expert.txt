 Given an array containing only zeros and ones, find the index of the zero that, if converted to one, will make the longest sequence of ones. For instance, given the array: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ``` replacing the zero at index 10 forms a sequence of 9 ones: If there are multiple valid answers, return the last on
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \leq N \leq 50000$, $1 \leq K \leq 30$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains three integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$, $k_ i$ ($0 \leq x_ i, y_ i, k_ i \leq 100000000$), that represent the x coordinate of the city, the y coordinate and the number of residents in that city, respectively. There will not be two cities with the same coordinates in the input data. Additionally, there will not be a single city with the number of residents divisible by $K$. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the minimal $D$ such that it is possible to build roads with the condition that the prime minister is happy. An answer accurate to $3$ decimal places will be accepted. The input data will be such that there is always a solution. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 0 4 4 1 5 1 2 6 1 Sample Output 1: 1.414 Sample Input 2: 6 11 0 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 3 1 1 4 5 5 1 20 20 10 Sample Output 2: 5.657
