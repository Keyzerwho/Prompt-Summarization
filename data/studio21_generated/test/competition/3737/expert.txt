 You are given a connected graph of $n$ nodes and $m$ bidirectional edges. For each node $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, you need to find a minimum spanning tree. Then output the minimum cost required to travel between node $1$ and node $p$. 
-----Input----- First line consists of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of stewards with Jon Snow. Second line consists of n space separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) representing the values assigned to the stewards. -----Output----- Output a single integer representing the number of stewards which Jon will feed. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 5 Output 0 Input 3 1 2 5 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first sample, Jon Snow cannot support steward with strength 1 because there is no steward with strength less than 1 and he cannot support steward with strength 5 because there is no steward with strength greater than 5. In the second sample, Jon Snow can support steward with strength 2 because there are stewards with strength less than 2 and greater than 2.
