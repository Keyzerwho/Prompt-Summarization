 You are given $n$ integers. You need to find $x_ n$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 100000$) from the task. The following line contains $K$ integers that represent the first $K$ elements in the xorbonacci sequence. All numbers are smaller than $10^{18}$. The following line contains the integer $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 10^6$) from the task. The $i$-th of the following $Q$ lines contains two integers $l_ i$ and $r_ i$ ($1 \leq l_ i \leq r_ i \leq 10^{18}$) that represent Marin’s $i$-th query. -----Output----- Each of the following $Q$ lines of output must contain the answers to Marin’s queries, the order being the same as the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 3 5 7 3 2 2 2 5 1 5 Sample Output: 3 1 0
