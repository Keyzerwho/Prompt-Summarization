 You are given $m$ integers $x_1, \dots, x_m$. You need to output $n$ integers $y_1, \dots, y_n$ such that $y_1 = x_1$, $y_2 = x_2$, ..., $y_n = x_m$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 500000$ and $0 \leq m \leq 200000$), the number of seconds until the torpedo runs out of fuel, and the number of ships. Then follow $m$ lines, each containing three integers $x_1, x_2, y$ ($-n \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n$ and $1 \leq y < n$), indicating a ship with endpoints $(x_1, y)$ and $(x_2, y)$. You may assume that no pair of ships touch each other. -----Output----- If it is possible to dodge all the ships, output a string of length $n$ containing the characters $-$, $0$, and $+$. This string represents how the torpedo should turn in each of the $n$ time steps. For example, if the first character is $+$, then the torpedo will start by going from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. If there are multiple solutions, output any one of them. If it is impossible to avoid all the ships, output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 6 -3 -2 3 -2 -2 4 2 3 3 -1 1 2 0 1 4 2 5 1 Sample Output 1: --+0- Sample Input 2: 3 2 1 2 1 -2 0 2 Sample Output 2: 0+-
