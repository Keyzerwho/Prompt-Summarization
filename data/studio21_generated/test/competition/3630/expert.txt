 
-----Input----- Each word puzzle is described on a single line that contains the strings $s_1$ and $s_2$ separated by space. The strings contain only lower case letters. You may also assume that the length of each string is at most $10000000$. -----Output----- Output one line with the smallest number of moves needed to modify $s_1$ into $s_2$. -----Note----- The first sample input can be modified in the following way. First shift lo forward, getting helmp. Then shift h forward 12 times, getting telmp. Then shift l 11 times backward to get teamp and then shift p forward three times to get teams. Total number of moves is $1+12+11+3=27$. The second sample input can be modified as follows. First shift the entire string forward, getting bbdddbbbb. Then shift ddd backward twice to get bbbbbbbbb. This requires 1+2=3 moves. -----Examples----- Sample Input: hello teams Sample Output: 27
