 You are given three numbers $S$, $T$, and $R$. Sort the $(a_ i,b_ i,c_ i)$ triples by the measure $a_ i \cdot S + b_ i \cdot T + R$. Return the index of the $(a_ i,b_ i,c_ i)$ triple with the smallest cluster size. 
-----Input----- The input starts with a line containing $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 250000$), which is the number of people polled. This is followed by one line for each person polled. Each of those lines contains integers $a_ i$ ($0 \leq a_ i \leq 2000000$), $b_ i$ ($0 \leq b_ i \leq 2000000$), and $c_ i$, where $c_ i$ is $1$ if the person will vote for Candidate X and $0$ otherwise. The input is guaranteed to contain at least one person who will vote for Candidate X. -----Output----- Display the smallest possible cluster size over all possible $(S, T)$ pairs. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 0 10 0 10 0 1 12 8 1 5 5 0 11 2 1 11 3 0 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 10 6 1 1 0 2 0 2 1 1 6 1 1 8 2 0 4 4 0 4 0 0 2 3 1 6 1 0 6 3 1 Sample Output 2: 8
