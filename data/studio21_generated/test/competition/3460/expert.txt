 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- There will be a single test case in the input. This test case will begin with a line with a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100000$) representing the number of cans on the fence. Each of the next $n$ lines will have two integers $x$ ($-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) and $r$ ($1 \le r \le 10^9$), where $x$ is the location of the can on the fence and $r$ is the blast radius. No two cans will occupy the same location. -----Output----- Print $n$ integers on a single line separated by single spaces. The $i^{th}$ integer represents the number of cans that will explode if the $i^{th}$ can is the one that is shot. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 4 3 -10 9 -2 3 Sample Output: 1 2 1
