 Given an input string, return the command history. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single number $n$, where $1 \leq n \leq 100000$. Then follows $n$ lines with the user input. Each line consists of characters from the alphabet $\big [$a-zA-Z0-9.^-$\big ]$, i.e. English lower and upper case letters, digits, “-”, “ ”, “.” and the symbol “^” denoting the up key. No command begins or ends with a space. The input is guaranteed to contain at most $10^6$ characters. -----Output----- For each command in the input output a line with the completed command (where all “^” are expanded). The total amount of output is guaranteed to be at most $10^6$ characters. -----Sample Explanation----- In Sample Input $1$ your first command is “python”. Your next command gets auto completed to “python”, and then you write “ main.py”, which is appended to your command making “python main.py”. The last command completes the first up press to “python main.py”, then “ -n 10” is typed which becomes “python main.py -n 10”. In Sample Input $2$ your first two commands are “python” and “java”. The third command becomes auto completed to java, your previous command. The fourth command completes to “python” since it was your third last command. For your fifth command the third last command auto completed is now “java”. In Sample Input $3$ no commands are in your history, so your up presses have no effect and only the non up presses count to your command making “python”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 python p^ main.py ^ -n 10 Sample Output 1: python python main.py python main.py -n 10 Sample Input 2: 5 python java ^ ^^^ ^^^ Sample Output 2: python java java python java
