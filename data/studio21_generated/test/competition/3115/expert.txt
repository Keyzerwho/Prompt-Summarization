 You are given a list of reported matches.  Determine whether the list is consistent or not. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 50000$) and $M$ ($1 \leq M \leq 250000$), to describe a championship with $N$ players and $M$ reported matches. The following $M$ lines each consist of an integer $K$, a symbol which is either ‘=’ or ‘>’, and another integer $L$. The integers $K$ and $L$ each uniquely identify a player ($0 \leq K, L < N$). If the symbol is ‘=’, then the game between $K$ and $L$ was a draw. If the symbol is ‘>’, then $K$ beat $L$ in a match. You may assume that there is at most one reported match between any given pair of players. Also, each player takes part in at least one reported match. -----Output----- Output a single line containing a single word: “consistent” if the list of recorded matches is consistent, and “inconsistent” if it is not. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 0 > 1 1 = 2 0 = 2 Sample Output 1: inconsistent Sample Input 2: 5 5 0 = 1 1 = 2 3 = 4 0 > 3 1 > 4 Sample Output 2: consistent
