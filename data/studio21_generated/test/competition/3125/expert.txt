 You are given a Tweep containing 2 lines of text. The first line contains only double quotes ("). The second line contains only apostrophes ('). You need to decode both lines, and output the result. 
-----Input----- The input is two strings separated by a line. The first string $I$ represents the input characters that was sent in, and the second string $O$ is how Tweeper presents the string. To avoid encoding troubles, apostrophes and double quotes have been replaced with + and -, respectively. -----Output----- The output should have $n$ lines of output, one for each possible encoding + and - may have. Each line must have two strings $a^{+}_ i$ and $a^{-}_ i$, representing what a + and a - can be encoded as, respectively. If the string is empty, print instead <empty>, and if the string can be anything, print <any>. If there are multiple answers, you can output them in any order. If there is no valid answer, write corrupted instead. -----Limits-----  - $1 \leq |I|, |O| \leq 280$  - $I$ and $O$ contain only the lowercase letters a-z, 0-9, + and - -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: a+b-c a-b+d-c Sample Output 1: - +d- Sample Input 2: knuth-morris-pratt knuthmorrispratt Sample Output 2: <any> <empty>
