 You are given an $n \times m$ chessboard. You can place at most $n$ queens on the board. In how many ways can you place a maximum number of queens on the board? 
-----Input----- The first line has two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 50, n \cdot m \leq 50$), describing the size of the chessboard. Each of the next $n$ lines has $m$ characters describing the cells on one row of the chess board. A dot (‘.’) denotes an empty cell, while a hash (‘#’) denotes a broken cell. There is at least one usable cell on the chessboard. -----Output----- Output two integers. The first is the maximum number of queens Zapray can place on the chessboard, and the second is the number of ways in which he can place that many queens. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 4 .... .#.# .... Sample Output: 5 13
