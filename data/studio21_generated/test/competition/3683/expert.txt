 You are given a list of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $p$ and $h$, where $p$ ($2 \le p \le 500$) is the number of players and $h$ ($1 \le h \le 50$) is the number of holes. The next $p$ lines each contain $h$ positive integers. The $j^{\text {th}}$ number on the $i^{\text {th}}$ of these lines is the score for player $i$ on hole $j$, and does not exceed $10^9$. -----Output----- Output a line with the minimum possible rank for each player, in the same order as players are listed in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 2 2 2 4 2 1 4 4 1 Sample Output: 1 2 2
