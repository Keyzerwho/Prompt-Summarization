 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line containing an integer $f$ ($0 \leq f \leq 10^5$), the number of Nudgémon families;  - $f$ lines describing a family of Nudgémon, where each line consists of the following elements:  - an integer $s_ i$ ($1 \le s_ i \leq 10^5$), the number of Nudgémon in this family;  - $s_ i-1$ times the name of a Nudgémon, followed by an integer $c_ j$ ($1 \le c_ j \leq 10^5$), the amount of candies (of appropriate type) consumed by evolving this Nudgémon;  - the name of the strongest Nudgémon in this family;  - one line containing an integer $n$ ($0 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$), the number of Nudgémon your friend caught;  - $n$ lines containing an integer $t_ i$ ($0 \leq t_ i \leq 10^9$) and a string $p_ i$, the time at which the Nudgémon was caught and the name of the caught Nudgémon. It is guaranteed that there are at most $10^5$ Nudgémon kinds ($\sum _{i} s_ i \leq 10^5$). The Nudgémon in each family are given in order of increasing rank, and thus the values of $c$ in one family are non-decreasing. Every Nudgémon name is a string of between $1$ and $20$ lowercase letters. The times $t_ i$ are non-decreasing (your friend is so quick he can catch multiple Nudgémon in a single second). No Nudgémon name appears more than once within a family or within more than one family, and all $n$ Nudgémon that are caught belong to one of the families. -----Output----- Output the maximum amount of XP your friend could have had at the current time had he activated his Blessed Egg at the optimal time and only evolved Nudgémon during the time it was active. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 caterpillar 3 pupa 7 butterfly 3 dove 3 pigeon 7 aaabaaajss 3 mouse 1 electromouse 5 rat 7 0 electromouse 500 electromouse 1000 electromouse 1500 rat 2000 aaabaaajss 2500 pigeon 3000 butterfly Sample Output: 5100
