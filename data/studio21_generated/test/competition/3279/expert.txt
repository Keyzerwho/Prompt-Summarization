 You are given a string. Find a marking that is consistent with the given specification. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($0 < n \le 9$). This is followed by $n$ lines. The $i^{\text {th}}$ line contains $1$ or more non-negative integers denoting the sizes of groups that must be formed by the vertical bars in row $i$ (counting from the top). If the line contains the single integer $0$, then no borders may be marked for that row. Otherwise, none of the integers on the line will be $0$. Following that will be another $n$ lines. The $j^{\text {th}}$ line contains $1$ or more non-negative integers denoting the sizes of groups that must be formed by the horizontal bars in column $j$ (counting from the left). If the line contains the single integer $0$, then no borders may be marked for that column. Otherwise, none of the integers on the line will be $0$. -----Output----- Output the solution as follows. On the first $n$ lines, output a string of length $n+1$ consisting of 1 and 0 characters. The $i^{\text {th}}$ string should contain a 1 in position $j$ if and only if the $j^{\text {th}}$ vertical border in row $i$ should be marked as a bar. On the next $n+1$ lines, output a string of length $n$ also consisting of 1 and 0 characters. The $i^{\text {th}}$ string should contain a 1 in position $j$ if and only if the $i^{\text {th}}$ horizontal border in column $j$ should be marked as a bar. Rows are counted top down and columns are counted left to right. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them! You may assume that at least one marking exists that is consistent with the specification. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 0 0 3 Sample Output 1: 100 000 01 01 01 Sample Input 2: 3 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 2: 0000 1001 0010 101 010 000 100
