 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. The first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with two integers $w$ ($1 \le w \le 1000$), the number of wells, and $p$ ($1 \le p \le 1000$), the number of pipes;  - $w$ lines, the $i$th of which contains two integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ ($-10000 \le x, y \le 10000$), the position of well number $i$ (the wells are numbered from $1$ to $w$);  - $p$ lines each with three integers $s$ ($1 \le s \leq w$), the well at which the pipe starts, and $x$ and $y$ ($-10000 \le x, y \le 10000$), the position at which the pipe ends. Each pipe will contain exactly one well, the one at which it starts. Any point shared by more than two pipes will be a well. Any two pipes share at most one common point. The common point of two pipes may be the endpoint of one or both of them. All pipes have positive length. -----Output----- If it is possible to clean all intersections as described above, output “possible”. Otherwise, output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 1 2 3 2 2 2 3 0 3 Sample Output: impossible
