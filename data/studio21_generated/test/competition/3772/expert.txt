 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The single input line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^18). It is guaranteed that the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ is irreducible. It is guaranteed that a solution always exists. -----Output----- Print a single number — the answer to the problem. Please do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is recommended to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 2 Output 3 Input 199 200 Output 200 -----Note----- In the first sample, one resistor is enough. In the second sample one can connect the resistors in parallel, take the resulting element and connect it to a third resistor consecutively. Then, we get an element with resistance $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1}} + 1 = \frac{3}{2}$. We cannot make this element using two resistors.
