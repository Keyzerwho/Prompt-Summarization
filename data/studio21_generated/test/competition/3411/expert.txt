 You are given a list of comments. You need to find if comment chain is alternating.
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with three integers $n$, $c$, and $r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq c,r \leq 10^9$), the number of comments in the chain, the time it takes to create a fake account and the time it takes to report one comment respectively.  - One line with $n$ integers $s_1, \ldots , s_ n$ ($-10^9 \leq s_ i \leq 10^9$ for all $i$), the current score of each comment in the chain. -----Output----- Output the smallest time to make the comment chain alternating by applying the operations above. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 10 50 8 8 2 -2 Sample Output: 80
