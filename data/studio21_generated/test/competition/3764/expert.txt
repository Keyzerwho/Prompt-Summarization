 You are given an array of numbers. Find the maximum and minimum number after performing some operation. 
-----Input----- First line consists of three integers n, k, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^3) — number of rangers Jon has, the number of times Jon will carry out the operation and Jon's favourite number respectively. Second line consists of n integers representing the strengths of the rangers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3). -----Output----- Output two integers, the maximum and the minimum strength of the rangers after performing the operation k times. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 9 7 11 15 5 Output 13 7 Input 2 100000 569 605 986 Output 986 605
