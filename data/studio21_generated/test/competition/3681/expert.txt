-----Input----- The first line contains $3$ integers: $N$, $M$ and $Q$ - the number of queries ($1 \leq N,M,Q \leq 10^5$). The next $Q$ lines describes $Q$ queries, each will be in either of the $2$ forms:  - $0$ $K$ $x$ $p_1$ $p_2$ â€¦$p_ K$ - add a plan to rotate $K$ teachers $p_1, p_2, \ldots p_ K$ on Monday of the $x$-th week ($1 \leq x \leq M$, $2 \leq K \leq 10$, all $K$ values in $p$ are unique).  - $1$ $d$ $x$ - ask which class is taught by teacher $d$ on Tuesday of the $x$-th week. It is guaranteed that there are no two queries of type $0$ has the same value $x$. -----Output----- For each of the queries type $1$, print the answer in a single line. -----Clarification for the second sample----- Initial assignment:  Class $1$ Class $2$ Class $3$ Week $1$ $1$ $2$ $3$ Week $2$ $1$ $2$ $3$ Week $3$ $1$ $2$ $3$ Week $4$ $1$ $2$ $3$ After rotate $(3, 2)$ on Monday of the $2^\textrm {nd}$ week:  Class $1$ Class $2$ Class $3$ Week $1$ $1$ $2$ $3$ Week $2$ $1$ $3$ $2$ Week $3$ $1$ $3$ $2$ Week $4$ $1$ $3$ $2$ After rotate $(3,1,2)$ on Monday of the $3^\textrm {rd}$ week:  Class $1$ Class $2$ Class $3$ Week $1$ $1$ $2$ $3$ Week $2$ $1$ $3$ $2$ Week $3$ $3$ $2$ $1$ Week $4$ $3$ $2$ $1$ -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 4 5 1 3 4 0 2 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 2 4 1 1 4 Sample Output: 3 2 3 1
