 You are given a coordinate plane and $N$ nails. Each nail is given with $x$ and $y$ coordinates. You can remove the nail from the board. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer $N$ $(3 \leq N \leq 300000)$, the number of nails. Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers separated by a space, the coordinates of a nail. All coordinates will be between 1 and $1000000000$. No two nails will share the same $x$- or $y$-coordinate. The next line contains $N-2$ letters ’L’, ’R’, ’U’ or ’D’. The letters represent the nails Mirko picked in order:  - ’L’ for the leftmost nail (smallest $x$-coordinate),  - ’R’ for the rightmost nail (largest $x$-coordinate),  - ’U’ for the topmost nail (largest $y$-coordinate),  - ’D’ for the bottommost nail (smallest $y$-coordinate). -----Output----- Output $N-2$ numbers, each on a separate line. The numbers are, in order, the areas that Mirko wrote down. Output numbers with one digit after the decimal point. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1 4 2 2 4 1 3 5 5 3 LUR Sample Output: 9.0 6.5 2.5
