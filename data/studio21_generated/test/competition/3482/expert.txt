 Given two dates, a transit card charging scheme, and a list of days you will be away, your task is to determine the cheapest option to charge the transit card. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $1 \le l \le 100$, the number of price levels for the transit card. Then follows a line containing $l$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots , p_{l}$, where $1 \le p_ i \le 1000$ is the price per day at the $i^\textrm {th}$ price level. The next line contains $l-1$ integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots , d_{l-1}$, where $1 \le d_ i \le 10^6$ indicates how many days the $i^\textrm {th}$ price level is active. Thus for example the third price level $p_3$ becomes active after $d_1 + d_2$ days. The last price level is active indefinitely. You may assume that the prices are monotonically decreasing, i.e., $p_1 > p_2 > \ldots > p_ l$. The fourth line of input contains two integers $t$ and $n$, where $1 \le t \le 10^6$ is the total number of days for which you want to buy a transit pass, and $0 \le n \le 5000$ is the number of trips home you make during this period. After this follow $n$ lines, each containing two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a \le b \le t$), indicating that you will be away on all days from day $a$ to day $b$ (inclusive). The days are numbered from $1$ to $t$. You may assume that the trips home are listed in chronological order and that they do not overlap. -----Output----- Output the smallest total cost of your transit card for the $t$ days. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 20 15 10 7 7 30 0 Sample Output: 405
