 You are given two networks. You need to connect them using as few cables as possible. 
-----Input----- On the first line, you are given two positive integers, the number $1 \leq c \leq 10^5$ of computers and the number $0 \leq \ell \leq c-1$ of existing cables. Then follow $\ell $ lines, each line consisting of two distinct integers $a$ and $b$, the two computers the cables connect. You may assume that every computer has a unique name between $0$ and $c-1$. -----Output----- The maximum number of hops in the resulting network. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 4 0 1 0 2 3 4 3 5 Sample Output: 3
