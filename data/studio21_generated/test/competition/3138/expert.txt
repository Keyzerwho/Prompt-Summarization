 You are given an arithmetic practice book with $n$ pages. Each page has a positive integer on it. You need to find in how many ways you can assign the range $[1, 10]$ of consecutive pages to Sarah and Patricia. 
-----Input----- The input has a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) on the first line. The second line has $n$ positive integers giving the numbers in the arithmetic practice book ordered by the pages. None of these integers are larger than $10^9$. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the number of ways for Marguerite to choose a range of at least two consecutive pages so that Sarah’s answer matches Patricia’s. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 2 2 1 2 3 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 8 1 2 4 1 1 2 5 1 Sample Output 2: 4
