 Given an array $A$ of $N$ non-negative integers, return $K$ such that $A$ is $K_S$-smooth.
-----Input----- The first line of input will consist of three integers of the form:\[ N\; \; K\; \; S \] where $N$ is the size of the array, The remainder of the file will consist of $N$ integers, $a_ n\in A$, separated by white space. All input will be within the following constraints:\[ 1 \le K \le N \le 5000 \]\[ \forall a_ n \in A,\; 0 \le a_ n \le S \le 5000 \] -----Output----- Your program must output a single integer specifying the minimum number of changes that must be made in order to make the array $K_ S$ smooth. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 5 1 2 3 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 6 3 5 1 2 3 3 2 1 Sample Output 2: 3
