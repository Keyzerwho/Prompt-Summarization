 # Task  Given two rooms, determine the distance between them after reconstruction. # 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 300000$), the number of rooms. The rooms are numbered $1$ to $N$. Each of the next $N-1$ lines contains two integers, the numbers of rooms a tunnel connects. -----Output----- Output on separate lines, in order:  - The distance between the two farthest rooms after reconstruction.  - A pair of integers representing a previously existing tunnel, which should be closed.  - A pair of integers, the rooms between which a new tunnel should be opened. Note: The solution will not necessarily be unique. Output any reconstruction plan which achieves the smallest distance between the farthest two rooms. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 Sample Output: 2 3 4 4 2
