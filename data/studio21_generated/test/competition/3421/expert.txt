 You are given a sequence of test results and a number $k$. Your task is to find a continuous subsequence of length at least $k$ which has the highest possible success rate among all such subsequences. The success rate of a subsequence is defined as the number of successfully classified e-mails divided by the length of the subsequence. 
-----Input description----- On the first line there is an integer $k$ ($1\le k \le 100$) denoting the minimal subsequence length. The second line contains a string consisting of characters 0 and 1, denoting answers of the program for each e-mail in the database. Number 1 indicates that Gooâ€™s program gave a correct answer and 0 that it failed. The length of the string will be at least $k$ and at most $100000$ characters. -----Output description----- The first and only line of output should consist of two integers $f$ and $\ell $, separated by a single space. The integer $f$ is the 1-based index of the first element of subsequence with the best success rate and $\ell $ is its length. If there are multiple optimal solutions, you can output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 01 Sample Output: 2 1
