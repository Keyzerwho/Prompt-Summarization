 You are given N different numbers. You want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \leq k \leq n \leq 200000$), representing the number of trees in the row and the number of trees Andy needs to buy, respectively. The second line consists of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$ where $1 \leq a_ i \leq 100$, representing the height of each tree. -----Output----- Output the minimum height difference between the shortest and tallest trees of any contiguous subrange of $k$ trees. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10 2 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 16 Sample Output: 1
