 Given an 2 dimentional array, count number of intersections in it. Intersections are represented by 'X' and empty slots are represented with "."s. Intersections can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent intersections. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $k$ ($0 \leq k \leq 15$), giving the number of drones to position. Then follows one line with $1 \leq n \leq 100\; 000$, the total number of intersections in Basin City. Finally followÂ $n$ lines describing consecutive intersections. The $i$-th line describes the $i$-th intersection in the following format: The line starts with one integer $d$ ($0 \leq d \leq 4$) describing the number of intersections neighbouring the $i$-th one. Then follow $d$ integers denoting the indices of these neighbouring intersections. They will be all distinct and different from $i$. The intersections are numbered from $1$ to $n$. -----Output----- If it is possible to position $k$ drones such that no two neighbouring intersections have been assigned a drone, output a single line containing possible. Otherwise, output a single line containing impossible. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 7 2 2 4 3 1 3 5 1 2 2 1 5 4 2 6 4 7 2 5 7 2 6 5 Sample Output: impossible
