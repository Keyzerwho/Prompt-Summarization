 Given a list of card types and the number of types of envelopes you can buy, what is the smallest amount of wasted paper you can achieve   
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of the input will consist of two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n,k \le 15$), where $n$ is the number of different types of cards, and $k$ is the maximum number of types of envelopes you can order. Each of the following $n$ lines will consist of three integers, describing a type of card. The integers are $w$, $h$ and $q$ ($1 \le w,h,q \le 10000$), where $w$ is the width of the cards of this type, $h$ is the height of the cards, and $q$ is the quantity of cards of this type. -----Output----- Output a single integer, representing the smallest possible total amount of wasted paper. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 1 10 10 5 9 8 10 4 12 20 12 4 8 2 3 16 Sample Output 1: 5836 Sample Input 2: 5 2 10 10 5 9 8 10 4 12 20 12 4 8 2 3 16 Sample Output 2: 1828
