 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- Input starts with a line with an integer $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$, the number of boxes in Johanâ€™s kitchen and a floating point number $0 \leq P \leq 1$, the minimum probability with which Johan wants to find Polly. Then $N$ lines follow: each line containing an integer $0 \leq e_ i \leq 10^3$ describing the amount of energy needed to open box $i$, and a floating point number $0 \leq p_ i \leq 1$ describing the probability that Polly is inside box number $i$. All probabilities are given with at most four digits after the decimal point. -----Output----- Output should contain a single integer on a single line: the minimum amount of energy Johan has to waste while finding Polly with at least probability $P$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 0.5 2 0.5 1 0.5 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 2 0.5 2 0.51 1 0.49 Sample Output 2: 2
