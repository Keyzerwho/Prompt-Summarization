 Luka reads the numbers off of $N$ license plates and writes them down on a piece of paper. Then he tries to find an integer $M$ greater than $1$ such that all integers on the paper give the same remainder when divided by $M$. Luka tries to find as many such integers $M$ as possible. Write a program that, given Luka s $N$ integers, determines all such integers $M$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 100$), the number of integers on paper. Each of the following $N$ lines contains one integer between $1$ and $1000000000$ (one billion). All these integers will be distinct. The input data will guarantee that at least one integer $M$ will always exist. -----Output----- Output all integers $M$ separated by spaces, in any order. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 6 34 38 Sample Output: 2 4
