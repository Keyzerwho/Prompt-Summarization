 You are given a secret ID, which is a binary string of length $n$. Your task is to return the number of spies the agency can employ. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains one integer $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq 50)$ — the length of a valid ID.  - The second line contains a string of at most $30$ characters 1 and *, where at least half of them are 1s — the pattern $P$ which all valid IDs must satisfy. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of members in the agency, if each is assigned a unique valid ID. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10 1 Sample Output: 1023
