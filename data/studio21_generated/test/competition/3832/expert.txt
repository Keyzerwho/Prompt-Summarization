 You are given n integers. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000)—the number of the hills in the sequence. Second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100 000)—the heights of the hills in the sequence. -----Output----- Print exactly $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ numbers separated by spaces. The i-th printed number should be equal to the minimum number of hours required to level hills so it becomes possible to build i houses. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output 1 2 2  Input 3 1 2 3 Output 0 2  Input 5 1 2 3 2 2 Output 0 1 3  -----Note----- In the first example, to get at least one hill suitable for construction, one can decrease the second hill by one in one hour, then the sequence of heights becomes 1, 0, 1, 1, 1 and the first hill becomes suitable for construction. In the first example, to get at least two or at least three suitable hills, one can decrease the second and the fourth hills, then the sequence of heights becomes 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, and hills 1, 3, 5 become suitable for construction.
