 You are given two positive integers x and y. You have to perform addition operation on them, and erase one of them. 
-----Input----- Single line of the input contains three integers x, y and m ( - 10^18 ≤ x, y, m ≤ 10^18). Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preffered to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of operations or "-1" (without quotes), if it is impossible to transform the given pair to the m-perfect one. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 5 Output 2 Input -1 4 15 Output 4 Input 0 -1 5 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample the following sequence of operations is suitable: (1, 2) $\rightarrow$ (3, 2) $\rightarrow$ (5, 2). In the second sample: (-1, 4) $\rightarrow$ (3, 4) $\rightarrow$ (7, 4) $\rightarrow$ (11, 4) $\rightarrow$ (15, 4). Finally, in the third sample x, y cannot be made positive, hence there is no proper sequence of operations.
