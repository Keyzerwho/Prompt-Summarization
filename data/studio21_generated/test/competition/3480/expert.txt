 Given a round, your task is to display the round so that syllables that are sung simultaneously in the two voices appear vertically aligned. For each line of the original input, there are to be two lines of output: one for the original line sung by the first voice and one to display syllables (if any) that are started by the second voice during the time period where the first voice is singing the indicated line. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, $L$ and $D$, such that $1 \leq L \leq 10$ indicates the number of lines in the song and $0 \leq D \leq 128$ indicates the delay, in time units, between the time when the first voice signs the first syllable and the time when the second voice begins singing the first syllable. The remainder of the input consists of $L$ pairs of lines. The first line in each pair contains the syllables of that line of the song. Adjacent syllables in the input will be separated by a single space The syllables are strings of any non-whitespace characters other than underscores or ’/’. This line contains at most 80 characters. The second line in each pair will consist of positive integers, one per syllable from the first line of the pair, indicating the time allocated to the corresponding syllables. Each such integer $t$ will satisfy $1 \leq t \leq 128$. -----Output----- For each dataset, display $2L$ lines corresponding to the two voices in the round, as described above. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 16 Hot cross buns! = Hot cross buns! = 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 One a pen- ny, Two a pen- ny, Hot cross buns! = 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 4 Sample Output: Hot_cross_buns!_=___Hot_cross_buns!_= ____________________Hot_cross_buns!_= One_a_pen-_ny,_Two_a_pen-_ny,_Hot___cross____buns!_= Hot___cross____buns!_=________One_a_pen-_ny,_Two_a_pen-_ny,
