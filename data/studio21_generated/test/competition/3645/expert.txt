 You are given a circle $n$ pieces of paper, each labelled with an integer. Alf starts by choosing an integer $x$ that appears on some piece of paper. Beata then tries to figure out what this integer is by asking a series of questions. In each question, Beata picks an integer $y$ that appears on a piece of paper and asks if $y$ is closest to $x$ on the circle when going clockwise or counter-clockwise (measured in the number of pieces of paper between them). If both directions give the same distance, for instance if $y = x$, Alf can choose which one of the two possible answers to provide. 


-----Input----- The first line of integers contains $n$ ($2 \le n \le 15000$), the number of pieces of paper in the circle. The next line contains $n$ integers, the integers written on the pieces of paper, each between $1$ and $15000$. They are given clockwise in the order they appear on the circle, and are not necessarily unique. -----Output----- Output all integers $x$ that Alf can choose in the game such that given enough guesses, Beata can uniquely determine the value of $x$. List these values in increasing order. If there is no such integer $x$, output “none”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 2 3 Sample Output 1: 1 2 3 Sample Input 2: 3 1 1 2 Sample Output 2: none Sample Input 3: 4 1 2 1 3 Sample Output 3: none
