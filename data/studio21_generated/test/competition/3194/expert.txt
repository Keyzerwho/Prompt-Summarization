-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^4$) and $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$), where $n$ is the number of desired photographs and $t$ is the time you spend to take each photograph. Following that are $n$ additional lines, each describing the available time period for one of the photographs. Each such line contains two nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$, where $a$ is the earliest time that you may begin working on that photograph, and $b$ is the time by which the photograph must be completed, with $a + t \leq b \leq 10^9$. -----Output----- Display yes if it is possible to take all $n$ photographs, and no otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 10 0 15 5 20 Sample Output 1: yes Sample Input 2: 2 10 1 15 0 20 Sample Output 2: no
