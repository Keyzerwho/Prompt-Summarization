 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100000$), the number of citizens;  - $n$ lines each with two integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \leq x,y \leq 10^9$), the coordinates of each citizen’s house;  - one line with one integer $d$ ($0 \leq d \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$), the maximum distance that each citizen should have to travel. It is possible for multiple citizens to live at the same intersection. -----Output----- Output one line with a single integer: the smallest possible total distance that all citizens need to travel. If there is no intersection that everyone lives within a distance $d$ of, output “impossible” instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 10 Sample Output 1: 18 Sample Input 2: 5 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 Sample Output 2: 20
