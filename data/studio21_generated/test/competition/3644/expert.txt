 You are given an array of $n$ integers. The array contains information about how many workers are needed each day for the foreseeable future. Using this information, Amazin Inc can adjust the size of its workforce on a day-to-day basis by firing and/or hiring workers so that they always have exactly as many as are needed each day. The firing of workers must follow a last-in-first-out order. Furthermore, a fired person cannot be re-hired within the foreseeable future so it is not possible to circumvent the law by firing some people and then immediately re-hiring some of them. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), the length in days of the foreseeable future. Then follow $n$ lines, the $i$th of which contains two integers $f_ i$ and $h_ i$ ($0 \le f_ i, h_ i \le 10^6$) where $f_ i$ is the number of workers fired on day $i$ and $h_ i$ the number of people hired. The number of workers fired on a day is never larger than the number of currently employed workers (in other words, $f_ i \le \sum _{j=0}^{i-1} h_ j-f_ j$ for all $1 \le i \le n$). -----Output----- Output a line with an integer $k$, the smallest number of HR people needed. The HR people are arbitrarily given IDs from $1$ to $k$. Then output a line with $n$ integers, the $i$th of which contains the ID of the HR person in charge of the firing and hiring on day $i$. If there is more than one solution, any one will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 0 3 1 1 2 1 2 0 Sample Output: 3 1 2 3 2
