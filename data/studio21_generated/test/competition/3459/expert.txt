 You are given an array of integers representing the number of residents in the town. Each integer represents the number of residents who belong to a club. Each integer represents the number of residents who belong to a political party. 
-----Input----- In the first line of input there will be an integer $T \le 12$, giving the number of test cases. Each of the $T$ testcases begins with a line with the number of residents $n$, $1 \leq n \leq 1000$. The next $n$ lines each contain a resident, a party, the number of clubs the resident belongs to (at most $110$) and the names of such clubs. Each resident appears in exactly one input line. -----Output----- For each test case, follow the following format: Each line should name a council member followed by the club represented by the member. If several answers are possible, any will do. If no council can be formed, print “Impossible.” in a line. There will be a blank line in between two test cases. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 4 fred dinosaur 2 jets jetsons john rhinocerous 2 jets rockets mary rhinocerous 2 jetsons rockets ruth platypus 1 rockets 4 fred dinosaur 2 jets jetsons john rhinocerous 2 jets rockets mary rhinocerous 2 jetsons rockets ruth platypus 1 rockets Sample Output: fred jetsons john jets ruth rockets fred jetsons john jets ruth rockets
