 You are given a set of service history entries, each consisting of a date, a distance, and a time. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $1 \le e \le 500$, the number of entries in the service history. Next follow $e$ lines that describe the entries in the service history. Each such entry is given by three integers $y$, $m$, $o$, where $1950 \le y \le 2050$ and $1 \le m \le 12$ is the year and month of the service (respectively), and $0 \le o \le 99999$ is the reading of the odometer for that entry. The service entries are given in chronological order from oldest to most recent. The first service entry represents the purchase of the car when it was brand new and has $o=0$ (but the previous owner may still have travelled some or all of the distance for that month prior to buying the car). There may be multiple service entries in the same month (but they are still given in chronological order). -----Output----- If it can be conclusively proven that the odometer must have been tampered with, output “tampered odometer”. Otherwise, if, assuming the odometer was not tampered with, the car can not have been serviced often enough, output “insufficient service”. Otherwise, output “seems legit”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2017 4 0 2017 8 12000 2018 8 42000 Sample Output 1: seems legit Sample Input 2: 3 2017 4 0 2017 8 12000 2018 8 42001 Sample Output 2: insufficient service Sample Input 3: 2 2017 11 0 2018 1 1000 Sample Output 3: tampered odometer Sample Input 4: 2 2013 1 0 2013 2 0 Sample Output 4: seems legit
