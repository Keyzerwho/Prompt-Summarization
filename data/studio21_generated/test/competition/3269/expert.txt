 You are given two integers $A$ and $B$. Calculate the sum of distances between each pair of numbers belonging in the interval $[A, B]$. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains integers $A$, $B$ ($1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{50000}$). -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required number from the text. Given that the number could be extremely large, output the answer modulo $1000000007$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 5 Sample Output 1: 40 Sample Input 2: 288 291 Sample Output 2: 76
