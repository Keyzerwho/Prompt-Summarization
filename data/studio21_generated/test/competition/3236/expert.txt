 Given two positive integers $n$ and $m$, output the maximum length of a Fibonacci Tour. 
-----Input----- The first line has two integers $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 10^5$) and $m$ ($0\leq m\leq 10^5$), giving the number of mansions and the number of roads in the city. The next line has $n$ positive integers no larger than $10^{18}$. The $i$-th integer gives the height of mansion $i$. The next $m$ lines each has two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1\leq a, b \leq n$, $a \neq b$), indicating that there is a bi-directional road between mansion $a$ and mansion $b$. Each pair of mansions is directly connected by at most one road. -----Output----- Output the length of the longest Fibonacci Tour Charles can take in the city. If there is no tour Charles can take, output zero. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 6 1 3 2 1 5 1 3 2 3 1 4 3 5 4 5 2 5 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 4 3 4 4 8 12 1 2 2 3 3 4 Sample Output 2: 1
