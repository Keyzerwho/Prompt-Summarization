  You are given two integer arrays $A$ and $B$, each containing $n$ elements. For each element of $A$, you want to know the live duration of the corresponding element of $B$. In other words, for each element of $A$, you want to know the number of allergic reaction examinations it will cause. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 20$) specifying the number of allergens being tested for. Then follow $k$ lines each containing an integer $D$ ($1 \leq D \leq 7$) specifying the live duration of each allergen. -----Output----- The number of days of the shortest conclusive non-adaptive test scheme. A scheme ends the morning when you no longer have active allergens in your body, thus a test scheme for a single allergen with live duration $D$ takes $D$ days. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 2 2 2 Sample Output: 5
