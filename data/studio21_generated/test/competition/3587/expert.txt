 You are given $N$ taboo strings $s_1, \dots , s_ N$. What is the longest clue string $s$ such that none of $s_1, \dots , s_ N$ appears as a substring of $s$ 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer, $N$, the number of taboo strings ($1 \leq N \leq 15000$). The following $N$ lines each contains a non-empty binary string $s_ i$, for $1 \leq i \leq N$. The sum of lengths of $s_1, \dots , s_ N$ will be at most $200000$. -----Output----- If your clue can be arbitrarily long, output -1. Otherwise, output a line containing the longest binary string that does not contain $s_1, \dots , s_ N$ as a substring. If there is more than one such longest string, output the one that is also smallest in lexicographic order. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 00 01 10 110 111 Sample Output: 11
