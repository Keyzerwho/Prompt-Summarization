 You are given a number of tiles $n$. You need to find the length of the side of the building $m$ and and the length of the side of the pool $k$ such that $n=m^2-k^2$, or print impossible if no suitable $m$ and $k$ exist. 
-----Input-----  - One line containing a single integer $1\leq n\leq 10^9$. -----Output----- Print two non-negative integers $m$, $k$ such that $n = m^2 - k^2$, or print impossible if no such integers exist. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 Sample Output 1: 4 3 Sample Input 2: 10 Sample Output 2: impossible
