 Given an integer N and four characters c_{\mathrm{AA}}, c_{\mathrm{AB}}, c_{\mathrm{BA}}, and c_{\mathrm{BB}}. Find the number, modulo (10^9+7), of strings that can be s when Snuke has done the operations so that the length of s becomes N.
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N c_{\mathrm{AA}} c_{\mathrm{AB}} c_{\mathrm{BA}} c_{\mathrm{BB}} -----Output----- Print the number, modulo (10^9+7), of strings that can be s when Snuke has done the operations so that the length of s becomes N. -----Sample Input----- 4 A B B A -----Sample Output----- 2  - There are two strings that can be s when Snuke is done: ABAB and ABBB.
