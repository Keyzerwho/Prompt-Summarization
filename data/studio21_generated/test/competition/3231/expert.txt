 You are given a list of students. You need to output true if the students are telling the truth, false otherwise. 
-----Input----- First a single line with three non-negative integers $n$, $p$ and $q$ as described above. Next follow $n$ lines, one for each student, starting with student $i=0$. Each such line starts with an integer $m_ i$, denoting the number of friends student number $i$ claims that she has. Then follow $m_ i$ distinct integers between $0$ and $n-1$, indicating who those friends are (the students are numbered from $0$ to $n-1$). We always have $1 \leq n \leq 2500$, and $p + q \leq 15$. Furthermore, it is guaranteed that $m_0 + m_1 + \ldots + m_{n-1} \leq 30000$. A student never lists herself as one of her friends. -----Output----- If Dolores can be certain someone did’t tell the truth, output “detention”. Otherwise, output “home”. If you output home on the first line, then you should prove your claim by outputting a partition of the students into groups such that the requirements above hold (if there are several, any one will do): The second line should then contain a positive integer $G$, the number of groups. The following $G$ lines should each begin with a positive integer $g_ i$, the number of students in the $i$-th group. Then on the same line, $g_ i$ integers indicating the students in this group. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 2 1 1 1 2 0 2 2 1 3 1 2 Sample Output 1: home 2 2 0 1 2 2 3 Sample Input 2: 5 2 1 1 1 2 0 2 2 1 3 2 2 4 1 3 Sample Output 2: detention
