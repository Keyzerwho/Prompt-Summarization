 You are given a list of $n$ letters, where $n$ is the number of letters in the alphabet. For each encrypted message, you are given a list of $m$ letters. For each position, you must find the number of positions where the fragment matches. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with a string consisting of at least $1$ and at most $250000$ lowercase letters, the encrypted message;  - one line with a string consisting of at least $1$ and at most $250000$ lowercase letters, the decrypted fragment. -----Output----- If there is a unique position in the encrypted message where the message fragment could occur, output the substring of the encrypted message that could correspond to the fragment. Otherwise, output the number of positions in the encrypted message where the fragment could occur. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: secretmessage boot Sample Output 1: essa Sample Input 2: treetreetreetree wood Sample Output 2: 3 Sample Input 3: oranges apples Sample Output 3: 0
