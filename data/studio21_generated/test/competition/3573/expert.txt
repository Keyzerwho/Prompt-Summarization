 You are given a number $N$ of balls, a number $D$ of balls they draw from the box in each round, the amount $C$ of numbers in their cards and the numbers they wrote down, find the expected number of rounds the game will last. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input consists of three space separated integers: $N$, $D$, and $C$. $N$ is the number of balls, $D$ is the number of balls drawn in each round, and $C$ is the cards’ size. Each of the following two lines contains $C$ space separated integers: the numbers Cesar and Raul wrote down, respectively. -----Constraints----- $1$ $\leq $ $N$ $\leq $ $50$ Number of balls in the box $1$ $\leq $ $D$ $\leq $ $\min (10, N)$ Number of balls drawn in each round $1$ $\leq $ $C$ $\leq $ $\min (10, N)$ Cards’ sizeOutput The output is the expected number of rounds of the game. The result will be considered correct as long as the absolute error does not exceed $10^{-3}$. -----Explanation for Sample Input 1----- There are $2$ balls. Cesar picked number $1$ and Raul picked number $2$. In the first round, either number $1$ or $2$ will be drawn and so one of them wins right away. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 1 1 2 Sample Output: 1.00000000
