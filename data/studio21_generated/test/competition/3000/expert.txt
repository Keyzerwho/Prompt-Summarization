 
-----Input-----  - One line containing a single integer $1\leq n\leq 3\cdot 10^5$.  - One line consisting of $n$ tokens, each being either (, ), or an integer $0\leq x < 10^9+7$. It is guaranteed that the tokens form a bracket sequence. -----Output----- Output the value of the given bracket sequence. Since this may be very large, you should print it modulo $10^9+7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 2 3 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 8 ( 2 ( 2 1 ) ) 3 Sample Output 2: 9 Sample Input 3: 4 ( 12 3 ) Sample Output 3: 36 Sample Input 4: 6 ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Sample Output 4: 5 Sample Input 5: 6 ( ( 2 3 ) ) Sample Output 5: 5
