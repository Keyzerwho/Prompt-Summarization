 You are given an $n$ by $n$ grid of integers. Each integer represents the number of hours for which a building is in the sun. For example, 3 represents 12 hours, 4 represents 24 hours, 5 represents 36 hours, 6 represents 48 hours, 7 represents 60 hours, 8 represents 72 hours, 9 represents 84 hours, 10 represents 96 hours, 11 represents 108 hours, 12 represents 120 hours. 
-----Input-----  - One line containing one integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$): the number of buildings.  - $N$ further lines each containing two space-separated integers $X_ i$ and $H_ i$ ($1 \leq X, H \leq 10^9$), the location and height respectively, in metres, of the $i^{th}$-most building from the west. -----Output----- On each of the $N$ lines of output, write one real number to at least 4 decimal places of accuracy: the number of hours for which the peak of the $i$-th building is bathed in sunlight. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 Sample Output: 9.0000 12 12.00000 9.0
