 You are given two integers n and m, and m brightness levels. You are asked to find the number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons when x is set to minimize this number. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: n m a_1 a_2 â€¦ a_n -----Output----- Print the minimum number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons. -----Sample Input----- 4 6 1 5 1 4 -----Sample Output----- 5 When the favorite brightness level is set to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Snuke needs to press the buttons 8, 9, 7, 5, 6 and 9 times, respectively. Thus, Snuke should set the favorite brightness level to 4.
