 Consider a row of n integers. The element with the largest value occurs first. The element with the largest value occurs last. The element with the second-greatest value occurs second-last. The element with the second-greatest value occurs third-last. The element with the third-greatest value occurs last. The element with the third-greatest value occurs second-last. The element with the second-greatest value occurs first. The element with the second-greatest value occurs second-last. The element with the third-greatest value occurs third-last. The element with the third-greatest value occurs last. The element with the third-greatest value occurs second-last. The element with the second-greatest value occurs first. The element with the second-greatest value occurs first. The element with the third-greatest value occurs last. The element with the third-greatest value occurs second-last. The element with the second-greatest value occurs first. The element with the second-greatest value occurs first. The element with the third-greatest value occurs last. The element with the third-greatest
-----Input----- The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000). The second line contains k space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^12). -----Output----- Print a single word "YES", if the given sequence occurs in table G, otherwise print "NO". -----Examples----- Input 100 100 5 5 2 1 2 1 Output YES Input 100 8 5 5 2 1 2 1 Output NO Input 100 100 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Output NO -----Note----- Sample 1. The tenth row of table G starts from sequence {1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1, 10}. As you can see, elements from fifth to ninth coincide with sequence a. Sample 2. This time the width of table G equals 8. Sequence a doesn't occur there.
