 You are given the dimensions of the board and the number of squares. You need to write a program to calculate the number of grey squares visited by the hedgehog in $K$ steps. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $R$ ($1 \le R \le 1000000$) and $C$ ($1 \le C \le 1000000$), the dimensions of the board. The second line contains the integer $K$ ($1 \le K \le R \cdot C$), the total number of squares the hedgehog visits. Note that this number may not fit in a 32-bit integer. -----Output----- Output the number of grey cells the hedgehog visits. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 10 6 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 3 5 11 Sample Output 2: 8
