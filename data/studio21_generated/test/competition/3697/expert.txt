 You are given a set of n candidates, they are numbered from 1 to n. For each candidate, you have to determine one of the three possible outcomes. 
-----Input----- The first line contains four integers n, k, m and a (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ m) — the number of candidates, the number of seats in the parliament, the number of Berland citizens and the number of citizens who already have voted. The second line contains a sequence of a integers g_1, g_2, ..., g_{a} (1 ≤ g_{j} ≤ n), where g_{j} is the candidate for which the j-th citizen has voted. Citizens who already voted are numbered in increasing order of voting times. -----Output----- Print the sequence consisting of n integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n} where:   r_{i} = 1 means that the i-th candidate is guaranteed to take seat in the parliament regardless of votes of the remaining m - a citizens;  r_{i} = 2 means that the i-th candidate has a chance to take a seat in the parliament, i.e. the remaining m - a citizens can vote in such a way that the candidate will take a seat in the parliament;  r_{i} = 3 means that the i-th candidate will not take a seat in the parliament regardless of votes of the remaining m - a citizens.  -----Examples----- Input 3 1 5 4 1 2 1 3 Output 1 3 3  Input 3 1 5 3 1 3 1 Output 2 3 2  Input 3 2 5 3 1 3 1 Output 1 2 2
