 You are given a list of numbers. You need to calculate the number of ways the numbers can be arranged. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a number $0 \le n \le 10^5$, the number of entries Anton has in his snow log. Then follow $n$ lines, each containing the two numbers $0 \le a \le b \le 10^{18}$, denoting an interval in which snow fell. -----Output----- Output consists of a single integer – the number of ways in which Anton can place the sensors. This number may be large, so output the remainder modulo $1000000009$. If there is no way Anton can place the sensors, you should instead output the string “shovel time!”, since Anton then must take his snowmobile and manually construct three points with the sought property. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 1 2 3 2 3 Sample Output: 2
