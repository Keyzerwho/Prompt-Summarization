 You are given two indexes. Find the time taken for the index to reach the other index. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers, $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100000$) the number of cabins, and $m$ ($1 \leq m \leq 100000$) the number of trails. Then follows $m$ lines, each describing a trail. The $i$â€™th such line contains three integers, $u_ i$, $v_ i$ and $d_ i$ ($0 \leq u_ i, v_ i < n$, $0 \leq d_ i \leq 12$) meaning that there is a trail between cabin $u_ i$ and cabin $v_ i$ which will take exactly $d$ hours to traverse. (There can be more than one trail between two cabins, and some trails could lead back to the same cabin from where it started). Mr. Day and Dr. Knight start in cabin $0$ and their destination is cabin $n-1$. Each day they start walking at 08:00 in the morning, and then walks non-stop for (at most) $12$ hours before settling down for the night. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the number of hours Dr. Knight needs to wait at the destination before Mr. Day shows up. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 6 0 1 2 0 3 8 1 2 11 2 3 5 2 4 2 4 3 9 Sample Output: 4
