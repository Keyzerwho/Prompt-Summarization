 You are given $n$ skiers. You need to find the minimum summed waiting time of all skiers. 
-----Input-----  - One line containing three integers:  - $N$ ($1 \le N \le 400$), the number of skiers.  - $T$ ($1 \le T \le 720$), the time to travel from the bottom of the hill to the top in minutes.  - $G$ ($1 \le G \le 400$), the number of available gondola cabs.  - A further $N$ lines in no particular order, each containing one integer $X$ ($0 \le X \le 10^6$) which gives the time when a skier arrives at the foot of the mountain. -----Output-----  - One line containing one integer: the minimum possible sum of all waiting times, where the waiting time for one skier is the time difference between their arrival and departure on the next available gondola (which may be shared with any number of other skiers). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 10 2 0 15 30 45 Sample Output 1: 10 Sample Input 2: 4 10 3 0 15 30 45 Sample Output 2: 5
