 You are given an array containing N different numbers. You are asked to find the proportion of these numbers that are divisible by some number. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing four real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ ($0\leq a, b, c, d\leq 90$) representing the sizes of four angles in degrees. The number $a$ represents the angle that the bottom right sprinkler rotates from the right wall; similarly, $b$ is the angle that the top right sprinkler rotates from the top wall, $c$ is the angle that the top left sprinkler rotates from the left wall, and $d$ is the angle that the bottom left sprinkler rotates from the bottom wall. All numbers will be given with no more than $3$ digits after the decimal point. -----Output----- Output the proportion of the area of the courtyard that is watered by the sprinklers as a real number. Your answer will be considered correct if it is within $10^{-6}$ of the correct answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 45 45 0 0 Sample Output: 0.75
