 Given three positive prime numbers $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$ (the wavelengths), three nonnegative integers $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$ (the measurements), and three nonnegative integers $y_1$, $y_2$, $y_3$ (the accuracies), find the smallest nonnegative integer $z$ (the smallest possible distance) such that $z$ is within distance $y_ i$ from $x_ i$ modulo $m_ i$ for each $i = 1,2,3$. An integer $x $ is within distance$y$ from $x$ modulo $m$ if there is some integer $t$ such that $x \equiv x  + t \pmod{m}$ and $|t| \leq y$. 
-----Input----- There are three lines of input. The first line is $m_1$ $m_2$ $m_3$, the second is $x_1$ $x_2$ $x_3$ and the third is $y_1$ $y_2$ $y_3$. You may assume that $0 < m_ i \leq 10^6$, $0 \leq x_ i < m_ i$, and $0 \leq y_ i \leq 300$ for each $i$. The numbers $m_1$, $m_2$, $m_3$ are all primes and distinct. -----Output----- Print one line with the answer $z$. Note that the answer might not fit in a 32-bit integer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 11 13 17 5 2 4 0 0 0 Sample Output: 2095
