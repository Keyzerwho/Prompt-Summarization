 You are given the configuration of the circle before Stanko performed the transformation described above $K$ times. Write a program that determines the number of distinct starting circles that give the same circle after $K$ transformations as Stanko s original circle does after $K$ transformations. Two configurations of pebbles are considered to be the same circle if one can be gotten from the other by rotating it any number of positions. For example BBW and BWB is the same circle whereas BBWWBW and WWBBWB are not.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, $3 \le N \le 100$, $1 \le K \le 10$, where $N$ is the number of pebbles in the circle and $K$ is the number of transformations made by Stanko. The second line contains exactly $N$ characters ‘B’ or ‘W’ representing Stanko’s original circle. -----Output----- Output the number of possible distinct starting circles on a single line. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 BBW Sample Output: 2
