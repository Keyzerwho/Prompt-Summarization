 Given an arbitrary digraph $G$, topologically sort its nodes.
-----Input----- The input specifies a single directed graph. The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 500$,  $0 \leq m \leq n(n-1)$), where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is the number of edges. This is followed by $m$ lines, each containing two space-separated integers, $x$ and $y$ ($0 \leq x,y \leq (n-1)$, $x \neq y$), indicating that there is a directed edge from node $x$ to node $y$, where nodes are indexed $0, 1, 2, \ldots , (n-1)$. No edge will be listed more than once. -----Output----- Output a line containing a single integer: the largest possible size of $S$ at the beginning of any iteration of Step $1$ in the execution of Kahn’s Algorithm. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 0 1 1 2 2 3 Sample Output: 1
