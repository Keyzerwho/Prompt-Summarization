 You are given a sequence of 'user logged on'/'user logged off' messages. You need to determine who can be the leader. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) — the number of team participants and the number of messages. Each of the next m lines contains a message in the format:  '+ id': the record means that the person with number id (1 ≤ id ≤ n) has logged on to the meeting.  '- id': the record means that the person with number id (1 ≤ id ≤ n) has logged off from the meeting.  Assume that all the people of the team are numbered from 1 to n and the messages are given in the chronological order. It is guaranteed that the given sequence is the correct record of a continuous part of the meeting. It is guaranteed that no two log on/log off events occurred simultaneously. -----Output----- In the first line print integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ n) — how many people can be leaders. In the next line, print k integers in the increasing order — the numbers of the people who can be leaders. If the data is such that no member of the team can be a leader, print a single number 0. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 + 1 + 2 - 2 - 1 Output 4 1 3 4 5  Input 3 2 + 1 - 2 Output 1 3  Input 2 4 + 1 - 1 + 2 - 2 Output 0 Input 5 6 + 1 - 1 - 3 + 3 + 4 - 4 Output 3 2 3 5  Input 2 4 + 1 - 2 + 2 - 1 Output 0
