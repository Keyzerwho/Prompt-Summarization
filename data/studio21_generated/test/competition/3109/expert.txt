 You are given $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, where $a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n$. You are also given $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$, where $b_1 < b_2 < \ldots < b_m$. Your task is to find the minimum height of the divider such that $a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + \ldots + b_m = n$. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input begins with a single line with 4 space-separated integers, $n\ m\ w\ h$, where:  - $n$ ($2 \le n \le 200$) is the number of sections  - $m$ ($1 \le m \le 200$) is the number of colors of sand  - $w,h$ ($1 \le w,h \le 5000$) are the width and height of the box (it always has a depth of 1) The next line will contain $m$ space-separated real numbers (with at most 3 decimal places) $v$ ($0<v\le w\cdot h$), which represent the volumes of each color of sand. It is not necessary to use all of the sand, but the minimums for each section must be satisfied. The next line will have $n-1$ space-separated real numbers with at most 3 decimal places) $x$ ($0< x < w$) which represent the distance from the left wall of each divider. The $x$s are guaranteed to be sorted in increasing order. The next $n$ lines will each have $m$ space-separated real numbers (with at most 3 decimal places) $min$ ($0 \le min \le w\cdot h$). The $j$th element of the $i$th row is the minimum amount of sand color $j$ to be put in section $i$. The next $n$ lines will each have $m$ space-separated real numbers (with at most 3 decimal places) $max$ ($0 \le max \le w\cdot h$). The $j$th element of the $i$th row is the maximum amount of sand color $j$ to be put in section $i$, and $min_{ij} \le max_{ij}$. -----Output----- Output a real number rounded to exactly 3 decimal places representing the minimum difference possible between the maximum and minimum heights of sand in the sections. A distribution of sand will always be possible that satisfies the constraints in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 2 5 5 2.0 2.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 Sample Output 1: 0.750 Sample Input 2: 2 2 5 5 2.0 2.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.5 0.0 0.0 2.0 Sample Output 2: 0.625
