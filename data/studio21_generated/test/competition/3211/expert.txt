 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input----- The input starts with a line containing an integer $n$ $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5000$), the number of citizens in Elecuador. Then follows a line containing a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of the characters $0$, $1$, and $2$. This string represents the citizens in the order they arrive to the voting station. If the $i$’th character $s_ i$ is $1$ or $2$, it means that the $i$’th citizen will vote for party $1$ or $2$, respectively. If $s_ i$ is $0$, it means that the $i$’th citizen is a teller. -----Output----- If it is possible to ensure victory, output one integer, the minimum number of swaps necessary. Otherwise, output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 8 12210020 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 4 1111 Sample Output 2: impossible
