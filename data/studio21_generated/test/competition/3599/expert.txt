 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $T$ and $N$ ($1 \le T \le 5000$, $1 \le N \le 500$), the length of the concert in minutes and the number of musicians in the group. The next line contains $N$ integers (each between $1$ and $T$ inclusive) separated by single spaces, the length of the break in minutes for each member. Note: The input data will be such that a solution, although not necessarily unique, will always exist. -----Output----- For each musician output one integer, the number of minutes the musician will spend on stage before going on the break. Output the musicians in the same order they were given in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 8 3 4 4 4 Sample Output: 0 2 4
