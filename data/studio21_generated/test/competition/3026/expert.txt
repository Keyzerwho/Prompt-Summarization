 You are given an array $S$. You are required to find all the critical elements in $S$. 
-----Input----- The input starts with a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$), the length of the given sequence. The next line has $n$ integers giving the numbers in the sequence. The given sequence is a permutation in which each integer from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once. -----Output----- Output all critical elements in the sequence in ascending order. If none of the elements are critical, output “-1”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 1 3 2 4 Sample Output 1: 1 4 Sample Input 2: 5 1 2 3 4 5 Sample Output 2: 1 2 3 4 5 Sample Input 3: 4 2 1 4 3 Sample Output 3: -1
