 You are given two positive integers k and x. You are given n ancient values c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n}. You are to tell Arya $x \operatorname{mod} c_{i}$ if Arya wants. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n,  k ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of ancient integers and value k that is chosen by Pari. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 1 000 000). -----Output----- Print "Yes" (without quotes) if Arya has a winning strategy independent of value of x, or "No" (without quotes) otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 4 5 2 3 5 12 Output Yes Input 2 7 2 3 Output No -----Note----- In the first sample, Arya can understand $x \operatorname{mod} 5$ because 5 is one of the ancient numbers. In the second sample, Arya can't be sure what $x \text{mod} 7$ is. For example 1 and 7 have the same remainders after dividing by 2 and 3, but they differ in remainders after dividing by 7.
