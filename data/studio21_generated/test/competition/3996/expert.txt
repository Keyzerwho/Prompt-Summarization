 You are given an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} such that  $n = \prod_{i = 1}^{k} a_{i}$  in other words, n is multiplication of all elements of the given array. Because of precision difficulties, Barney asked you to tell him the answer as an irreducible fraction. In other words you need to find it as a fraction p / q such that $\operatorname{gcd}(p, q) = 1$, where $gcd$ is the greatest common divisor. Since p and q can be extremely large, you only need to find the remainders of dividing each of them by 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements in array Barney gave you. The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^18) — the elements of the array. -----Output----- In the only line of output print a single string x / y where x is the remainder of dividing p by 10^9 + 7 and y is the remainder of dividing q by 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 Output 1/2 Input 3 1 1 1 Output 0/1
