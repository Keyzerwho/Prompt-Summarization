 You are given a list of participants and a number. You need to find the maximum number of participants that can join. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 1000$), where $n$ denotes the total number of participants and $k$ denotes the number of places on the bus. The second line contains $n$ integers $x_{i}$ for $i=1,2,\ldots ,n$, where $1 \leq x_ i \leq n$. The meaning of $x_ i$ is that the $i$-th participant will refuse to join the excursion unless the $x_ i$-th participant also joins. -----Output----- Output one integer: the maximum number of participants that can join the excursion, so that all the participantsâ€™ preferences are obeyed and the capacity of the bus is not exceeded. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 4 1 2 3 4 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 12 3 2 3 4 5 6 7 4 7 8 8 12 12 Sample Output 2: 2
