 You are given a frog dance to be performed by some number of frogs.  The dance consists of a sequence of jumps. A jump is either to the left or to the right. The frog king wants you to find the minimum total number of jumps the frogs need to make in order to end in the climax, i.e. all frogs form one big tower. 
-----Input-----  - A single line containing two integers $0 \leq n \leq 5000$ and $0\leq t\leq 10^6$, the initial number of frogs and the initial position of the frog tower.  - The second line contains $n$ integers $0\leq p_ i\leq 10^6$, the starting positions of these frogs.  - Then follows a line with an integer $0\leq C\leq 10^6$, the number of changes the king makes.  - $C$ lines follow, each of one of the following three forms.  - A line of the form $+$ $a$ indicates that the king adds a frog at position $a$.  - A line of the form $-$ $a$ indicates that the king removes a frog from position $a$. You may assume that at least one frog started from this position before removing it.  - A line of the form $\mathrm t$ $a$ indicates that the king changes the position of the frog tower to $a$. In each case $a$ is between $0$ and $10^6$ inclusive. It is guaranteed that the number of times the kings adds or removes a frog is at most$5000$. -----Output----- For each of the $C$ modifications, print one line containing the lowest total number of jumps of the dance after applying the modification. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 1 0 7 t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 Sample Output 1: 0 1 3 2 3 5 3 Sample Input 2: 3 0 2 6 6 10 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 t 6 t 7 t 8 t 9 t 10 Sample Output 2: 11 6 5 9 4 3 7 9 9 10
