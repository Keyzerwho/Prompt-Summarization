 You are given an array of integers. You need to compute the longest path Harry can take to reach his bed. 
-----Input-----  - On the first line are four space-separated integers: the number of plastic balls $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, the number of tubes $0 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, and the locations of Harry and his bed $0 \leq s, t < n$.  - Then $m$ lines follow, each containing three space-separated integers describing a single tube: the ball in which the tube starts $0 \leq a_ i < n$, in which it ends $0 \leq b_ i < n$ and the time it takes to traverse $1 \leq w_ i \leq 10^4$. Note that each tube can only be traversed in one direction. -----Output----- Print the time it takes for Harry to reach his bed, or the string infinity if Harry is doomed to roam the tubes forever. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 5 0 3 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 0 4 2 3 1 2 3 3 Sample Output 1: 11 Sample Input 2: 5 5 0 4 0 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 0 1 2 4 1 Sample Output 2: infinity Sample Input 3: 2 1 0 1 0 1 2 Sample Output 3: 2 Sample Input 4: 3 3 1 2 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 1 Sample Output 4: infinity
