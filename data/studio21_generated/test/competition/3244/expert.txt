 you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer $N$ $(3 \le N \le 10000)$, the number of integers in the ring. Each of the following lines contains an integer less than $10^9$ (one billion). These numbers, in order, form the second ring. The input will be such that a solution, although not necesarily unique, will always exist. -----Output----- Output the original ring on $N$ lines. The numbers must be non-negative. Rotating the ring is not allowed. For example, the sum of the first three output numbers must be equal to the second number in the input ring. Note: the solution need not be unique. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 5 5 5 Sample Output 1: 2 1 2 Sample Input 2: 4 20 15 17 14 Sample Output 2: 5 8 2 7
