 You are given a snapshot of the sensors readings. You need to design a plan to move the car to the rightmost lane. The plan must minimize the safety factor. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 100$), $M$ ($M \geq 1$), $R$ ($1 \leq R \leq 1000000$) indicating the number of lanes, the number of cars on the road, and the sensor range. The next $M$ lines describe each car with three integers: the lane number (between 0 and $N-1$, inclusive), the length of the car (positive), and the distance from the start of the sensor range to the back of the car. The distance is non-negative and at most $R$. The first car given is the ACM car. Lane 0 is the leftmost lane, and lane $N-1$ is the rightmost lane. There are at most 100 cars in each lane. No two cars will overlap although they may touch bumper-to-bumper. -----Output----- If the ACM car can switch from lane 0 to lane $N-1$, print a single number indicating the maximum achievable safety factor. Otherwise, print Impossible. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $10^{-5}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 5 100 0 10 10 1 10 5 1 20 35 2 2 18 2 40 50 Sample Output: 2.500000
