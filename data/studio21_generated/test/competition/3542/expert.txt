 You are at an empty circuit board of size $N \times M$. The two points $A_1$ and $A_2$ are connected to each other using one wire. The two points $B_1$ and $B_2$ are connected to each other using another wire. The wires must go along the horizontal and vertical edges of the grid. The wires may not share a common vertex. Determine the minimum length of wire needed to do so. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, $N$ ($2 \le N \le 100$) and $M$ ($2 \le M \le 100$), the grid size of the circuit board. Then follows four lines containing the coordinates for the points $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$ and $B_2$, respectively. Each coordinate pair will be described using two integers and will correspond to an intersection point in the grid. The first coordinate will be between $0$ and $N$ inclusive and the second coordinate between $0$ and $M$ inclusive. All coordinate pairs will be unique. -----Output----- A single line containing the minimum length of wire needed to connect the points, or “IMPOSSIBLE” if it’s not possible to do so. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 3 2 3 4 0 0 2 6 1 Sample Output: IMPOSSIBLE
