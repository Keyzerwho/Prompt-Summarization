 Given $N$, the number of groups, $X$, the number of seats per row, and $N$, the number of seats. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 12$), giving the size of the largest group in the test case. Then follows a line with $n$ non-negative integers, the $i$-th integer ($1$-indexed) denoting the number of groups of $i$ persons who need to be seated. Each such number is at most $30$, and not all of them are $0$. -----Output----- A single number; the size of the smallest widest row that will accommodate all the guests. If this number is greater than $12$, output impossible instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 0 1 1 Sample Output: 3
