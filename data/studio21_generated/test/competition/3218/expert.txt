 You are given a hexagonal grid with $n$ rows, where $n$ is an odd integer. The rows are numbered $1$ to $n$ from top to bottom. The odd-numbered rows have exactly $n$ hexagons, and the even-numbered rows have exactly $n-1$ hexagons. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($n$ is an odd integer between $1$ and $7$). The next $n$ lines contain the numbers $a_{i, j}$ $(-1 \le a_{i, j} \le 6)$. The $i$-th line contains exactly $n$ integers if $i$ is odd, and $n-1$ integers otherwise. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of valid colorings. -----Explanation of the sample input----- The first sample was shown in the above figures. The second example is shown below: -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 -1 2 -1 2 2 1 -1 1 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 7 -1 4 5 1 0 -1 -1 -1 3 2 0 0 1 -1 4 -1 1 0 -1 -1 1 3 4 2 2 4 0 2 3 -1 4 4 2 -1 4 4 3 3 2 1 -1 -1 -1 4 2 -1 Sample Output 2: 1
