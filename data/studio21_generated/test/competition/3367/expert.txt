 You are given a topic, and the host reads one question from it. The topic is picked uniformly at random from the pool of possible topics. The questions are picked uniformly at random from the pool of possible questions. Each question may be asked multiple times. The questions are read at a pace of one word per second. Teresa can interrupt the host mid-question between words, or even before hearing the first word but not mid-word that would be extremely impolite. Answering also takes one second, and the host will start reading another question immediately after an answer unless Teresa interrupts again. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $t$ and $n$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$, $1 \leq n \leq 100\ 000$), the duration of the quiz and the number of questions. Each of the following $n$ lines contains a question, which is a space-separated list of words terminated by a question mark; and an answer, which is a single word. Each word is a sequence of non-space ASCII printable characters, between the ASCII values of ‘!’ and ‘$\sim $’. Only the last word of a question has a question mark (‘?’). You can assume that no question is a prefix of another and that punctuation marks are part of a word. Words spelled with different upper/lower case are assumed to be different. It is guaranteed that the total number of word characters is at most $100\ 000$. -----Output----- Output the expected score of an optimal strategy. Answers within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 4 How much is 6 times 9? 42 How much is 9 times 6? 42 Is there intelligent life on Earth? Probably What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow? African? Sample Output: 2.0000000000
