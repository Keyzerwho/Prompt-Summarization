 You are given two non-negative integers $A$ and $B$. You need to find if it is possible to play a multi-composition on the multi-piano (i.e. to play a multi-piano) such that Mirka plays as many correct pitches as possible. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 10^6$), the number of multi-keys in the multi- composition on the multi-radio. The second line of input contains $N$ integers $a_ i$ ($-10^9 \leq a_ i \leq 10^9$), the multi-keys played in the multi-composition. -----Output----- The first line of output must contain the maximum number of multi-keys that Mirka can play correctly. The second line of output must contain the non-negative number $K$ that Mirka must choose in order to hit as many correct pitches as possible. The number must be smaller than or equal to $2 \cdot 10^9$. The required number does not have to be unique, but will surely exist within the given constraints. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1 2 0 3 1 Sample Output: 3 2
