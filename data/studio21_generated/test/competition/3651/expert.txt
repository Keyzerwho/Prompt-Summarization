 You are given the position of each Rebel planet. You are allowed to revisit planets. You have to find the shortest distance possible. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $n$ $(2 \leq n \leq 18)$, the number of Rebel planets. This is followed by $n$ lines, each giving the position of one Rebel planet in 3D space, the first of which is Catherineâ€™s home planet (where she begins her mission). Every planet position is a unique triplet of space-separated integers $x$ $y$ $z$ $(0 \leq x, y, z \leq 500)$. -----Output----- Output a single line containing the minimum total distance Catherine needs to travel in order to visit every Rebel planet and return to her home planet. Your answer will be accepted if it is within $10^{-6}$ of the official answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0 3 2 1 3 Sample Output: 2.0
