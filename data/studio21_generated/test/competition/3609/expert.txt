 Given a list of edges, determine if they are from a tree.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$). The next $2(n-1)$ lines each contain two integers $u, v$ ($1 \le u < v \le n$) indicating an edge joining the two nodes $u$ and $v$. A pair $(u, v)$ may be connected by more than one edge. -----Output----- If it is possible for the edges to be the union of two trees that grow left-to-right and right-to-left, output a string of length $2(n-1)$, where the $i$’s character is L if the $i$’th edge should come from the left tree, or R if it should come from the right tree. Otherwise, output the word “impossible” on a single line. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them. -----Explanation of Sample Inputs----- In the first example, there are two solutions: LLRRRRLL and LLRLRRLR. In the second example, there are no solutions. Note that LRLR is not valid, because it would involve the right tree growing backward, from left to right. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1 2 2 5 2 3 1 3 3 5 4 5 3 4 1 3 Sample Output: LLRRRRLL
