 You are given the location of all  Exploding Kittens  and  Defuse  cards in the deck. Assume everyone starts with an empty hand and plays optimally. Show the winner and number of rounds. 
-----Input----- The first line consists of three integers $N$, the number of players in the game, $E$, the number of “Exploding Kitten” cards, and $D$, the number of “Defuse” cards. Note that $2\leq N\leq 1000$ and $2\leq D, E\leq 10000$. The next line of the input contains $E$ integers $e_ i$ ($0\leq e_ i\leq 2\cdot 10^9$). This represents the number of cards between a “Exploding Kitten” card and the top card of the deck. The final line of the input contains $D$ integers $d_ i$ ($0\leq d_ i\leq 2\cdot 10^9$). This represents the number of cards between a “Defuse” card and the top of the deck. It is guaranteed that all “Exploding Kittens” and “Defuse” cards given in the input are located at distinct locations within the deck. -----Output----- If there is a winner, print the ID of the winner, defined as the number of players who took their turn before the winner on the first round. Otherwise, print $-1$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 4 3 3 4 5 7 1 2 10 Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 3 5 2 1 4 7 9 11 2 3 Sample Output 2: 2
