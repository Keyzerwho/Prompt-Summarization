 You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $p$ where $1 \le n \le 1000$ is the number of buildings, $0 \le m \le 100000$ is the number of possible direct connections between a pair of buildings, and $0 \le p \le n$ is the number of insecure buildings. The buildings are numbered from $1$ to $n$. The second line contains $p$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$ (inclusive), which are the numbers of insecure buildings. Each of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$, and $\ell _ i$ describing one potential direct line, where $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ $(1 \le x_ i, y_ i \le n)$ are the distinct buildings the line connects, and $\ell _ i$ $(1 \le \ell _ i \le 10000)$ is the estimate of the cost of connecting these buildings. There is at most one direct link between any two buildings in these $m$ lines. -----Output----- Display the cost of the cheapest network satisfying the security measure if it is possible. Otherwise, display impossible. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 6 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 4 1 2 3 2 2 4 4 3 4 3 Sample Output: 6
