 You are given an array of integers. The array is sorted in ascending order. You need to return the array sorted in descending order. 
-----Input----- Input consists of a single program. Each line contains a single valid statement. Each pair of adjacent tokens in the input is separated by a single space. Integers in the input will all be in the range $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$. Input ends at end of file. -----Output----- Give the output (PRINT and PRINTLN statements) of the input program when it is executed. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10 LET A = 1 20 PRINT "HELLO THERE " 30 PRINTLN A 40 LET A = A + 1 50 IF A <= 5 THEN GOTO 20 60 PRINTLN "DONE" Sample Output: HELLO THERE 1 HELLO THERE 2 HELLO THERE 3 HELLO THERE 4 HELLO THERE 5 DONE
