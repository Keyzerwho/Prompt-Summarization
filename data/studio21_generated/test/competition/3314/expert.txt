 You are given three wheels. Each wheel has n columns. You need to rotate the wheels so that every column has three distinct letters across the three wheels. 
-----Input----- The input has exactly three lines. Each line has a string $s$ ($2 \leq |s| \leq 5 \cdot 10^3$) consisting only of upper-case letters ‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’, describing the letters of one wheel in their initial positions. All three strings will be of the same length. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of rotations required, or $-1$ if it isn’t possible. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: ABC ABC ABC Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: ABBBAAAA BBBCCCBB CCCCAAAC Sample Output 2: 3
