 You are given a monster Master Yang and Master Yang wants to know the minimum number of bitcoins he can spend in order to win. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers HP_{Y}, ATK_{Y}, DEF_{Y}, separated by a space, denoting the initial HP, ATK and DEF of Master Yang. The second line contains three integers HP_{M}, ATK_{M}, DEF_{M}, separated by a space, denoting the HP, ATK and DEF of the monster. The third line contains three integers h, a, d, separated by a space, denoting the price of 1 HP, 1 ATK and 1 DEF. All numbers in input are integer and lie between 1 and 100 inclusively. -----Output----- The only output line should contain an integer, denoting the minimum bitcoins Master Yang should spend in order to win. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 1 1 100 1 1 100 100 Output 99 Input 100 100 100 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 0 -----Note----- For the first sample, prices for ATK and DEF are extremely high. Master Yang can buy 99 HP, then he can beat the monster with 1 HP left. For the second sample, Master Yang is strong enough to beat the monster, so he doesn't need to buy anything.
