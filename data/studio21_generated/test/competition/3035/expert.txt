 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The input consists of the following:  - One line containing a single integer $0\leq N \leq 10^5$, the number of children in the class room, excluding yourself;  - $N$ lines, each containing two strings $O, W$ and a floating point number $0.5 < R < 2$, the name of the lemonade that is offered, the name of the lemonade that is wanted, and the exchange rate: for every litre of lemonade $W$ that you trade you get $R$ litres of lemonade $O$ in return. Exchange rates are given with at most $7$ digits after the decimal point. All strings are guaranteed to have at most $10$ alphanumeric characters. -----Output----- Output a single line containing a single floating point number $M$, the maximum amount (in litres) of blue lemonade that you can obtain. In case you could obtain more than $10$ litres, $M$ is considered to be $10$. You are required to output $M$ with absolute precision $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 blue pink 1.0 red pink 1.5 blue red 1.0 Sample Output 1: 1.500000000000000 Sample Input 2: 2 blue red 1.0 red pink 1.5 Sample Output 2: 0.000000000000000 Sample Input 3: 4 orange pink 1.9 yellow orange 1.9 green yellow 1.9 blue green 1.9 Sample Output 3: 10.000000000000000
