 You must decide whether the statements given are consistent with each other. That is, the two words foo and moo do not rhyme with each other, unless the word oo or o exists in the input. 
-----Input----- The first line consists of an integer $0 \le N \le 100000$, the number of statements. The next $N$ lines consists of statements of the two given forms. -----Output----- Output should consist of the string "yes", if the statements are consistent with each other, i.e. everything which is stated to be the same either explicitly or by Mårten’s Theorem, really is the same. If you can find contradiction, output the string "wait what?". -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 herp is derp derp is herp herp is herp derp is derp Sample Output 1: yes Sample Input 2: 3 oskar not lukas oskar is poptart lukas is smart Sample Output 2: wait what? Sample Input 3: 1 moo not foo Sample Output 3: yes
