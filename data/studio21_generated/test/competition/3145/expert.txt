 You are given two integers $A$ and $B$. Find how many multiples of $X$ are between $A$ and $B$ (inclusive), such that, when written in decimal, they contain only certain allowed digits. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers $X$, $A$ and $B$ ($1 \le X < 10^{11}$ , $1 \le A \le B < 10^{11}$). The second line contains the allowed digits. The digits will be given with no spaces, sorted in increasing order and without duplicates. There will be at least one allowed digit. -----Output----- Output the number of multiples Zvonko can make on a single line. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 20 0123456789 Sample Output 1: 10 Sample Input 2: 6 100 9294 23689 Sample Output 2: 111
