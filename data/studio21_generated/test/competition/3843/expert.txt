 Little robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Help her calculate this number. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers, given in the decimal notation, n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9) — the number of hours in one day and the number of minutes in one hour, respectively. -----Output----- Print one integer in decimal notation — the number of different pairs of hour and minute, such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 Output 4 Input 8 2 Output 5 -----Note----- In the first sample, possible pairs are: (0: 1), (0: 2), (1: 0), (1: 2). In the second sample, possible pairs are: (02: 1), (03: 1), (04: 1), (05: 1), (06: 1).
