 You are given all the two-person teams. You need to output the smallest number of people that must be invited in order to get at least one person from each project, as well as a list of people to invite. If possible (subject to the set of people being smallest possible), the list of invitees should include your friend. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $1 \le m \le 10000$, the number of teams. The following $m$ lines each contain two integers, $i,j$ separated by a space, being the employee IDs of the two employees in that team (the first one is from Stockholm and the second one is from London). Stockholm employees have IDs in the range $1000$ to $1999$ and London employees have IDs in the range $2000$ to $2999$. An employee can be a member of several teams, but there cannot be several teams consisting of the same pair of employees. Your friend has ID $1009$. -----Output----- Output first a single line with an integer $k$ indicating the smallest number of employees that must be invited to meet the requirements above. Then output $k$ lines giving the IDs of employees to invite. If possible (subject to $k$ being smallest possible), the list should contain your friend. If there are several solutions subject to these constraints, anyone is acceptable. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1009 2011 1017 2011 Sample Output: 1 2011
