 You are given a list of positive integers. Write an AI to play this new Jeopardy category. If there are several different possible solutions for $n$ and $k$, the AI should choose the most elegant solution, having the smallest value of $n$, and of those with the smallest $n$ it should choose the one with the smallest value of $k$. 
-----Input----- Input consists of a single integer $X$ ($1 \le X \le 10^{100}$). -----Output----- Output two non-negative integers $n$ and $k$ such that the binomial coefficient $n$ choose $k$ equals $X$, with ties between multiple solutions broken as explained above. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 Sample Output 1: 5 2 Sample Input 2: 2020 Sample Output 2: 2020 1
