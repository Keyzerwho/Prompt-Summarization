 You are given a list of numbers $[n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k]$. Find the maximum damage, where $n_i$ is the weight of $i$-th pillar. 
-----Input----- Input consists of two lines. On the first row, the number $n$ of pillars, with $1\leq n\leq 100000$. On the second row, $n$ integers $b_0$, $\ldots $, $b_{n-1}$, where $1000 \leq b_ i\leq 100000000$, representing how much each internal pillar can support (in kN), from left to right. -----Output----- A single line with two integers. First the maximal damage (counted in number of destroyed pillars) that Finn can cause. Second, the pillar he has to tear down. The internal pillars are numbered $0$, $1$, $\ldots $, $n-1$. If there are more than one correct answers, any will do. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1341 2412 1200 3112 2391 Sample Output: 3 1
