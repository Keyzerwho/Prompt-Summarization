 You are given a race track. You are given a ratio $r$. You are given a velocity $v$. You are given a position $x$. You need to find the number of gems you can collect 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line will contain four integers: $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) is the number of gems, $r$ ($1 \le r \le 10$) is the ratio of vertical velocity to maximum horizontal speed, $w$ ($1 \le w \le 10^9$) is the width of the track, and $h$ ($1 \le h \le 10^9$) is the height of the finish line. Following this will be $n$ lines, each containing an integer $x$ and $y$ coordinate ($0 \le x \le w$, $1 \le y \le h$), containing the coordinate of a gem. All gems will lie on the race track. None will be on the start line. -----Output----- Output a single integer on a line by itself representing the maximum number of gems that you can collect. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 1 10 10 8 8 5 1 4 6 4 7 7 9 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 5 1 100 100 27 75 79 77 40 93 62 41 52 45 Sample Output 2: 3
