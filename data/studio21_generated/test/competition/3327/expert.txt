 You are given an empty crossword puzzle and a scrambled list of all of the solutions to the clues. Each clue consists of two words, separated by a space. Your task is to position the solutions appropriately on the grid. Words must start/end either on the edge of the grid or beside a void space. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of two space-separated integers, $R$ and $C$ ($1 \leq R, C \leq 21$), specifying the number of rows and columns in the crossword grid. $R$ line follow, each of which consists of $C$ characters, specifying the grid for the unsolved crossword. Within this grid, a “#" character represents a void space (i.e. a space where no letters may be placed) and a “." character represents an empty space, where a letter should be placed. The next line consists of a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 200$). $N$ lines follow, each of which consists of a single string of at least length $2$, consisting of only uppercase letters from “A" to “Z". These lines, given in no particular order, specify every word of the crossword solution that must be placed either horizontally or vertically on the grid. -----Output----- Print an $R$ by $C$ grid consisting of the solved crossword.  You may assume that there will be exactly one solution in every test case. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 15 ##.........#### 1 CROSSWORD Sample Output: ##CROSSWORD####
