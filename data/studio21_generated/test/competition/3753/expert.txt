 =====Problem Statement===== You are Evil Witch, and your task is to find out the minimum number of cells you have to turn into impassable forests so that Vasya is no longer able to reach the treasure. 
-----Input----- First line of input contains two positive integers $n$, $m$ ($3 \le n \cdot m \le 1\,000\,000$), sizes of the island. Following $n$ lines contains strings $s_i$ of length $m$ describing the island, $j$-th character of string $s_i$ equals "#" if cell $(i, j)$ contains an impassable forest and "." if the cell is free and passable. Let us remind you that Vasya gets of his ship at the cell $(1, 1)$, i.e. the first cell of the first row, and he wants to reach cell $(n, m)$, i.e. the last cell of the last row. It's guaranteed, that cells $(1, 1)$ and $(n, m)$ are empty. -----Output----- Print the only integer $k$, which is the minimum number of cells Evil Witch has to turn into impassable forest in order to prevent Vasya from reaching the treasure. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 .. .. Output 2 Input 4 4 .... #.#. .... .#.. Output 1 Input 3 4 .... .##. .... Output 2 -----Note----- The following picture illustrates the island in the third example. Blue arrows show possible paths Vasya may use to go from $(1, 1)$ to $(n, m)$. Red illustrates one possible set of cells for the Witch to turn into impassable forest to make Vasya's trip from $(1, 1)$ to $(n, m)$ impossible. [Image]
