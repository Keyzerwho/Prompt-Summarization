 You are given n days of vacations. On each day, you can do the following: have a rest, write the contest, or do sport. Find the minimum number of days on which you will have rest. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of days of Vasya's vacations. The second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 3) separated by space, where:    a_{i} equals 0, if on the i-th day of vacations the gym is closed and the contest is not carried out;  a_{i} equals 1, if on the i-th day of vacations the gym is closed, but the contest is carried out;  a_{i} equals 2, if on the i-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is not carried out;  a_{i} equals 3, if on the i-th day of vacations the gym is open and the contest is carried out. -----Output----- Print the minimum possible number of days on which Vasya will have a rest. Remember that Vasya refuses:   to do sport on any two consecutive days,  to write the contest on any two consecutive days.  -----Examples----- Input 4 1 3 2 0 Output 2 Input 7 1 3 3 2 1 2 3 Output 0 Input 2 2 2 Output 1 -----Note----- In the first test Vasya can write the contest on the day number 1 and do sport on the day number 3. Thus, he will have a rest for only 2 days. In the second test Vasya should write contests on days number 1, 3, 5 and 7, in other days do sport. Thus, he will not have a rest for a single day. In the third test Vasya can do sport either on a day number 1 or number 2. He can not do sport in two days, because it will be contrary to the his limitation. Thus, he will have a rest for only one day.
