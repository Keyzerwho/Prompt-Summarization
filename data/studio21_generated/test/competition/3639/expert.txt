 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 
-----Input-----  - One line containing a single positive integer $T$ ($0 < T \le 10000$), the number of minutes from now you want to be home by at the latest.  - Another line with two positive floating point numbers: $c$ ($0.01 \le c \le 10$), the constant determining your sweating, and $d$ ($1 \le d \le 50$), the distance from university to home in kilometres.  - $T$ more lines, where each line contains an integer $r_ i$ ($0 \le r_ i \le 100$) the number of millilitres of rain during the $i$-th minute interval (zero-based). -----Output----- On a single line print a floating point number: the number of millilitres of rain and sweat you get wet from when optimally planning your cycle home. Your answer should be correct up to an absolute or relative precision of $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 0.1 2.0 0 0 0 0 0 Sample Output: 288
