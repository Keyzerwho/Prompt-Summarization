 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the expected weight of each picture after all the $m$ visits modulo $998244353$. It can be proved that such $r_i$ exists and is unique. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$, $1\le m\le 3000$) — the number of pictures and the number of visits to the website. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$) — if $a_i=0$ , Nauuo does not like the $i$-th picture; otherwise Nauuo likes the $i$-th picture. It is guaranteed that there is at least one picture which Nauuo likes. The third line contains $n$ positive integers $w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$ ($w_i \geq 1$) — the initial weights of the pictures. It is guaranteed that the sum of all the initial weights does not exceed $998244352-m$. -----Output----- The output contains $n$ integers $r_1,r_2,\ldots,r_n$ — the expected weights modulo $998244353$. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 0 1 2 1 Output 332748119 332748119 Input 1 2 1 1 Output 3 Input 3 3 0 1 1 4 3 5 Output 160955686 185138929 974061117 -----Note----- In the first example, if the only visit shows the first picture with a probability of $\frac 2 3$, the final weights are $(1,1)$; if the only visit shows the second picture with a probability of $\frac1 3$, the final weights are $(2,2)$. So, both expected weights are $\frac2 3\cdot 1+\frac 1 3\cdot 2=\frac4 3$ . Because $332748119\cdot 3\equiv 4\pmod{998244353}$, you need to print $332748119$ instead of $\frac4 3$ or $1.3333333333$. In the second example, there is only one picture which Nauuo likes, so every time Nauuo visits the website, $w_1$ will be increased by $1$. So, the expected weight is $1+2=3$. Nauuo is very naughty so she didn't give you any hint of the third example.
