 You are given an integer $n$. Find the number of different representations (in binary) of $n$. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of the input contains a string consisting of ’0’ and ’1’. The string represents a non-negative integer $N$ in binary. The leftmost bit is the most significant one. The number of bits will be at least $1$ and at most $10000$. -----Output----- Output a line giving the number of different binary representations of $N$ that also use $2$ as a digit. Since this number might be big, output the remainder modulo $1000000009$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1001 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 1111 Sample Output 2: 1
