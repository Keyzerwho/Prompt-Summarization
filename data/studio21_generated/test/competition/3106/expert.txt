 You are given $n$ lights, each with its own button, in a line. Pressing a light s button will toggle that light s state; if the light is on, it will turn off, and if the light is off, it will turn on. The lights change at $1$ second timesteps. You can press a button at any time, but it will not take effect until the next timestep. Before each timestep, you may choose to push at most one button (you may also choose to not press any button). Pushing a button will affect not just the light in question, but all lights down the line. More specifically, if you choose to press the $i^\textrm {th}$ button right before the $k^\textrm {th}$ timestep, then the $(i+m)^\textrm {th}$ light will toggle on the $(k+m)^\textrm {th}$ timestep (with $i+m \le n$). For example, if you press button $5$ just before time $19$, then light $5$ will toggle at time $19$, light $6$ will toggle at time $20$,
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will consist of a single string $S$ ($1 \le |S| \le 16$). The string $S$ will contain only the characters $1$ and $0$, where $1$ represents that that light is initially on, and $0$ represents that that light is initially off. The first character is light $1$, the next is light $2$, and so on. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the earliest time at which all of the lights are on. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1101 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 1 Sample Output 2: 0
