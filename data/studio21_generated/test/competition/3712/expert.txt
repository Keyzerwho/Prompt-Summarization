 You are given n, the number of compartments on the train. The number of compartments on the train is n, and each student has bought a ticket in one compartment.   Return the minimum number of students that need to swap places with other students so that no compartment on the train had bored students.  
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the number of compartments in the carriage. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} showing how many students ride in each compartment (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 4). It is guaranteed that at least one student is riding in the train. -----Output----- If no sequence of swapping seats with other people leads to the desired result, print number "-1" (without the quotes). In another case, print the smallest number of people you need to persuade to swap places. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 2 4 3 Output 2 Input 3 4 1 1 Output 2 Input 4 0 3 0 4 Output 0
