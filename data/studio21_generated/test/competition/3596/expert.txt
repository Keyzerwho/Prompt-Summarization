 You are given the location of your opponent. You need to find how Arnar described the opponent s location. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input starts with three real numbers $a, b, c$, $-10^9 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^9$ and $1 \leq c \leq 10^9$. These numbers will have at most 6 digits after the decimal point. The second line has four integers $t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$, $1 \leq t_ i \leq 10^9$. The third line has five integers $n, k, r, s, l$, $1 \leq n, k, r, s, l \leq 10^3$. -----Output----- The output should consist of one line containing the location of Arnarâ€™s opponent as described above. -----Examples----- Sample Input: -99.99 99.99 9999.99 99 9 999 9999 9 99 9 99 9 Sample Output: 9.585073
