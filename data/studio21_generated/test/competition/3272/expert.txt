 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A, you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 500$), which are the dimensions of the tomb. Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string $s$ ($|s|=m$) with the characters described above. This is the floorplan of the tomb. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of gargoyles that have to be rotated in order to unlock the treasure door. If the puzzle has no solution, output $-1$. -----Sample Explanation----- The above are illustrations of Sample Input/Output $1$ with the initial configuration on the left and the solution of the puzzle on the right. Three gargoyles are rotated to solve the puzzle. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 5 /.V.\ ./.V. ..#.. .V.#. \.V./ Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 2 5 V...\ H...V Sample Output 2: -1
