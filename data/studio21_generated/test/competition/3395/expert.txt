 Your goal is to claim at least one cell containing the resource  iron ore  and at least one cell with resource  coal  in order to be able to build soldiers. What is the minimal number of settlers you need to reach this goal  
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with three integers $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$), the number of cells on the playing field, $m$ ($1 \le m < n$), the number of cells containing iron ore, and $k$ ($1 \le k < n$), the number of cells containing coal.  - One line with $m$ distinct integers $o_1, \ldots , o_ m$ ($1 \le o_ i \le n$ for all $1\le i\le m$), where $o_1, \ldots , o_ m$ are the IDs of cells with iron ore.  - One line with $k$ distinct integers $c_1, \ldots , c_ k$ ($1 \le c_ i \le n$ for all $1\le i\le k$), where $c_1, \ldots , c_ k$ are the IDs of cells with coal.  - $n$ lines describing the topology of the board. The $j$-th line of this block specifies the accessible neighbours of the $j$-th cell and consists of the following integers:  - One integer $0\le a \le 10$, the number of cells accessible from cell $j$.  - $a$ distinct integers $b_1,\dots , b_ a$ ($1 \le b_ i \le n$, $b_ i \ne j$ for all $1\le i\le a$), the IDs of the cells accessible from cell $j$. It is guaranteed, that no cell contains both resources, iron ore and coal. At the beginning of the game you own only the cell with ID $1$. -----Output----- Output the minimum number of settlers needed to claim at least one cell with coal and at least one cell with iron ore. Output “impossible” if it is impossible to own both, coal and iron ore. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 1 1 1 Sample Output: 2
