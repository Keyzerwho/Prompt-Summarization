 You are given $N$ witches, $N$ brooms, $N$ initial rotations and $N$ heights. You need to check if witches can dance without crashing into each other. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 200000$), the number of witches. The next $N$ lines contains a description of each broom. Each line consists of the real numbers $x_ i, y_ i$ ($-10^{9} \le x_ i \le y_ i 10^{9}$), and the real number $r_ i$ ($0 \le r_ i < 2\pi $), all with at most $20$ digits after the decimal point. The coordinates are measured in meters, and give you the end of the broom that the broom rotates around. The input will be such that the answer does not change even if the length of the brooms were $1 + 10^{-6}\text { m}$ long. -----Output----- Output ok if no witches will crash into each other, and crash if at least one pair of witches will crash. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 0 0 0 0 1.5 0 Sample Output: ok
