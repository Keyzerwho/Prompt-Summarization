 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $4 \leq n \leq 400$, the number of participants, and $c$, the number of known first encounters. The next $c$ lines are each in the format $a$ $b$ $y$, meaning participants $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a < b \leq n$) met for the first time in year $y$ ($1948 \leq y < 2008$). No pair of participants will appear more than once on the list, and every pair of participants not in the list is assumed to have met only now (in the year $2008$). -----Output----- Output either the smallest year $Y$ such that it is possible to divide the participants in two parts, neither of which contains more than $2n/3$ people, such that all people in the first part first met before year $Y$, and all people in the second part first met in or after year $Y$. If there is no such year, output the string ’Impossible’. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 6 1 2 1987 2 3 1987 1 3 1987 2 4 1987 1 4 1987 3 4 1987 Sample Output: Impossible
