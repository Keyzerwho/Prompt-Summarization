 Given $n$ towns, how many round trips are possible? 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100000$, $0 \leq m \leq 200000$), where $n$ is the number of towns (indexed $0, 1, \ldots , n-1$) and $m$ is the number of one-way roads. This is followed by $m$ lines, each containing two space-separated integers, $x$ and $y$ ($0 \leq x,y \leq (n-1)$, $x \neq y$), indicating that there is a one-way road from town $x$ to town $y$. No road will be specified more than once. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the maximum number of one-way roads that can be constructed without creating any new round trips. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 0 1 Sample Output: 0
