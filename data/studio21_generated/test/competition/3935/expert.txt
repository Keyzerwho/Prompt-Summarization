 You are given set $B$ consisting of positive integers. You need to erase a subset of minimum size from $B$ so that graph constructed on the new set is bipartite. Recall, that graph is bipartite if all its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from different sets. 
-----Input----- First line contains an integer $n ~ (1 \leqslant n \leqslant 200\,000)$ — size of $B$ Second line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n ~ (1 \leqslant b_i \leqslant 10^{18})$ — numbers of $B$, all $b_i$ are unique -----Output----- In the first line print single integer $k$ – the number of erased elements. In the second line print $k$ integers — values of erased elements. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 Output 1 2  Input 2 2 6 Output 0
