 You are given two cities, A and B. You need to determine if Jon Dayne can assign a collection of cities to each one of his sisters such that each city in a collection is connected with a direct road to all other cities in that collection and the remaining cities, not in these two collections, are also connected with a direct road to each other. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$, where $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2000$) is the number of cities, and $m$ ($0 \leq m \leq m(m-1)/2$) is the number of roads. Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ ($1 \le x_ i, y_ i \le n$) describing one road, where $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ are the distinct cities the road connects. Two cities are connected by at most one road. Winterfell is city $1$ and Kingâ€™s Landing is city $2$ in the road network. -----Output----- If it is not possible to partition the cities in the way explained, display the word impossible. Otherwise, display two lines: the first containing the cities in the collection assigned to Arya and the second containing the collection of cities assigned to Sansa. If there are many such collections, any one of them is acceptable. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 9 11 1 4 5 4 1 5 6 2 6 7 7 2 3 8 3 9 8 9 6 8 5 9 Sample Output: 1 4 5 2 6 7
