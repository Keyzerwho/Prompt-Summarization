 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
Note: for this task, each year has exactly 365 days. -----Input----- The first line contains $N$ and $M$ ($1 \le N, M \le 200$) - the number of telescopes and the number of event types. The next $N$ lines each contains $M + 4$ numbers each: $D_1\text { }M_1\text { }D_2\text { }M_2\text { }F_1\text { }F_2\text { }...\text { }F_ M$ where $D_1, M_1$ ($01 \le D \le 31, 01 \le M \le 12$) is the start date, $D_2, M_2$ is the end date and $F_ i$ ($0 \le F_ i \le 200$) is the number of times event $I$ was observed. Note that the days $D_ i$ and months $M_ i$ will always be zero-padded to exactly 2 characters. -----Output----- One line containing $M$ numbers, the durations of the event types. If more than one solution exists, output any one. If no solution exists, output “-1” (without quotes). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 1 26 02 03 03 1 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 1 1 26 02 03 03 2 Sample Output 2: 185
