 You are given a number of magnitude n + 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the number of rooms. The second line contains n integers p_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ i). Each p_{i} denotes the number of the room, that someone can reach, if he will use the second portal in the i-th room. -----Output----- Print a single number — the number of portal moves the boy needs to go out of the maze. As the number can be rather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 Output 4 Input 4 1 1 2 3 Output 20 Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output 62
