 You are given $p$ and $m$. Calculate the probability, that you will be able to buy tickets for your entire group.
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing four integers:  - $1 \le m \le 1000$: the total number of people who entered the lottery.  - $1 \le n \le m$: the total number of winners drawn.  - $1 \le t \le 100$: the number of tickets each winner is allowed to buy.  - $1 \le p \le m$: the number of people in your group. -----Output----- Output a single line containing the probability that your entire group can get tickets to the show. This probability should be given with an absolute error of at most $10^{-9}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 100 10 2 1 Sample Output 1: 0.1 Sample Input 2: 100 10 2 2 Sample Output 2: 0.1909090909
