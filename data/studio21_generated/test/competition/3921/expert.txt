 Given n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, find the length of the longest good sequence. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of good integers. The second line contains a single-space separated list of good integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} in strictly increasing order (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^5; a_{i} < a_{i} + 1). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the length of the longest good sequence. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 4 6 9 Output 4 Input 9 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first example, the following sequences are examples of good sequences: [2; 4; 6; 9], [2; 4; 6], [3; 9], [6]. The length of the longest good sequence is 4.
