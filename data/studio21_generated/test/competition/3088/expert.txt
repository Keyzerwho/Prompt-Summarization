 You are given an integer $n$. You need to find the number of swaps you can make so that $n$ will be larger than $k$. 
-----Input----- The input has a single line with two integers $n$ ($100 \leq n < 10^{18}$) and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 18$). -----Output----- Output the largest number you can get after exactly $k$ swaps. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1374 2 Sample Output 1: 7413 Sample Input 2: 210 1 Sample Output 2: 201
