 You are given 2 integer arrays of length N, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_N$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_N$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N c_1 a_1 c_2 a_2 : c_{2N} a_{2N} -----Output----- Print the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective. -----Sample Input----- 3 B 1 W 2 B 3 W 1 W 3 B 2 -----Sample Output----- 4 The objective can be achieved in four operations, for example, as follows:  - Swap the black 3 and white 1.  - Swap the white 1 and white 2.  - Swap the black 3 and white 3.  - Swap the black 3 and black 2.
