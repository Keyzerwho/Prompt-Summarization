 You are given two stacks. You need to copy them, remove numbers from one of them, and count required numbers. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 300000$), the number of steps in Mirkoâ€™s game. The steps of the game are chronologically denoted with the first $N$ integers. The $i$-th of the following $N$ lines contains the description of the $i$-th step of the game in one of the following three forms:  - a v for an operation of type 1.  - b v for an operation of type 2.  - c v w for an operation of type 3. The first character in the line denotes the type of operation and the following one or two denote the accompanying stack labels that will always be integers from the interval $[0, i - 1]$. For each operation of type 2, the stack we are removing the element from will not be empty. -----Output----- For each operation type 2 or 3 output the required number, each in their own line, in the order the operations were given in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 a 0 a 1 b 2 c 2 3 b 4 Sample Output: 2 1 2
