 You are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days. 
-----Input----- In the only line of input data there is a non-empty string s consisting of characters 0 and 1, which describes the history of Oleg's life. Its length (denoted as |s|) does not exceed 200 000 characters. -----Output----- If there is a way to divide history into zebra subsequences, in the first line of output you should print an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ |s|), the resulting number of subsequences. In the i-th of following k lines first print the integer l_{i} (1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ |s|), which is the length of the i-th subsequence, and then l_{i} indices of days forming the subsequence. Indices must follow in ascending order. Days are numbered starting from 1. Each index from 1 to n must belong to exactly one subsequence. If there is no way to divide day history into zebra subsequences, print -1. Subsequences may be printed in any order. If there are several solutions, you may print any of them. You do not have to minimize nor maximize the value of k. -----Examples----- Input 0010100 Output 3 3 1 3 4 3 2 5 6 1 7 Input 111 Output -1
