 You are given N, the number of junctions, and $N - 1$, the number of bidirectional roads. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains one integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 3 \cdot 10^{5})$ — the number of junctions.  - Each of the rest $N - 1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ $(1 \leq u, v \leq N, u \neq v)$ — two endpoints of a single road. -----Output-----  - The only line contains exactly one integer — the number of optimal paths of length $2$. -----Explanation for the first example-----  - There are two optimal paths of length $2$: $(2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3)$ and $(3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2)$.  - The path $(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1)$ is a valid path of length $2$ from $1$ to $1$ but it is not optimal since there is a path of length $0$ from $1$ to $1$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 2 1 3 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 5 2 1 1 5 3 1 4 3 Sample Output 2: 8 Sample Input 3: 10 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 5 3 6 2 7 7 8 5 9 5 10 Sample Output 3: 24
