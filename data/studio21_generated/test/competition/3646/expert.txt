 You are given a sequence of numbers of dark spots on the pebbles in the line. You are asked to find the most distant pebble which can be reached by a sequence of jumps. The first jump starts at the first pebble in the line and a jump between two pebbles is possible if and only if the sum of numbers of spots on both pebbles is equal to the distance between them. You may suppose that the line of pebbles is straight and that the distance between each two neighboring pebbles is exactly one frog distance unit. 
-----Input----- Each case starts with a line containing one integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000000$) representing the number of pebbles. The second line contains a list of $N$ integers. The order of the integers in the list is the same as the order of the pebbles in the wetland, each integer represents the number of spots on the corresponding pebble. No pebble contains more than $10^9$ spots. Suppose that Addawser knows all different pairs of pebbles where Yoshi can perform a jump from one pebble to another one during his sequence of jumps. You are guaranteed that the number of those pairs of pebbles never exceeds $1000000$. -----Output----- Print a single line with one integer denoting the distance of the pebble which can be reached by successive jumps according to the given rules and which is the most distant from the first pebble. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 7 2 1 0 1 2 3 3 Sample Output: 5
