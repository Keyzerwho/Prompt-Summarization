 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain n nodes. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24). Next line contains n positive integers: the i-th number represents c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- Output on the first line "YES" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output "NO" (without quotes).  -----Examples----- Input 4 1 1 1 4 Output YES Input 5 1 1 5 2 1 Output NO
