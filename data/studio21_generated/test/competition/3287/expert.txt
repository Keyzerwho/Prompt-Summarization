 You are given an array containing integers, and an integer $k$.  Return the minimum possible value of the loot they must leave behind, in order to be able to split the remaining loot evenly. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $1 \le k \le 10^6$ â€“ the number of denominations in Logland. The next line contains the $k$ integers $0 \le x_0, x_1, \dots , x_{k-1} \le 2^{30}$, the number of coins of the denominations $2^0, 2^1, \dots , 2^{k - 1}$. -----Output----- Output a single line, the minimum amount of money the thieves must leave behind. Since this number may be very large, output it modulo the prime number $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 0 2 0 1 Sample Output 1: 8 Sample Input 2: 5 1000000 1 1 1 1 Sample Output 2: 0
