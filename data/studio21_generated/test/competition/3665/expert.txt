 You have a list of numbers. You need to change some of the numbers in that list such that the resulting list becomes sorted. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line containing the integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 40$, $1 \le m \le 400$), the number of numbers and the number of digits in each number, respectively.  - $n$ lines each containing an integer $v$ ($0 \le v < 10^{m}$). The numbers are zero-padded to exactly $m$ digits. -----Output----- Write a sorted version of the array, after making a minimum number of digit changes to make the numbers sorted (the numbers must remain zero-padded to $m$ digits). If there are multiple optimal solutions, you may give any of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 111 001 000 111 000 Sample Output: 001 001 001 111 200
