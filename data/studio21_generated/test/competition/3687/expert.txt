 You are given a list of integers $a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z$. 
-----Input-----  - one line containing three positive integers $n,q,s$ ($1\leq n,q \leq 30$, $1 \leq s \leq 100$), the number of downlink windows, FIFO queues, and sensors, respectively.  - one line with $s$ integers $q_1 \ldots q_ s$ ($1 \leq q_ i \leq q$ for each $i$), determining for each sensor the queue it feeds its data into.  - one line with $q$ integers $c_1 \ldots c_ q$ ($1 \leq c_ i \leq 10^6$ for each $i$), determining for each queue the size of the queue in megabytes.  - $n$ lines, each describing one downlink window. Each contains $s + 1$ non-negative integers.  - The first integer $d$ ($1 \leq d \leq 10^6$) states the number of megabytes that can be transferred to earth during the window.  - The following $s$ numbers $a_1 \ldots a_ s$ ($0 \leq a_ i \leq 10^6$ for each $i$) describing the amount of data (in megabytes) generated by each of the sensors after the last but before this downlink window. There will never be new data during a downlink window. -----Output----- Output “possible” if it is possible to transfer all data to Earth, and “impossible” otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 2 2 1 2 3 3 5 2 2 5 2 2 Sample Output: possible
