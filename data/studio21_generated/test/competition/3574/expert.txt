 You are given an array $a$ of length $N$ consisting of numbers. Your task is to answer for each pair $(L, R)$ of integers:  if $a[L] < a[R]$ then $a$ is magical, otherwise $a$ is not magical. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 500000$), the number of numbers in the array. The second line contains $N$ integers $a_ i$ ($1 \leq a_ i \leq 10^9$). The third line contains the integer $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 500000$), the number of queries. Each of the following $Q$ lines contains two integers, $L$ and $R$ ($1 \leq L \leq R \leq N$), representing the sub-array from the query. -----Output----- The $i$-th line of output must contain a single integerâ€”the answer to the $i$-th query. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 5 4 3 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 2 4 Sample Output: 2 1 3
