 You are given an array with n elements. You are asked to find all permutations of length n that can be formed from the given array. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100). The second line contains n space-separated integers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation that Petya's got as a present. The third line contains Masha's permutation s, in the similar format. It is guaranteed that the given sequences q and s are correct permutations. -----Output----- If the situation that is described in the statement is possible, print "YES" (without the quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 3 4 Output NO Input 4 1 4 3 1 2 3 4 2 1 Output YES Input 4 3 4 3 1 2 3 4 2 1 Output YES Input 4 2 4 3 1 2 2 1 4 3 Output YES Input 4 1 4 3 1 2 2 1 4 3 Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample Masha's permutation coincides with the permutation that was written on the board before the beginning of the game. Consequently, that violates the condition that Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before k moves were performed. In the second sample the described situation is possible, in case if after we toss a coin, we get tails. In the third sample the possible coin tossing sequence is: heads-tails-tails. In the fourth sample the possible coin tossing sequence is: heads-heads.
