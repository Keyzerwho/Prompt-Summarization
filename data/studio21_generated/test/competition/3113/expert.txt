 You are given two coordinate points $(x, y)$ and $(x', y')$ on the $xy$-plane.  You need to output "yes" or "no". 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $n$, $(0 \le n \le 100000)$, the number of triangles Garry wrote down. Each of the next $n$ lines contains $6$ space separated integers, $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, $x_3$, and $y_3$. These are Garry’s triangles. The next line contains the integer $m$, $(0 \le m \le 100000)$, the number of triangles Jerry wrote down. Each of the next $m$ lines contains $6$ space separated integers, $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$, $x_3$, and $y_3$. These are Jerry’s triangles. The absolute value of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are at most $10^9$. (That’s as far as Garry and Jerry can see.) -----Output----- Print “yes” if Garry and Jerry saw the same cloud cover, or “no” if they did not. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 10000 0 10000 10000 0 10000 3 10000 0 10000 10000 5000 5000 5000 5000 10000 10000 0 10000 0 0 0 1000 1000 0 Sample Output 1: no Sample Input 2: 2 9996 0 9997 0 0 1 9999 0 10000 0 0 1 2 9997 0 9998 0 0 1 9998 0 9999 0 0 1 Sample Output 2: no
