 You are given a map of a network. Each node is a switch. Each cable has a length. You need to find switches that can never be part of an optimal path when transmitting a network packet from switch $1$ to switch $n$, no matter what the values of $v$ and $c$ are. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2000$, $1 \leq m \leq 10^4$), the number of switches and the number of cables in the network. The switches are numbered from $1$ to $n$.  - $m$ lines, each with three integers $a$, $b$ and $\ell $ ($1 \leq a, b \leq n$, $1\leq \ell \leq 10^9$), representing a network cable of length $\ell $ connecting switches $a$ and $b$. There is at most one cable connecting a given pair of switches, and no cable connects a switch to itself. It is guaranteed that there exists a path between every pair of switches. -----Output----- First output a line with an integer $k$, the number of switches that could never possibly be part of an optimal path when a packet is transmitted from switch $1$ to switch $n$. Then output a line with $k$ integers, the indices of the $k$ unused switches, in increasing order. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 8 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 4 3 2 6 1 2 7 2 3 5 1 4 7 2 5 7 1 Sample Output 1: 2 4 6 Sample Input 2: 5 6 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 5 2 1 4 3 4 5 3 1 5 6 Sample Output 2: 0
