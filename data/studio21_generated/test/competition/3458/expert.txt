 You are given a list of numbers. You need to find a subset of these numbers such that its xor-sum is as large as possible. The subset should be unique. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $n$ $(1\le n\le 100000)$: the length of the list of numbers in Gunnar’s file. The second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_1, \dots , a_ n$ $(1\leq a_ i \le 10^{18})$, the numbers in the file. -----Output----- Output one line with the answer – the maximal number Gunnar can get by selecting a subset of the list of numbers and calculating the xor-sum of the subset. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 3 5 Sample Output: 7
