 You are given $n$ and a sequence $a = (a_1, \dots , a_ n)$. Determine whether there are two permutations $\pi $ and $\sigma $ such that $\pi _ i + \sigma _ i = a_ i \pmod{n}$ for each $i$. If there are more such pairs, print any of them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the length $n$ of the sequence and the permutation is written. The second line contains integers $a_1, \dots , a_ n$, satisfying $1 \leq a_ i \leq n$. The length $n$ satisfies $1 \leq n \leq 1000$. -----Output----- If there is no solution, output “impossible”. If there is a solution, output any of them, writing the two permutations on one line each. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 2 3 1 1 Sample Output: 1 4 3 5 2  2 3 5 1 4
