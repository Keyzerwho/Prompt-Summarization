 You are given two integers $X$ and $Y$. You should construct an array such that, removing all non-empty subsequences in which Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -  Minimum_element_of_subsequence    d from the set of all subsequences will give you $X$ subsequences. 
Example: if the fee is 4, SWERC provides a cost of 20, using banks 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6, in this order. However, using bank 2 as an intermediary, we can pay only 19. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 8 1 6 1 2 5 1 3 1 2 6 6 2 3 6 4 2 3 3 4 1 4 5 1 5 6 1 5 1 3 6 5 4 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 3 4 1 2 1 2 6 1 3 2 1 2 7 2 3 3 2 1 2 Sample Output 2: Infinity
