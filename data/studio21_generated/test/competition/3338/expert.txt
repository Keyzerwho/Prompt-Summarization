 You are given a set of $n$ partners. Seine wants to choose at most $k$ partners to awaken to maximize $d(S)$. What is the maximum $d(S)$ she can achieve  
-----Input----- The first line of the input has two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2000$). The next $n$ lines each have four integers $g, p, g_ a, p_ a$ to describe one partner’s skill levels. The first two integers $g, p$ are the partner’s Frag and Step values before being awakened ($1 \leq g, p \leq 10^9$). The last two integers $g_ a, p_ a$ are zeroes if the partner cannot be awakened. Otherwise $g_ a, p_ a$ give the partner’s new Frag and Step values after being awakened, and it is guaranteed that $g < g_ a \leq 10^9$ and $p < p_ a \leq 10^9$. -----Output----- Output the maximum $d(S)$ Seine can achieve, if she can awaken up to $k$ partners. Note that Seine may choose to not awaken any partner. -----Note----- Arcaea is created and developed by Lowiro Limited.
