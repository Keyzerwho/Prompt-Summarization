 You are given a string. Find the number of occurrences of each character in the string. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a non-negative integer $3 \leq N \leq 200$, denoting both the dimension of the field and the maximum possible length of GL-bot’s program. The next line contains a non-empty string of length at most $N$, consisting only of the characters <, >, ^, and v. This string denotes GL-bot’s program. Thereafter follows $N$ lines, each consists of a string consisting of $N$ characters. Each line describes a row of the grid — the $j$-th character of the $i$-th line denotes the content of the cell located at the $i$-th row from the top and $j$-th column from the left, and is either one of these:  - #: denotes an impassable cell.  - .: denotes an empty cell.  - R: denotes an empty cell on which the robot initially resides. It is guaranteed that the grid will contain exactly one character R, and that the first and final rows and columns consist entirely of the character #. -----Output----- If the robot’s trail is of finite length, print a single integer $1$. Otherwise, print a single integer $X$ as described in the problem statement.Sample Data Explanation In the first example, the trail of the robot is illustrated as follows: Hence, $X=2$ in this case. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 >^<^ ###### #.#..# #....# #..R.# #....# ###### Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 4 v<^> #### #.R# #..# #### Sample Output 2: 4 Sample Input 3: 4 <<< #### #.R# #..# #### Sample Output 3: 1
