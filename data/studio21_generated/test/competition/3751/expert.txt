 You are given a list of identifiers of some program with removed spaces and line breaks. Check if this program can be a result of Kostya's obfuscation. 
-----Input----- In the only line of input there is a string S of lowercase English letters (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 500) — the identifiers of a program with removed whitespace characters. -----Output----- If this program can be a result of Kostya's obfuscation, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO". -----Examples----- Input abacaba Output YES Input jinotega Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample case, one possible list of identifiers would be "number string number character number string number". Here how Kostya would obfuscate the program:  replace all occurences of number with a, the result would be "a string a character a string a",  replace all occurences of string with b, the result would be "a b a character a b a",  replace all occurences of character with c, the result would be "a b a c a b a",  all identifiers have been replaced, thus the obfuscation is finished.
