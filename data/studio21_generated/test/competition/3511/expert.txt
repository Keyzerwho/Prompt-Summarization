 You are given two unordered lists of Size N and N+1 find and return the additional element in the second list. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains exactly $2$ positive integers $N$ and $Q$. $(1 \le N, Q \le 10^5)$. $Q$ lines follow, each line contains exactly one query. As explained, a query can be one of the following $2$ types:  - $1 \; u \; v$: Linux puts a stone inside one of the boxes between $u$ and $v$.  - $2$: Linux asks Bash to compute $E(A)$. -----Output----- It can be proved that the expected value can be represented as an irreducible fraction $\dfrac {A}{B}$. For each query of type $2$, print one line containing the value $A \times B^{-1}$ modulo $10^{9} + 7$. The given input guarantees that $B$ is not a multiple of $10^{9} + 7$. -----Explanation for examples-----  - In the first example: With a probability of $0.5$, two stones are in different squares. Hence, the answer to the fourth query is $0.5 \times (1^{2} + 1^{2}) + 0.5 \times 2^{2} = 3$.  - In the second example: With a probability of $\frac{2}{3}$, two stones are in different squares. Hence, the answer to the fourth query is $\frac{2}{3} \times 2 + \frac{1}{3} \times 4 = \frac{8}{3}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 4 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 Sample Output: 1 3
