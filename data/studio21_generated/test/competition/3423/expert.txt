 You are given a list of packages to be installed. No package should be installed before all the packages it depends on are installed. You may assume that, at the beginning, no packages have been installed. 
-----Input----- Input consists of up to $10$ test cases. Each test case start with a number $1 \le n \le 1000$, which is the number of packages the user wants to install. This is followed by $n$ lines which describe $n$ packages. Each package description starts with the name of the package and is followed by a space-separated list of the package’s unique dependencies. Each package has at most $20$ dependencies, and each is one of the other $n-1$ packages. Each package name is a string of up to $40$ non-whitespace characters using the English alphabet (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), as well as the characters _, -, ., and + (i.e. underscore, minus, period, and plus). Input ends when $n$ is zero. -----Output----- For each test case, output the order of package installation that allow them all to be installed after their respective dependencies. If there are multiple possible orderings, then give the ordering that is lexicographically first (using ASCII values for string ordering). If there is some group of packages that are not able to be ordered within the list, output ‘cannot be ordered’ instead of ordering the packages. Put a blank line between each pair of test cases. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 14 libattr vim-X11 vim-common gtk2 libattr vim-common gtk2 libtiff atk pango glib2 libtiff zlib libjpeg atk pango xorg-x11-libs freetype glib2 glib2 zlib libjpeg xorg-x11-libs grep freetype grep pcre pcre freetype 3 emacs xorg-x11 lisp xorg-x11 lisp emacs 0 Sample Output: atk freetype glib2 libattr libjpeg pcre grep vim-common xorg-x11-libs pango zlib libtiff gtk2 vim-X11 cannot be ordered
