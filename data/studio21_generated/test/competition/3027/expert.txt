 # Task  Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform. # 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will begin with a line with two integers, $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 500$) indicating the height and width of the mark on the paper. Each of the next $n$ lines will have exactly $m$ characters, consisting only of ‘#’ and ‘.’, representing the mark. Every test case will have at least one ‘#’. -----Output----- Output a single line with a single integer, indicating the minimum number of nubs of a bureaucrat’s stamp that could have possibly made the input mark by stamping exactly twice. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 8 ..#..#.. .######. .######. ..#..#.. Sample Output 1: 8 Sample Input 2: 3 3 ... .#. ... Sample Output 2: 1 Sample Input 3: 2 6 .##### #####. Sample Output 3: 5
