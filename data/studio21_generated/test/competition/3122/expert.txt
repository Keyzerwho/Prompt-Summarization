 You are given two arrays, one containing integers, and the other containing strings. You need to return the number of pairs of integers that are equal. For example, if you have arrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], then return 2. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two non-negative integers $1 \leq n,m \leq 200\; 000$, giving the number of airports and routes in the Amanda Catalog respectively. Thereafter follow $m$ lines, each describing a route by three non-negative integers $1 \leq a, b \leq n$ and $c \in \{ 0,1,2\} $, where $a$ and $b$ are the airports the route connects and $c$ is the number of lounges. No route connects any airport with itself, and for any two airports at most one requirement for that route is given. As one would expect, $0$ is a request for no lounge, $1$ for a lounge at exactly one of the two airports and $2$ for lounges at both airports. -----Output----- If it is possible to satisfy the requirements, give the minimum number of lounges necessary to do so. If it is not possible, output impossible. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 4 1 2 2 2 3 1 3 4 1 4 1 2 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 5 5 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 1 4 5 1 Sample Output 2: impossible
