 You are given N integers $x_i, y_i$ (1 <= i <= N - 1). You need to find the number of ways (in modulo 10^9 + 7) to divide the vertices into a pair such that every edge has at least one ribbon going through it. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2 : x_{N - 1} y_{N - 1} -----Output----- Print the number of the ways to divide the vertices into pairs, satisfying the condition, modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Sample Input----- 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 -----Sample Output----- 2 There are three possible ways to divide the vertices into pairs, as shown below, and two satisfy the condition: the middle one and the right one.
