 # Task  Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform. # 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n,k$ ($1\leq k < n \leq 100\ 000$). Then follow $n$ lines, each containing two integers $x_ i,y_ i$, meaning that show $i$ starts at time $x_ i$ and finishes by time $y_ i$. This means that two shows $i$ and $j$, where $y_ i = x_ j$, can be recorded, without conflict, in the same recording slot. You may assume that $0 \leq x_{i} < y_{i} \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$. -----Output----- The output should contain exactly one line with a single integer: the maximum number of full shows from the TV guide that can be recorded with the tape recorder. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 1 2 2 3 2 3 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 4 1 1 3 4 6 7 8 2 5 Sample Output 2: 3
