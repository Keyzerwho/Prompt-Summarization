 You are given a list of $n$ characters each having some feature ($k$ features). You need to create a new character for Tira so that the maximum similarity between Tira s character and any other character is as low as possible. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$, where $1 \le n \le 10^5$ is the number of players (excluding Tira) and $1 \le k \le 20$ is the number of features. Then follow $n$ lines describing the existing characters. Each of these $n$ lines contains a string of $k$ digits which are either $0$ or $1$. A $1$ in position $j$ means the character has the $j$’th feature, and a $0$ means that it does not have the $j$’th feature. -----Output----- Output a single line describing the features of Tira’s character in the same format as in the input. If there are multiple possible characters with the same smallest maximum similarity, any one of them will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 5 01001 11100 10111 Sample Output: 00010
