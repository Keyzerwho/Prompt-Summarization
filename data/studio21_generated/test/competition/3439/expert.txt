 You are given a $2$-dimensional map where each square has average altitude. The sea level has altitude of $0$. Water can flow to any of its $8$ neighbours, even if the two squares only share a corner. Water respects gravity, so it can only flow closer to the Earth s core.
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $h$ and $w$, $1 \leq h, w \leq 500$, denoting the height and width of the map. Then follow $h$ lines, each containing $w$ integers. The first line represents the northernmost row of Gunnar’s map. Each integer represents the altitude of a square on the map grid. The altitude is given in meters and it is at least $-10^6$ and at most $10^6$. The last line contains two integers $i$ and $j$, $1 \leq i \leq h, 1 \leq j \leq w$, indicating that the draining device is placed in the cell corresponding to the $j$’th column of the $i$’th row. You may assume that position $(i, j)$ has negative altitude (i.e., the draining device is not placed on land). -----Output----- Output one line with one integer – the total volume of sea water drained, in cubic meters. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 -5 2 -5 -1 -2 -1 5 4 -5 2 2 Sample Output: 10
