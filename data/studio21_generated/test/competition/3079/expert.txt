 You have two strings $A$ and $B$. A player takes a letter $a$ from $A$ and appends it to the end of $B$. The player alternates taking letters from $A$ and $B$. The player wins if the resulting word $B$ is alphabetically before $A$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an even positive integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 100 000$). The second line of input contains $N$ characters, the starting letter sequence.

The second line of output must contain the most beautiful word that Slavko can have at the end of the game. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 ne Sample Output 1: NE n Sample Input 2: 4 kava Sample Output 2: DA ak
