 You are given two integers $n$ and $m$. You have to build two polynomials with degrees not greater than n, such that their coefficients are integers not exceeding 1 by their absolute value, the leading coefficients (ones with the greatest power of x) are equal to one, and the described Euclid's algorithm performs exactly n steps finding their greatest common divisor. Moreover, the degree of the first polynomial should be greater than the degree of the second. By a step of the algorithm we mean the transition from pair $(A, B)$ to pair $(B, A \operatorname{mod} B)$.  
-----Input----- You are given a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 150) — the number of steps of the algorithm you need to reach. -----Output----- Print two polynomials in the following format. In the first line print a single integer m (0 ≤ m ≤ n) — the degree of the polynomial.  In the second line print m + 1 integers between  - 1 and 1 — the coefficients of the polynomial, from constant to leading.  The degree of the first polynomial should be greater than the degree of the second polynomial, the leading coefficients should be equal to 1. Euclid's algorithm should perform exactly n steps when called using these polynomials. If there is no answer for the given n, print -1. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1 0 1 0 1 Input 2 Output 2 -1 0 1 1 0 1 -----Note----- In the second example you can print polynomials x^2 - 1 and x. The sequence of transitions is(x^2 - 1, x) → (x,  - 1) → ( - 1, 0). There are two steps in it.
