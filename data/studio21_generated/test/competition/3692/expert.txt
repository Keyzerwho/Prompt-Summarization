 You are given N integers. Calculate and return the number of regions formed by the circles on the sky. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), denoting the number of circles. The following n lines each contains three space-separated integers x, y and r ( - 10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10, 1 ≤ r ≤ 10), describing a circle whose center is (x, y) and the radius is r. No two circles have the same x, y and r at the same time. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of regions on the plane. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 0 1 2 0 1 4 0 1 Output 4 Input 3 0 0 2 3 0 2 6 0 2 Output 6 Input 3 0 0 2 2 0 2 1 1 2 Output 8 -----Note----- For the first example, $000$  For the second example, [Image]  For the third example, $\text{Q)}$
