 You are given two arrays of integers $a$ and $b$ both containing $n$ elements. In $a$, you may write either $0$ or $1$. In $b$, you may write either $0$ or $1$. Your task is to find the number of possible transactions that must occur in order to balance the accounts. 
-----Input----- Input consists of:  - A line containing two integers $M$, the number of people in the group, with $1\leq M \leq 20$, and $N$, the number of receipts from the trip, with $0\leq N\leq 1000$.  - $N$ lines, each with three integers $a, b, p$, where $0 \leq a,b < M$, and $1 \leq p \leq 1000$, signifying a receipt showing that person $a$ paid $p$ euros for person $b$. -----Output----- Output a single line containing a single integer, the least number of transactions necessary to settle all bills. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 2 0 1 1 2 3 1 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 5 5 0 1 3 1 2 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 4 0 3 Sample Output 2: 0
