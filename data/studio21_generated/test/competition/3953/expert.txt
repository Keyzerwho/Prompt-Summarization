 You are inside an evil temple. You have to purify all cells. The only method of tile purification known to you is by casting the "Purification" spell. You cast this spell on a single tile   then, all cells that are located in the same row and all cells that are located in the same column as the selected tile become purified (including the selected tile)! It is allowed to purify a cell more than once. You would like to purify all n   n cells while minimizing the number of times you cast the "Purification" spell. 
-----Input----- The first line will contain a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Then, n lines follows, each contains n characters. The j-th character in the i-th row represents the cell located at row i and column j. It will be the character 'E' if it is a particularly more evil cell, and '.' otherwise. -----Output----- If there exists no way to purify all the cells, output -1. Otherwise, if your solution casts x "Purification" spells (where x is the minimum possible number of spells), output x lines. Each line should consist of two integers denoting the row and column numbers of the cell on which you should cast the "Purification" spell. -----Examples----- Input 3 .E. E.E .E. Output 1 1 2 2 3 3 Input 3 EEE E.. E.E Output -1 Input 5 EE.EE E.EE. E...E .EE.E EE.EE Output 3 3 1 3 2 2 4 4 5 3 -----Note----- The first example is illustrated as follows. Purple tiles are evil tiles that have not yet been purified. Red tile is the tile on which "Purification" is cast. Yellow tiles are the tiles being purified as a result of the current "Purification" spell. Green tiles are tiles that have been purified previously.
