 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input-----  - The first line of the input consists of two integers $1\leq n \leq 10^5$, the number of huts, and $1\leq q\leq 10^5$, the number of days.  - The second line has $n$ integers $a_0$, $\dots $, $a_{n-1}$ satisfying $1\leq a_ i \leq 10^6$ for $0\leq i < n$, where $a_ i$ is the current number of people in hut $i$.  - Then follow $q$ lines with two integers $0\leq i<n$ and $1\leq x \leq 10^6$. The $j^\textrm {th}$ of these lines indicates that at day $j$ the number of people in hut $i$ changes to $x$. -----Output-----  - Print $q$ lines: the optimal position of the food truck after each of the $q$ nights. If there are multiple optimal positions, print the smallest one. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 4 3 1 3 4 2 0 5 0 9 4 5 2 1 Sample Output: 2 1 2 1
