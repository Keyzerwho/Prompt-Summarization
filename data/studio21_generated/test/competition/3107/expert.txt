 You are given a route of $N$ trucks. Print the number of encounters for each pair. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq M \leq 10^5$), the number of trucks and the number of pairs of trucks we want to know the number of encounters for. The $i$-th of the following $N$ lines contains the description of the route of the $i$-th truck. The first integer in the line, $K_ i$ ($2 \leq K_ i \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$) represents the number of cities on the truck’s route. Afterwards $K_ i$ integers follow, $A_ j$ ($1 \leq A_ j \leq 10^9$), the ordinal numbers of the cities on the truck’s route given in the order which the truck visits them. The sum of routes of all the trucks won’t exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers ($a_ i, b_ i$), the ordinal numbers of the trucks we want to know the number of encounters for. -----Output----- Output $M$ lines. The $i$-th line must contain the number of encounters of the $i$-th pair of trucks from the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 3 1 3 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 3 1 2 2 3 3 1 Sample Output 1: 1 0 2 Sample Input 2: 2 1 4 1 6 3 6 7 3 4 2 6 5 6 1 1 2 Sample Output 2: 3
