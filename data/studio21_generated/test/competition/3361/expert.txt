 You are given a list of integers. You need to partition these integers into two subsets in such a way that the sum of their disparities is minimized.   
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 200$) indicating the number of shipments. The following $n - 1$ lines contain the distances $d(i,j)$. The $i^{th}$ of these lines contains $n - i$ integers and the $j^{th}$ integer of that line gives the value of $d(i, i+j)$. The distances are symmetric, so $d(j, i) = d(i, j)$, and the distance of a shipment to itself is $0$. All distances are integers between $0$ and $10^9$ (inclusive). -----Output----- Display the minimum possible sum of disparities for partitioning the shipments into two groups. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 4 5 0 2 1 3 7 2 0 4 Sample Output: 4
