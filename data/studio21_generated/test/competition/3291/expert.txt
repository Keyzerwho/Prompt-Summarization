 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains two integers $1\leq a,b\leq 10^9$ with $a+b\leq 10^9$ denoting the ratio $a:b$ of your knock-off splitter.  - The second line contains two integers $1\leq c,d\leq 10^9$ with $c+d\leq 10^9$ denoting the ratio $c:d$ of your desired splitter. -----Output-----  - The first line contains an integer $1\leq n\leq 200$, the number of $a:b$ splitters used.  - Then follow $n$ lines, the $i$-th of which contains two integers $-2\leq l_ i,r_ i<n$. Here $l_ i$ is the index of the splitter connected to the left output of the $i$-th splitter, where it deposits $a/(a+b)$ of its input. Similarly $r_ i$ is the index of the splitter receiving $b/(a+b)$ of the input of the $i$-th splitter. The splitters are indexed starting from $0$. The global input is connected to splitter $0$. The special values $-1$ and $-2$ for $l_ i$ and $r_ i$ correspond to the first and second global output, which need to receive $c/(c+d)$ and $d/(c+d)$ of the global input respectively. Note that you cannot place a splitter in such a way that no box ever reaches it, nor in such a way that a box that passes through it will never reach the output. If there are multiple possible solutions, you may output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 3 3 2 Sample Output 1: 1 -2 -1 Sample Input 2: 1 2 3 4 Sample Output 2: 3 -1 1 2 1 0 -2
