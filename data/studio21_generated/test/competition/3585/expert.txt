 You are given $m$ and $k$. You need to find maximum number of bags for which you can always determine the fake bag. This number can get large, so output it modulo the large prime $998244353$. 
-----Input----- The single line of input contains two space-separated integers $m$ and $k$ ($1 \leq m, k \leq 10^6$), where $m$ is the number of weighings available to you and $k$ is the number of coins in each bag. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the maximum number of bags for which you can determine the fake bag in $m$ weighings, modulo the large prime $998244353$. -----Sample Explanation----- One way we can use $2$ weighings to determine the fake bag among $9$ bags, each containing $1$ coin, is as follows:  - On the first weighing, put the coins from bags $1,2,3$ on the left, and the coins from bags $7,8,9$ on the right.  - On the second weighing, put the coins from bags $1,4,7$ on the left, and the coins from bags $3,6,9$ on the right. We can determine the fake bag as follows:  - The first weighing tells us which group of bags $(1,2,3)$, $(4,5,6)$, $(7,8,9)$ contains the fake bag (e.g. if the left side is heavier, then group $(1,2,3)$ contains the fake bag, if both sides are equal, then group $(4,5,6)$ contains the fake bag, otherwise group $(7,8,9)$ contains the fake bag).  - The second weighing will tell us which group of bags $(1,4,7)$, $(2,5,8)$, $(3,6,9)$ contains the fake bag. The resulting fake bag can be uniquely determined as a result. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 Sample Output: 9
