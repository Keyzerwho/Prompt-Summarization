 You are given a list of songs. Find a list of songs with common thread. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of an integer $n$ ($9 \le n \le 100$), the number of songs. Then follow $n$ lines. Each line describes a song, starting with the name of the artist (as a string of ‘a’-‘z’ of at most $15$ characters), followed by an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 40$), the number of songs that can be played directly after this song. Then follows (on the same line) $t$ distinct integers $s_1, \ldots , s_ t$, each between $1$ and $n$, giving the numbers of the songs that can be played after the current song. The songs are numbered from $1$ to $n$, with song number $1$ being described on the first line, and so on. -----Output----- If there is a playlist of nine songs satisfying the requirements, output a list of nine integers giving the numbers of the songs (according to the same numbering as in the input), in the order they should be played. Otherwise, output a single line containing the word “fail”. If there is more than one valid playlist, any one of them will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 a 2 10 3 b 1 6 c 2 1 5 d 1 9 e 1 4 f 1 2 g 2 6 8 h 0 i 1 3 j 1 7 Sample Output 1: 5 4 9 3 1 10 7 6 2 Sample Input 2: 10 a 2 10 3 a 1 6 c 2 1 5 d 1 9 e 1 4 f 1 2 g 2 6 8 h 0 i 1 3 j 1 7 Sample Output 2: fail
