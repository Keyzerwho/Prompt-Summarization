 =====Problem Statement===== You are asked to recreate the behaviour of ancient scrollbars as faithfully as possible. 

-----Input----- The first line consists of $4$ integers $W$, $H$, $F$, $N$, separated by single spaces. The width of the viewport is $W$, with $3\leq W\leq 200$. The height of the viewport is $H$, with $3\leq H\leq 200$. The viewport must show line $F$ of the adjusted input as the first line at the top line; lines are numbered $0,\ldots , L-1$, where $L$ is the total number of lines in the adjusted text; you can assume $0\leq F \leq L - H$ and $H < L$. The following $N$ lines for $1\leq N\leq 30000$ contain the text (not adjusted), between $1$ and $80$ characters per line, including spaces; neither the first nor last character in each line are a space. No word in the language of the Ancients was more than $80$ characters. -----Thumb position----- You have discovered many ancient texts explaining the position $T\in \{ 0,\ldots , H-3\} $ of the thumb. Alas, all are written in arcane languages that are long forgotten. One example reads like this: SUBTRACT H FROM L GIVING DENOMINATOR. SUBTRACT 3 FROM H. MULTIPLY F BY H GIVING NUMERATOR. DIVIDE NUMERATOR BY DENOMINATOR GIVING T REMAINDER Left-Over. Another source claims that $T$ can be determined by an incantation that is almost poetic in its mystery,  H 3 - F *  L H - / and yet another obscure author writes (defun thumb (lines height first) (/ (* (- height 3) first) (- lines height))) -----Output----- Print the window as the Ancients would have seen it, built from minus (-), plus (+), pipe (|), lower-case V (v), caret (^), and upper-case X (X). See the sample output for the details. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 24 5 8 7 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua Ut enim ad minim veniam quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum Sample Output: +------------------------+-+ |exercitation ullamco    |^| |laboris nisi ut aliquip | | |ex ea commodo consequat |X| |Duis aute irure dolor in| | |reprehenderit in        |v| +------------------------+-+
