 You are given two arrays. Find the shortest distance between two indexes. where distance refers to the sum of numbers between indexes from both the sides. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $e$, where $2 \le n \le 100$ describe the number of intersections, $1 \le m \le 5000$ describes the number of roads in the city and $1 \le e \le n$ describes the number of highway exits. Then follow $m$ lines, each consisting of three integers $a,b,l$ such that $1 \le a < b \le n$ and $1 \le l \le 100$ describing a road of length $l$ hundred meters from intersection $a$ to intersection $b$. Then follows a line of $e$ integers, each one a number in $1, \ldots , n$ describing which intersections are connected to highway exits. Finally there is a line with two integers $b$ and $p$ ($1 \le b,p \le n \text { and } b \neq p$) describing the intersections where the brothers and the police cars start, respectively. It will always be possible to travel from any intersection to any other intersection. Roads are only connected at intersection points (although they may cross using bridges or tunnels at others points). Roads can be used in both directions but there cannot be more than one road between two intersections. -----Output----- The minimal speed in km/h required to escape or the word IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible. In the first case any answer with either absolute or relative error smaller than $10^{-6}$ is acceptable. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 1 1 2 7 2 3 8 1 3 2 Sample Output 1: IMPOSSIBLE Sample Input 2: 3 2 1 1 2 7 2 3 8 1 2 3 Sample Output 2: 74.6666666667
