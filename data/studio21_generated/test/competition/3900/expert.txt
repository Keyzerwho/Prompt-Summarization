 You are given an array $A$ of size $n$. Each element of $A$ is an integer. The task is to find the number of different pairs $(i,j)$ such that $i$ and $j$ are distinct and $i \lt j$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integers n and p (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5; 0 ≤ p ≤ n) — the number of coders in the F company and the minimum number of agreed people. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} (1 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ n) — the numbers of coders named by the i-th coder. It is guaranteed that x_{i} ≠ i,  y_{i} ≠ i,  x_{i} ≠ y_{i}. -----Output----- Print a single integer –– the number of possible two-suspect sets. Note that the order of the suspects doesn't matter, that is, sets (1, 2) и (2, 1) are considered identical. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 2 3 1 4 1 4 2 1 Output 6 Input 8 6 5 6 5 7 5 8 6 2 2 1 7 3 1 3 1 4 Output 1
