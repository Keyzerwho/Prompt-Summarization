 You are given a triangle and you are required to find the area of the carpet. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will consist of a single line with three floating point numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($0 < a,b,c \le 100$, at most $10$ digits after the decimal point) representing the distances from the stain to each of the three corners of the carpet. There will be a single space between $a$ and $b$, and between $b$ and $c$. -----Output----- Output a single line with a single floating point number. If there is a carpet that satisfies the constraints, output the area of this carpet. If not, output -1. The output should have an absolute error of at most $10^{-3}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 1 1.732050 Sample Output 1: 1.732050808 Sample Input 2: 1 1 3.0 Sample Output 2: -1
