 You are given a list of employees. Each employee has a name, a salary, and a list of subordinates. Your task is to determine for each employee the immediate boss of that employee, as well as the number of subordinates that employee has. 
-----Input----- On the first line of input are two positive integers $m$ and $q$, where $m$ (at most $100000$) is the number of employees and $q$ (at most $10000$) is the number of queries. The following $m$ lines each list an employee by three integers on the same line: employee ID number (six decimal digits, the first one of which is not zero), yearly salary in Euros and finally height in $\mu $m ($1 \mu \text {m} = 10^{-6}$ meters – accuracy is important at TALL). The chairperson is the employee that earns more than anyone else and is also the tallest person in the company. Then there are $q$ lines listing queries. Each query is a single legal employee ID. The salary is a positive integer which is at most $10000000$. No two employees have the same ID, and no two employees have the same salary. The height of an employee is at least $1000000$ $\mu $m and at most $2500000$ $\mu $m. -----Output----- For each employee ID $x$ in a query output a single line with two integers $y$ and $k$, where $y$ is the ID of $x$’s boss, and $k$ is the number of subordinates of $x$. If the query is the ID of the chairperson, then you should output $0$ as the ID of his or her boss (since the chairperson has no immediate boss except, possibly, God). -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 123456 14323 1700000 123458 41412 1900000 123457 15221 1800000 123456 123458 123457 Sample Output: 123457 0 0 2 123458 1
