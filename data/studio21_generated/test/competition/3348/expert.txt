 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the two space-separated integers $2 \le R, C \le 1000$. The next line contains three non-negative space-separated integers $a, b, c$ â€“ the number of bonbons of the three flavours which Ylva has baked. It is guaranteed that $a + b + c = R \cdot C$. Both $R$ and $C$ will be even. -----Output----- If no good arrangement can be found, output impossible. Otherwise, output $R$ lines, each containing $C$ characters, representing a good arrangement. Each row should contain only characters A, B, C, depending on which flavour should be placed on a certain position. The number of A bonbons placed must be equal to $A$, and so on. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 4 10 3 3 Sample Output: impossible
