 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the length of the longest string that appeared at least twice (appears in two different positions on the paper). 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $L~ (1 \leq L \leq 200000)$, the length of the string Zvonko wrote down. The second line contains a string of $L$ lowercase letter of the English alphabet. -----Output----- Output the length of the longest string that appears twice on a single line. If there is no such string, output zero. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 11 sabcabcfabc Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 18 trutrutiktiktappop Sample Output 2: 4
