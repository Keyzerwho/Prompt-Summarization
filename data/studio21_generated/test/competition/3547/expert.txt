 You are given two arrays $A$ and $B$ of size $n \times n$. For each $i$, $A[i]$ and $B[i]$ represent the area of rectangular plot $i$. The total area of rectangular plot $i$ is $A[i] + B[i]$. Your task is to determine the total actual area of land covered by them. 
-----Input----- There will be a single test case in the input. Each test case will begin with a line with a single integer $n$ ($0 < n \le 5000$), indicating the number of plots of land sold. The next $n$ lines will each have a description of a rectangular plot of land, consisting of four real numbers with at most two decimals after the decimal point:      x1 y1 x2 y2 where $(x_1,y_1)$ is the southwest corner, and $(x_2,y_2)$ is the northeast corner ($-1000 \le x_1 < x_2 \le 1000$, $-1000 \le y_1 < y_2 \le 1000$). -----Output----- Output a single real number, which represents the total actual area covered by all of the rectangular plots of land. Output this number with exactly two decimal places, rounded. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 0 0 100 100 30 30 60 60 Sample Output: 10000.00
