 Given $n$ rooms, find all the sets of rooms that are identical. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of rooms in the maze ($1 \leq n \leq 100$). Rooms are numbered from 1 to $n$. Following this are $n$ lines, describing each room in order. Each line consists of an integer $k$, indicating that this room has $k$ corridors ($0 \leq k < 100$), and then $k$ distinct integers listing the rooms each corridor connects to (in clockwise order, from an arbitrary starting point). Rooms do not connect to themselves. -----Output----- Display one line for each maximal set of effectively identical rooms (ignoring sets of size 1) containing the room numbers in the set in increasing order. Order the sets by their smallest room numbers. If there are no such sets, display none instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 13 2 2 4 3 1 3 5 2 2 4 3 1 3 6 2 2 6 2 4 5 2 8 9 2 7 9 2 7 8 2 11 13 2 10 12 2 11 13 2 10 12 Sample Output: 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
