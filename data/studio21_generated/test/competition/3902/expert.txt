 You are given a word. Find all distinct strings with the length 2 or 3, which can be suffixes of this word according to the word constructing rules in Reberland language
-----Input----- The only line contains a string s (5 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^4) consisting of lowercase English letters. -----Output----- On the first line print integer k — a number of distinct possible suffixes. On the next k lines print suffixes.  Print suffixes in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.  -----Examples----- Input abacabaca Output 3 aca ba ca Input abaca Output 0 -----Note----- The first test was analysed in the problem statement.  In the second example the length of the string equals 5. The length of the root equals 5, so no string can be used as a suffix.
