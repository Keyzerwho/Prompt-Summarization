 You are given $N$ integers in the range $1$ to $N$. For each integer $i$, you are given two integers $d_i$ and $r_i$. The integer $d_i$ describes the difficulty of the task $i$, and $r_i$ describes its "difficulty". For example, $d_i=3$ means that task $i$ has difficulty $3$. The integer $r_i$ can be $1$ or $2$. The task $i$ is considered to be difficult of $r_i$ if $d_i=r_i$. The task $i$ is considered to be difficult of $d_i$ if $d_i<r_i$. The task $i$ is considered to be difficult of $d_i$ if $d_i>r_i$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 100000$). The second line of input contains $N$ integers not greater than $10^9$. The $i$th number in this line is equal to the number of available tasks having difficulty exactly $i$. The third line of input contains $N-1$ integers not greater than $10^9$. The $i$th number in this line is equal to the number of available tasks having difficulty either $i$ or $i+1$. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required number of ways modulo $1000000007$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 0 1 0 1 Sample Output: 3
