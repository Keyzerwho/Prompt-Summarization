 You are given a sequence of integers. You need to find the longest subsegment of the sequence such that it is possible to change at most one number from the subsegment to make the subsegment strictly increasing. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- In a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum length of the required subsegment. -----Examples----- Input 6 7 2 3 1 5 6 Output 5 -----Note----- You can choose subsegment a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 and change its 3rd element (that is a_4) to 4.
