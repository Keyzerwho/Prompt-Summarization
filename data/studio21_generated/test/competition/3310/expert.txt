 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with three integers $n, g, t$ ($1 \le n \le 100, 1\leq g\leq 200, 1\leq t \leq 100$), the number of tables in the restaurant, the maximum group size, and the number of hours the restaurant is open.  - One line with $n$ integers $c_1, \ldots , c_ n$ ($1 \le c_ i \le 200$ for each $i$) giving the capacities of the tables. -----Output----- Output the expected number of people in the restaurant when it closes. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 2 1 2 3 Sample Output 1: 3.666666667 Sample Input 2: 4 11 4 10 10 10 10 Sample Output 2: 20.000000000
