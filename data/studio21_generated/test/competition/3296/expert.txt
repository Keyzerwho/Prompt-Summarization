 You are given a number $P$ and a number $N$. You need to output the number of code permutations from $1$ to $N$ such that $2^{31} \bmod P = 1$. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two integers $N\ (1 \leq N \leq 100)$ and $K\ (1 \leq K \leq 2^{31}-1)$ respectively. -----Output----- The number of permutations of $N$ elements of order $K$, modulo $2^{31}-1$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 6 6 Sample Output 2: 240
