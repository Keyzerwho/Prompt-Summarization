 You are given two numbers R and S, and for each lawsuit, you are asked to make a ruling. The input is the number of lawsuits L (1<=L<=10), two numbers R and S (1<=R,S<=10), and for each lawsuit, two numbers $A_1, B_1, \dots, A_L, B_L$ (1<=A_1,B_1<\dots<A_L,B_L<=10). You need to return the number of lawsuits won by individual or corporation. 


-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers, $R$ ($1 \leq R \leq 2000$), $S$ ($1 \leq S \leq 2000$) and $L$ ($\max (R, S) \leq L \leq 2000$) the number of individuals, the number of corporations and the number of lawsuits. The next $L$ lines contain the descriptions of the lawsuits. In particular, the $i^\text {th}$ of these lines contains two integers $A_ i$ ($1 \leq A_ i \leq R$) and $B_ i$ ($1 \leq B_ i \leq S$), denoting that the $i^\text {th}$ lawsuit involves individual $A_ i$ and corporation $B_ i$. It is guaranteed that each individual and corporation is involved in at least one lawsuit. Note that it is possible for the same pair of one individual and one corporation to be involved in more than one lawsuit. -----Output----- Output $L$ lines, where the $i^\text {th}$ of these lines contains either INDV$A_ i$ or CORP $B_ i$, describing the party Kattis should rule in favor of for the $i^\text {th}$ lawsuit, such that the maximum number of lawsuits any single individual or corporation wins is minimized. If there are multiple correct answers, you can output any of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 8 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 3 3 4 3 5 3 Sample Output: INDV 1 INDV 2 CORP 1 INDV 4 CORP 2 INDV 3 CORP 3 INDV 5
