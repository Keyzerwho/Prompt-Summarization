 You are given a sequence of positive integers $n$. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input begins with a line with two space-separated integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 20000$) and $k$ ($1 \le k \le \min (100,n)$), where $n$ is the number of positive integers in the original sequence, and $k$ is the number of regions in the partition. The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $v$ ($1 \le v \le 1000000$). This is the sequence to be partitioned, in order. -----Output----- Output a single integer representing the maximum score possible partitioning the sequence of $n$ positive integers into $k$ regions. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 10 5 4 8 3 Sample Output: 2
