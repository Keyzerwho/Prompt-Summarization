 
-----Input----- The first line contains four floating point numbers, $X_ A$, $Y_ A$, $X_ B$, and $Y_ B$. They describe the coordinates of your initial location $A = (X_ A,Y_ A)$ and your final location $B = (X_ B,Y_ B)$. The second line contains an integer $N$, the number of conveyors in the hall ($0 \leq N \leq 100$). The following $N$ lines each contain four floating point numbers, $X_1$, $Y_1$, $X_2$, and $Y_2$, describing a conveyor which starts at the point $(X_1,Y_1)$ and ends at the point $(X_2,Y_2)$, running in a straight line from start to end. All coordinates are floating point numbers in the range ($0 \leq X, Y \leq 1000.0$), expressed in units of meters, given with at most $6$ decimals after the decimal point. Conveyors are at least $1$ meter long. Conveyors do not intersect or touch. Your start and destination are not on any conveyor. -----Output----- Write one line with a floating point number, the minimum time (in seconds) needed to get from $A$ to $B$ in seconds. Your answer may have an absolute error of at most $10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 60.0 0.0 50.0 170.0 3 40.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 20.0 5.0 170.0 95.0 0.0 95.0 80.0 Sample Output 1: 168.7916512460 Sample Input 2: 60.0 0.0 50.0 170.0 3 40.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 20.0 5.0 170.0 95.0 0.0 95.0 100.0 Sample Output 2: 163.5274740179 Sample Input 3: 0.0 1.0 4.0 1.0 1 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.0 Sample Output 3: 3.7320508076
