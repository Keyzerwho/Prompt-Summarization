 You are given $n$ pairs of numbers. For each pair of numbers, you need to decide the operation to perform. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with one integer $n$ ($1\leq n \leq 2500$), the number of pairs of numbers;  - $n$ lines each with two integers $a$ and $b$ ($-10^6 \leq a, b \leq 10^6$), a pair of numbers used. -----Output----- For each pair of numbers $(a,b)$ in the same order as in the input, output a line containing a valid equation. Each equation should consist of five parts: $a$, one of the three operators, $b$, an equals sign ($=$), and the result of the expression. All the $n$ expression results must be different. If there are multiple valid answers you may output any of them. If there is no valid answer, output a single line with the string “impossible” instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 5 3 3 4 5 -1 -6 Sample Output: 1 + 5 = 6 3 * 3 = 9 4 - 5 = -1 -1 - -6 = 5
