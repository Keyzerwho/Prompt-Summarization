 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizontal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains a single integer $1\leq n\leq 10^5$, the number of cards in the deck.  - The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $1\leq a_1, a_2, \dotsc , a_ n \leq n$, where $a_ i$ is the new position of the card previously at position $i$ when Alice shuffles the deck.  - The third line contains $n$ distinct integers $1\leq b_1,b_2,\dotsc , b_ n\leq n$, where $b_ i$ is the new position of the card previously at position $i$ when Bob shuffles the deck. -----Output-----  - Output a single positive integer $m > 0$, the minimal number of shuffles required to sort the deck, or huge when this number is strictly larger than $10^{12}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 3 1 3 1 2 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 6 5 1 6 3 2 4 4 6 5 1 3 2 Sample Output 2: 5
