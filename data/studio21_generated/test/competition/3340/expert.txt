 You are given $n$ cities. The $i$-th city has a number $i$. The $i$-th city is served by $n - 1$ flights. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i + 1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i -1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i + 1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i -1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i + 1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i -1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i + 1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $i$ to city $i -1$. The $i$-th flight goes from city $
-----Input----- The first line in the input contains the integer $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 2500$), the number of cities NCPC Airways operates in. Then follow $n - 1$ lines specifying the flights. Each flight is given as a pair of cities $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le n$). -----Output----- The output should consist of three lines. The first line should contain an integer, the minimum number of flights needed to take when travelling between any pair of cities after changing one of the flights. The second line should contain two integers, specifying the two cities between which the flight should be canceled. The third line should contain two integers, specifying the two cities where a new flight should be added. If there are more than one optimal solution, any one of them will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 Sample Output: 2 3 4 2 4
