 You are given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You should determine the number of months required to get all the state governors to be members of the same party. 
-----Input----- There will be a single test case in the input. This test case will begin with a line with two integers, $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) and $m$ ($n-1 \le m \le n(n-1)/2$), where $n$ is the number of governors, and $m$ is the number of known friendships. On the next line will be $n$ integers, either $0$ or $1$, indicating the current party affiliation of the governors, in order ($0=\text {ORANGE}, 1=\text {PURPLE}$). On each of the following $m$ lines will be two integers, $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a < b \le n$) indicating that governor $a$ and governor $b$ are friends. As in life, friendships go both ways: if $a$ is a friend of $b$, then $b$ is also a friend of $a$. All $m$ $(a,b)$ pairs will be unique. -----Output----- Output a single integer, indicating the minimum number of months necessary for every governor to belong to the same party. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 0 1 0 0 1 2 2 3 2 4 Sample Output: 1
