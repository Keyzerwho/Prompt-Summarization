 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 K_1 : A_N K_N -----Output----- If Takahashi will win, print Takahashi; if Aoki will win, print Aoki. -----Sample Input----- 2 5 2 3 3 -----Sample Output----- Aoki Initially, from the first pile at most floor(5/2)=2 stones can be removed at a time, and from the second pile at most floor(3/3)=1 stone can be removed at a time.  - If Takahashi first takes two stones from the first pile, from the first pile at most floor(3/2)=1 stone can now be removed at a time, and from the second pile at most floor(3/3)=1 stone can be removed at a time.  - Then, if Aoki takes one stone from the second pile, from the first pile at most floor(3/2)=1 stone can be removed at a time, and from the second pile no more stones can be removed (since floor(2/3)=0).  - Then, if Takahashi takes one stone from the first pile, from the first pile at most floor(2/2)=1 stone can now be removed at a time, and from the second pile no more stones can be removed.  - Then, if Aoki takes one stone from the first pile, from the first pile at most floor(1/2)=0 stones can now be removed at a time, and from the second pile no more stones can be removed. No more operation can be performed, thus Aoki wins. If Takahashi plays differently, Aoki can also win by play accordingly.
