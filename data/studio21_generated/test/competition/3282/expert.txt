 You are given an array of numbers. Make sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line with one integer representing the price $P$ which Quido pays for each lunch. The value of $P$ is positive and less than $10^{18}$. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of times Quido can have a free dessert at Hugoâ€™s restaurant, provided that the price of his lunch is always $P$. Next, the possible bills which result in a free dessert are listed in ascending order with respect to the beverage price. Each bill consists of the price of the beverage followed by the price of the main dish. For simplicity, the value $P$, which is always the same, is not included in the bill. If there are more than $5000$ possible bills, then output only the first $5000$ bills (but still report the total number of possible bills before the list of bills). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 37 Sample Output 1: 4 8 29 9 28 11 26 15 22 Sample Input 2: 30014 Sample Output 2: 7 85 29929 88 29926 785 29229 788 29226 7785 22229 7788 22226 7789 22225
