 You are given an array of integers. You need to arrange them in such a way that each node has a value. Each node can have either 0 or 2 children. 
-----Input----- The first line has an odd integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 25$). The second line has $n$ positive integers no larger than $10^9$, giving the values of the nodes. -----Output----- Output the number of ways to arrange the given nodes into an LCM tree, modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 2 3 4 4 8 12 24 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 3 7 7 7 Sample Output 2: 3 Sample Input 3: 5 1 2 3 2 1 Sample Output 3: 0
