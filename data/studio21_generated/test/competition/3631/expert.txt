 You are given the list of beacons and a list of mountains.  You need to output the number of messages that have to be sent by riders when an enemy threatens the country. 
-----Input----- The first line in the input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$) and $m$ ($0 \leq m \leq 1000$) the number of beacons and the number of mountain peaks, respectively. Then follow $n$ lines specifying the locations of the beacons. The location of each beacon is given as a pair of integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \le x, y \le 10000$). Then follow $m$ lines describing the mountain peaks. Each mountain peak is given as a pair of integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \le x, y \le 10000$) specifying the location of the peak and a radius $r$ ($1 \le r \le 5000$). -----Output----- The output should be a single integer: the number of messages that must be carried by riders for all beacons to be lit. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 3 1 8 5 4 7 7 9 2 16 6 17 10 4 7 2 6 3 1 12 6 3 Sample Output: 2
