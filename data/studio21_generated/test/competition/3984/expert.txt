 You are given a string $s$ and a number $k$ ($0 \le k < |s|$). At the beginning of the game, players are given a substring of $s$ with left border $l$ and right border $r$, both equal to $k$ (i.e. initially $l=r=k$). Then players start to make moves one by one, according to the following rules: A player chooses $l^{\prime}$ and $r^{\prime}$ so that $l^{\prime} \le l$, $r^{\prime} \ge r$ and $s[l^{\prime}, r^{\prime}]$ is lexicographically less than $s[l, r]$. Then the player changes $l$ and $r$ in this way: $l := l^{\prime}$, $r := r^{\prime}$. Ann moves first. The player, that can't make a move loses. Recall that a substring $s[l
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single string $s$ ($1 \leq |s| \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$) consisting of lowercase English letters. -----Output----- Print $|s|$ lines. In the line $i$ write the name of the winner (print Mike or Ann) in the game with string $s$ and $k = i$, if both play optimally -----Examples----- Input abba Output Mike Ann Ann Mike Input cba Output Mike Mike Mike
