 Given an array an of integers write a function that will return the 9 last digits of the sum of all prices. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 500000$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains a member of Mirko’s array. The members of the array will be integers from the interval $[1, 10^8 ]$. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain an integer, the last $9$ digits of the required sum from the task. You don’t need to output the leading zeroes of that 9-digit integer. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 3 Sample Output 1: 16 Sample Input 2: 4 2 4 1 4 Sample Output 2: 109
