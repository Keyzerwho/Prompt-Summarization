 You are given $n$ areas connected with $m$ one-way passages. Unnar starts in area $1$ and wants to get to area $n$. Every passage contains an enemy but the areas are safe. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $1 \leq A, H \leq 10^9$ where $A$ denotes Unnar’s attack points and $H$ his health points. The second line contains $1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$ where $n$ is the number of ares in the cave and $m$ the number of passages. The next $m$ lines contain four integers $1 \leq e_ i, b_ i \leq n$ and $1 \leq a_ i, h_ i \leq 10^9$, indicating a passage from area $e_ i$ to $b_ i$ whose enemy has $a_ i$ attack points and $h_ i$ health points. -----Output----- If Unnar can’t get through the cave-system output ‘Oh no’, without the quotes. Otherwise output the maximum health Unnar can have after getting through the cave-system. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 Sample Output 1: Oh no Sample Input 2: 1 3 3 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 Sample Output 2: 1
