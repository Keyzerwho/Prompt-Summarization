 You are given an array of integers. You need to find the number of liftings needed. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$, $1 \leq M \leq 1000$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains $M$ integers, the $i$-th line describing the current state of the $i$-th shelf. Number $0$ denotes an empty place on the shelf, and a number different than $0$ denotes that there is a book in that place denoted with that number. All books are denoted with different numbers from $1$ to $K$, where $K$ is the total number of books on the shelves. After that, an additional $N$ lines follow, each containing $M$ integers, the $i$-th line describing the wanted state of the $i$-th shelf. In the initial and final state of the shelves, the same books will appear. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required minimal number of lifting or $-1$ if it is impossible to arrange the books in the aforementioned way. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 4 1 0 2 0 3 5 4 0 2 1 0 0 3 0 4 5 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 3 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 4 2 3 6 5 1 0 7 8 Sample Output 2: 4
