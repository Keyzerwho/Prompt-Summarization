 You are given two warlords $w_1$ and $w_2$. They are fighting over space, and they want to share the infinite area between them. The warlord $w_1$ has the biggest battle fleet, and the warlord $w_2$ has the second biggest fleet. The warlords $w_1$ and $w_2$ each get their own sector, but each warlord wants his sector to be infinite. The warlords $w_1$ and $w_2$ will each get at least one infinite sector, so how many lines do you have to add to make sure each warlord can get at least one infinite sector? 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two positive integers $W$ and $N$, ($1 \leq W,N \leq 100$) denoting the number of warlords and the number of lines in the suggested division of space. This is followed by $N$ lines each containing four integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$ and $y_2$, each with an absolute value no higher than $10000$. This means that one line is intersecting the two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on the galactic map. These two points are not be the same. -----Output----- Output the number of lines you have to add to this suggestion to satisfy all warlords. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 1 1 -2 0 Sample Output: 0
