Aunt Mito is happy that Gon has become a Hunter and has visited home. But at the same time, she feels worried about Gon   the life of a Hunter is challenging. Thus, she will not allow Gon to leave  While Island , unless Gon is able to solve a puzzle prepared by aunt Mito. But what puzzle should Mito give to Gon  Mito opened  IMO 2019 Problems  and found the following problem: The Bank of Bath issues coins with an $H$ on one side and a $T$ on the other. Prof. Tuy has $n$ of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: if there are exactly $k > 0$ coins showing $H$, then he turns over the $k$-th coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show $T$ and he stops. For example, if $n = 3$ the process starting with the configuration $THT$ would be: $THT \rightarrow HHT \rightarrow HTT \rightarrow TTT$, which stops after three operations. Show that, for each
-----Input----- The input contains a single non-empty line with at most $10^6$ characters — the sequence $S$. -----Output----- The output must contain a single number — the average value of $L(C)$, as explained in the statement. Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn’t exceed $10^{-6}$. Namely: let’s assume that your answer is $a$, and the answer of the jury is $b$. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,b)} \leq 10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: HH Sample Output 1: 2.0 Sample Input 2: H? Sample Output 2: 1.5
