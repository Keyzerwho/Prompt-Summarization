 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100000$), the number of planets. The next $N$ lines contain exactly $3$ integers each. All integers are between $-10^9$ and $10^9$ inclusive. Each line contains the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinate of one planet (in order). No two planets will occupy the exact same point in space. -----Output----- The first and only line of output should contain the minimal cost of forming the network of tunnels. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 1 5 10 7 8 2 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 3 -1 -1 -1 5 5 5 10 10 10 Sample Output 2: 11
