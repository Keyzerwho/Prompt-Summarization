 
-----Input----- Each test case will begin with a line with two space-separated integers $n$ ($1\! \le \! n\! \le \! 10^5$) and $m$ ($0\! \le \! m\! \le \! 10^5$), where $n$ is the number of cities and $m$ is the number of train lines. The cities are numbered $1..n$. Each of the next $m$ lines contains two space separated integers $a$ and $b$ ($1\! \le \! a,b\! \le \! n, a\! \neq \! b$), which indicates that there is a train line from city $a$ to city $b$ (but not back). All train lines will be distinct. -----Output----- Produce exactly two lines of output. On the first line, output a single integer, which is the minimum number of flights Per must take to visit all of the cities. On the second line, output a list of space-separated integers, which are the cities with airports he can visit. If he can visit an airport on any one of the routes with the minimum number of flights, it should be listed. Output these numbers in increasing order. If no airports are to be visited, output a blank line. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 3 4 Sample Output: 1 1 2 3 4
