 You are given a set of size n. You need to count the number of binary relations over this set such that they are symmetric, transitive, but not an equivalence relations (i.e. they are not reflexive). 
-----Input----- A single line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4000). -----Output----- In a single line print the answer to the problem modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1 Input 2 Output 3 Input 3 Output 10 -----Note----- If n = 1 there is only one such relation — an empty one, i.e. $\rho = \varnothing$. In other words, for a single element x of set A the following is hold: [Image]. If n = 2 there are three such relations. Let's assume that set A consists of two elements, x and y. Then the valid relations are $\rho = \varnothing$, ρ = {(x, x)}, ρ = {(y, y)}. It is easy to see that the three listed binary relations are symmetric and transitive relations, but they are not equivalence relations.
