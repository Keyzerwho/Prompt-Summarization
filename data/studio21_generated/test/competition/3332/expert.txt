     You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer $n$, where $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5000$) is the number of data streams. Each of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $s_ i$, $d_ i$, $p_ i$ ($1 \le s_ i,d_ i \le 10^9$, $0 \le p_ i \le 100000$) describing one data stream, where $s_ i$ is its start time, $d_ i$ is the duration of the stream, and $p_ i$ is its priority. Note that the cluster has at least $5000$ processors. -----Output----- Display the maximum total priority of a subset of streams such that their reports can be generated with the architecture described above using a single OGU. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 3 6 2 5 8 3 3 5 5 3 6 Sample Output: 13
