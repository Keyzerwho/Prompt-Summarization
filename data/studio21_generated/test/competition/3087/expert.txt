 Given two photos, can you help Marek reconstruct the arrows on the floor so that each arrow connects two different marks  On the two photos it can be seen for every person to which position he or she moved. Marek therefore numbered the people in the first photo from $1$ to $N$ and then wrote the number of the person whose place they took in the second photo. Marek s time is running out, so he is interested in any placement of arrows that could produce the two photos. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $K$, $2 \le N \le 10000, 1\le K \le 10^9$. The second line of the input contains $N$ space separated integers $a_1, \dots , a_ N$, denoting that dancer number $i$ ended at the place of dancer number $a_ i$. You may assume that $1 \le a_ i \le N$ for all $i$ and every number between $1$ and $N$ inclusive appears exactly once in the sequence. -----Output----- If it is impossible to find a placement of arrows such that the dance performed $K$ times would produce the two photos, print “Impossible”. Otherwise print $N$ numbers on a line, the $i$-th number denoting to which person the arrow leads from person number $i$. Note that the $i$-th number cannot be $i$, because then the person would not move the whole time. If there are more solutions, you can print any one. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 Sample Output 1: 5 6 1 2 3 4  Sample Input 2: 4 2 3 4 1 2 Sample Output 2: 2 3 4 1
