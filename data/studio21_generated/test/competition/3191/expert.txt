 You are given an integer N, and an integer M (0 <= M <= 10^9). Your task is to write a program which computes the minimum worst-case time to find the crashing line (no matter where it is), assuming you choose an optimal strategy for placing your printf statements. We re releasing the new version in five hours, so this issue is escalated and needs to be fixed ASAP. 
-----Input----- The input consists of one line with three integers:  - $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), the number of code lines;  - $r$ ($1 \le r \le 10^9$), the amount of time it takes to compile and run the program until it crashes;  - $p$ ($1 \le p \le 10^9$), the time it takes to add a single printf line. You have already run the program once and therefore already know that it does crash somewhere. -----Output----- Output the worst-case time to find the crashing line when using an optimal strategy. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 100 20 Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 10 10 1 Sample Output 2: 19
