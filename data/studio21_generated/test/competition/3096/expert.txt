 You are given a list $L$ of distinct integers and a list $V$ of distinct integers. For each integer $i$ in $L$, write a function that returns the number of $i$ such that $i$ is superior (directly or indirectly) to $V$. For example, $(3, 1, 2)$ and $(5, 1, 2, 4, 3)$.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$, ($1 \leq N \leq 10\ 000$). The second line of input contains $N$ integers, the types of jokes person $i$ tells, $V_ i$, ($1 \leq V_ i \leq 100$). Each of the following $N-1$ lines contains two integers $A$ and $B$, ($1 \leq A, B \leq N$), denoting that person $A$ is directly superior to person $B$. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the number of different sets of jokes that comply to the previously listed constraints. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 2 1 3 4 1 2 1 3 3 4 Sample Output 1: 6 Sample Input 2: 4 3 4 5 6 1 2 1 3 2 4 Sample Output 2: 3
