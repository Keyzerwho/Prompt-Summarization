 You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You are also given an integer $k$. Your goal is to construct a forest consisting of $k$ vertices and $m$ edges. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself). 
-----Input----- The first line of the input is a single integer $0 \le V \le 100$, the number of vertices in his forest. The next line contains $V$ integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots , d_ V$ ($0 \le d_ i \le 100$ for all $i$). These are the degrees which Anton wants the vertices to have. -----Output----- The first line of output should be IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to construct such a forest. Otherwise, the first line should be POSSIBLE. The next lines should then contain two integers $1 \le a, b \le V$ each, denoting an edge between vertices $a$ and $b$. Note that the vertex with number $a$ must have exactly degree $d_ a$, i.e. the ordering of the vertices is important. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 1 2 Sample Output 1: POSSIBLE 1 3 2 3 Sample Input 2: 2 1 2 Sample Output 2: IMPOSSIBLE
