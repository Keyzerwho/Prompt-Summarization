 You are given a list of pairs of port towns. You need to calculate the average shortest distance between all pairs of port towns. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 500$), the number of ports;  - $n-1$ lines, the $i$th of which contains $n-i$ integers. The $j$th integer on the $i$th line denotes the distance between port $i$ and port $i+j$ in kilometres. Each distance is between $1$ and $10^6$ (inclusive). You can assume that the distances correspond to a road network in which there is exactly one path between two port towns that does not visit the same place twice. All roads can be used in both directions. -----Output----- Output one line with the average distances in kilometres between all pairs of distance signs in Optimistan. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-9}$. If it is impossible to determine the exact average of distances between all pairs of distance signs in Optimistan, output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 4 4 2 Sample Output: 2.13333333333333
