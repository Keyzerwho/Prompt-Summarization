 You are given $n$ integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. 
-----Input----- The input is a single integer $n$. -----Output----- Output the supply for $n$ digit lucky numbers. -----Limits-----  - $2 \leq n \leq 1000$ -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 Sample Output: 45
