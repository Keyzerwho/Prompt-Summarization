     You are given 2 integer arrays of length $N$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line contains $N$, ($1 \leq N \leq 100000$). The next $N$ lines each contain two real numbers $L_ i$ and $R_ i$ ($1 \leq L_ i \leq R_ i \leq 10^6$). All real numbers in the input have at most $6$ digits after the decimal point. -----Output----- Output one number: expected payment divided by $N^2$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error is less than $10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1.2 10.2 2.2 15.2 Sample Output: 1.114672365
