 You are given a list of $N$ integers and $K$. Return the number of fields attacked after $P$ moves. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains integers $N$, $K$, $P$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$, $1 \leq K \leq 100\ 000$, $1 \leq P \leq 100\ 000$). Each of the following $K$ lines contains three integers $R$, $C$, $X$ ($1 \leq R, C \leq N$, $1 \leq X \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$) which denote that initially there is a rook of power $X$ on the field $(R, C)$. Each of the following $P$ lines contains four integers $R_1$, $C_1$, $R_2$, $C_2$ ($1 \leq R_1, C_1, R_2, C_2 \leq N$) which denote that the rook has moved from field $(R_1, C_1 )$ to field $(R_2, C_2 )$. It is guaranteed that there will not be two rooks on one field at any point. -----Output----- The output must consist of $P$ lines, the $k$-th line containing the total number of attacked fields after $k$ moves. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 Sample Output 1: 4 0 Sample Input 2: 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 Sample Output 2: 4 2
