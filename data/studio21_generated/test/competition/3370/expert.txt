 You are given a connected graph of $n$ nodes and $m$ bidirectional edges. For each node $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, you need to find a minimum spanning tree. Then output the final height of the house that ends up tallest. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of an integer $N$ and real number $k$, separated by a space $(1 \leq N \leq 100000; 0 \leq k \leq 10^{20})$: the number of houses in Eagleton and the number of inches each citizen wants their own house to be taller than the average of their neighbors. $N$ lines follow. The $i$th such line (starting at $i=1$) contains a real number $h_ i$ ($0 \leq h_ i \leq 10^{20}$), the initial height (in inches) of house $i$. The real numbers in the input may be provided in scientific notation (see for instance Sample Input 2) and will have at most ten digits after the decimal point. -----Output----- Print the height (in inches) of the tallest house, after all houses have been remodeled over infinitely many days of the process described above. Your answer will be judged correct if the absolute or relative error is within $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 39 10 40 Sample Output: 40.5
