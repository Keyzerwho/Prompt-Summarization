 You are given $n$ and $m$. You are given a list of numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and a list of numbers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$. You need to return the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 1000$) — number of planets. The second line contains the only integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 1000$) — weight of the payload. The third line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 1000$), where $a_i$ is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel. The fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \le b_i \le 1000$), where $b_i$ is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel.  It is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel. -----Output----- If Natasha can fly to Mars through $(n - 2)$ planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number $-1$. It is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than $10^9$ tons of fuel. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. Formally, let your answer be $p$, and the jury's answer be $q$. Your answer is considered correct if $\frac{|p - q|}{\max{(1, |q|)}} \le 10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Input 2 12 11 8 7 5 Output 10.0000000000 Input 3 1 1 4 1 2 5 3 Output -1 Input 6 2 4 6 3 3 5 6 2 6 3 6 5 3 Output 85.4800000000 -----Note----- Let's consider the first example. Initially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is $22$ tons. At take-off from Earth one ton of fuel can lift off $11$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $22$ tons you need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight of the rocket with fuel is $20$ tons. During landing on Mars, one ton of fuel can land $5$ tons of cargo, so for landing $20$ tons you will need to burn $4$ tons of fuel. There will be $16$ tons of the rocket with fuel remaining. While taking off from Mars, one ton of fuel can raise $8$ tons of cargo, so to lift off $16$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. There will be $14$ tons of rocket with fuel after that. During landing on Earth, one ton of fuel can land $7$ tons of cargo, so for landing $14$ tons you will need to burn $2$ tons of fuel. Remaining weight is $12$ tons, that is, a rocket without any fuel. In the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth.
