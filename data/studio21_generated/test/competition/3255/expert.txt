 You are given an array and values $D$ and $M$ computes the length of the longest exploration sequence in the array. summary :  
-----Input----- The first line contains three numbers $n$, $D$, $M$, where $n$ is the length of the array (as described above, $D$ is the maximum length of a jump the hopper can make, and $M$ is the maximum difference in values a hopper can handle). The next line contains $n$ integers—the entries of the array. We have $1 \leq D \leq 7$, $1 \leq M \leq 10000$, $1 \leq n \leq 1000$ and the integers in the array are between $-1000000$ and $1000000$. -----Output----- The output contains one line—the length of the longest exploration sequence. The hopper can start and end at any location and the length is computed as the number of visited locations. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 8 3 1 1 7 8 2 6 4 3 5 Sample Output 1: 8 Sample Input 2: 8 2 1 1 7 8 2 6 4 3 5 Sample Output 2: 3
