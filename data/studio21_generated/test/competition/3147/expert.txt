 You are given the layout of a memory matrix. You need to find the size of the largest square killer. 
-----Input----- The first will contain two integers, $R$ and $C$, smaller than or equal to $300$. The next $R$ lines will each contain $C$ characters (‘0’ or ‘1’) with no spaces. -----Output----- Output the size of the largest killer on a single line, or output $-1$ if there are no square killers. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 6 101010 111001 101001 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 4 5 10010 01010 10101 01001 Sample Output 2: 3
