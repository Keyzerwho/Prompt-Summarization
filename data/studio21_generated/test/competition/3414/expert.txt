 You are given two graphs (a graph is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges). You need to calculate the sum of turning required to drive on the shortest path between the two graphs. 
-----Input----- One line with $3 \leq N \leq 10000$ – the number of nodes – and $N \leq M \leq 2N$ – the number of edges. $N$ lines with the integer $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each node, in order. $0 \leq x, y \leq 10000$. The nodes have unique coordinate pairs. $M$ lines with two space separated integers $i$ and $j$, denoting an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$. The nodes are $0$-indexed. -----Output----- The least amount of turning you must do to complete an Eulerian circuit, in radians. The answer must be correct within an absolute or relative error of $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 1 2 Sample Output: 6.283185
