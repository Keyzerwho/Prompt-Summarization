 You are given KenKen puzzle. You need to find how many ways there are to fill that section. 
-----Input----- The input will start with a single line of the form $n$ $m$ $t$ $op$, where $n$ is the size of the KenKen puzzle containing the section to be described, $m$ is the number of grid squares in the section, $t$ is the target value and $op$ is either ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’ or ‘/’ indicating the arithmetic operator to use for the section. Next will follow $m$ grid locations of the form $r$ $c$, indicating the row and column number of the grid square. These grid square locations will take up one or more lines. All grid squares in a given section will be connected so that you can move from any one square in the section to any other by crossing shared lines between grid squares. The values of $n$, $m$ and $t$ will satisfy $4\leq n\leq 9$, $2 \leq m \leq 10$, $0 < t \le 3 \cdot 10^8$ and $1 \leq r,c \leq n$. -----Output----- Output the number of valid ways in which the section could be filled in for a KenKen puzzle of the given size. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 8 2 7 - 1 1 1 2 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 9 2 7 - 1 1 1 2 Sample Output 2: 4
