 You are given two arrays $A$ and $B$ of integers. For each $i$ of $A$ and $j$ of $B$, you need to find if $i$ and $j$ are adjacent. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input consists of a single integer $n$, indicating that there are $n$ children in the ring $(1 \leq n \leq 200000)$. The following $n$ lines describe the children you can see at different times. The $i$th line (indexed starting from zero) contains three space-separated non-negative integers $l_ i$, $r_ i$, $x_ i$ ($l_ i+r_ i+1\leq n,0\leq x_ i\leq 1$): you can see $l_ i+r_ i+1$ children when child $i$ is in the center of view ($l_ i$ to the left and $r_ i$ to the right of child $i$). If $x_ i=0$ then an even number of them are wearing the orange pumpkin costume. If $x_ i=1$ then an odd number of them are wearing the orange pumpkin costume. -----Output----- Compute the number of ways of assigning a costume to each child, consistent with your observations. Since this number might be large, print the result modulo $10^9 + 7$. (If itâ€™s impossible to find any costume assignment that matches all parity constraints, print 0). -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1 0 0 1 0 1 3 0 1 3 0 0 3 0 1 Sample Output: 0
