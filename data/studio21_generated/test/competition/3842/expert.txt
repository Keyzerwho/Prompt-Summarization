 You are given numbers p, q, m, n, a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3. You are given an array of strings of only 0's and 1's. Return the maximum value that can be obtained with using less than (m+1) 0's and (n+1) 1's in total. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers n, p and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ p, q ≤ 1 000 000) — the number of projects and the required number of experience and money. Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 1 000 000) — the daily increase in experience and daily income for working on the i-th project. -----Output----- Print a real value — the minimum number of days Mikhail needs to get the required amount of experience and money. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.  Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Input 3 20 20 6 2 1 3 2 6 Output 5.000000000000000 Input 4 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 Output 0.400000000000000 -----Note----- First sample corresponds to the example in the problem statement.
