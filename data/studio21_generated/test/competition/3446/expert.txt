 You are given an array of components. You need to assemble them. The input to your program will be a set of symbols representing (types of) pieces, and a so-called assembly table representing the time it takes to assemble them, as well as the type of the resulting component. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. This test case begins with a line containing a natural number $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 26$), followed by a line with $k$ symbols (characters in $[a-z]$) separated by spaces. The following $k$ lines contain the assembly table: the $i$-th line has $k$ pairs of the form $\mathit{time}$-$\mathit{result}$, where $\mathit{time}$ is an integer between $0$ and $1000000$ inclusive, and $\mathit{result}$ a symbol belonging to the preceding set. The $j$-th pair in the $i$-th line represents the time to compose pieces of types represented by the $i$-th and $j$-th symbols, along with the type of the resulting piece. After the table, a line with an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10$) indicates the number of lines that follow, each line containing a non-empty string over the $k$ symbols. Each of these lines is a sequence of components that need to be assembled together in the right order. The sum of lengths of the $n$ lines is at most $200$. After the single test case follows a line containing 0, which should not be processed. -----Output----- Print $n$ lines, each with an integer $\mathit{time}$ and a symbol $\mathit{result}$ in the format $\mathit{time}$-$\mathit{result}$. Each line represents the minimum time and the type of the resulting piece for the corresponding case in the input. In case of a tie among several possible results with the same minimum time, choose from among those the piece whose type letter appears first in the line that contained the $k$ symbols at the beginning of the test case. (For example, if that line was $a$ $c$ $b$ and both $c$ and $b$ can be obtained with minimum cost $5$, print $5$-$c$). -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 a b 3-b 5-b 6-a 2-b 2 aba bba 0 Sample Output: 9-b 8-a
