 You are given an $N \times N$ table, where non-negative integers are written in each field. You are given $K$ dominoes, which will cover each field that is too large. The dominoes do not overlap. You are required to find the minimum possible sum of visible fields. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 2000$), the dimensions of the table, and $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 8$), the number of dominoes. Each of the following $N$ lines contains $N$ integers from the interval $[0, 1000]$. These $N \times N$ numbers describe Mirkoâ€™s table. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the minimal sum of visible fields after covering the table with dominoes. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 2 7 6 9 5 1 4 3 8 Sample Output: 31
