 You have $N$ barbarians and $Q$ rounds. Each round, Tarzan shows a word $P$ to the barbarians. In round $S$, Tarzan asks the barbarian denoted with $S$ the following question:  Out of all the words I ve shown you so far, how many of them have the word on your stone tablet as a consecutive substring   Given the fact that the barbarians go wild a lot and aren t really able to pay attention and keep up with what s happening in the game, they need your help. Help the barbarians answer each of Tarzan s questions correctly. 


-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$), the number of barbarians. Each of the following $N$ lines contains a single word consisting of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, the $i$-th word corresponding to the word on the stone tablet of barbarian denoted with $i$. After that, the integer $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$) follows, the number of rounds in the game. The following $Q$ lines describe the round of the game, the $i$-th line describing the $i$-th round of the game. Each line will contain the integer $T$. In the case when $T$ is equal to 1, it denotes the first type of round and the shown word $P$ follows in the same line, consisting of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet. In the case when $T$ is equal to 2, it denotes the second type of round and the number $S$ ($1 \leq S \leq N$) follows in the same line, the label of the barbarian whom Tarzan asked the question. The total length of all words written on the barbarians’ stone tablets will not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$. The total length of all words that Tarzan shows the barbarians will not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$. -----Output----- For each round of the second form, output a single line. The $i$-th line must contain the correct answer to Tarzan’s question in the $i$-th round of type 2. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 a bc abc 3 1 abca 2 1 2 3 Sample Output: 1 1
