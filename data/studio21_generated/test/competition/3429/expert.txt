 You are given N values with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integers $x_ s, y_ s, s_ s, r_ i, r_ f$. You are guaranteed that $|x_ s|, |y_ s|\leq 10^9$, $0<s_ s\leq 10^9$, and $0<r_ f\leq r_ i\leq 10^9$. The second line of the input contains integers $x_ a, y_ a, s_ a$. You are guaranteed that $|x_ a|, |y_ a|\leq 10^9$ and $0<s_ a\leq 10^9$. -----Output----- A single number $d$ denoting the minimum amount of damage Anthony will take. You are required to output $d$ with absolute precision $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 1 3 2 2 5 1 Sample Output: 2.000000
