 Given an array of integers, calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will consist of exactly two lines. The first line will contain a string $R$ ($1 \le |R| \le 50$), consisting only of the characters $0$ and $1$. These are the row parities, in order. The second line will contain a string $C$ ($1 \le |C| \le 50$), consisting only of the characters $0$ and $1$. These are the column parities, in order. -----Output----- If it is possible to recover the original matrix with the given constraints, then output the matrix as $|R|$ lines of exactly $|C|$ characters, consisting only of $0$’s and $1$’s. If it is not possible to recover the original matrix, output $-1$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 0110 1001 Sample Output 1: 1111 0111 1110 1111 Sample Input 2: 0 1 Sample Output 2: -1
