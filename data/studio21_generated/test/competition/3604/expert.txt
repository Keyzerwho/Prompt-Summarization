 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n \le 100$ and $1 \le d \le 10000$), where $n$ is the number of sensors available and $d$ is the maximum distance between sensors that can communicate directly. Sensors are numbered $1$ to $n$. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($-10000\le x, y \le 10000$) indicating the sensor coordinates, starting with the first sensor. -----Output----- Display a maximum subset of sensors in which each pair of sensors can communicate directly. The first line of output should be the size of the subset. The second line of output should be the (one-based) indices of the sensors in the subset. If there are multiple such subsets, any one of them will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Sample Output: 2 1 2
