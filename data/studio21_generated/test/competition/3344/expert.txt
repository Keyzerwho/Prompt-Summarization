 You are given a circular conveyor belt moving at constant speed $1$ m/s. A straight conveyor moves at variable speed. You need to output the maximum speed of the straight conveyor so that no collisions occur. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two positive integers $N$ and $L$ ($1 \leq N \leq L \leq 1000$), where $N$ is the number of pieces of luggage and $L$ is the length of the circular conveyor belt in meters. The second line contains $N$ unique space-separated numbers $x_ i$ ($0 \leq x_ i \leq 1000$) with two digits after the decimal point, denoting luggage positions in meters. -----Output----- Output the maximum speed $v$ in m/s ($0.1 \leq v \leq 10$) that makes sure no collisions will occur, or “no fika” if there is no such speed. The answer is considered correct if it has an absolute error of at most $10^{-9}$. You may assume that when an optimal $v$ exists, each speed in the interval $[v - 10^{-9}, v]$ will also be a valid speed. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 3 0.00 2.00 Sample Output: 2
