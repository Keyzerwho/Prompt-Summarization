 You are given two arrays $A$ and $B$. In one step, you can either add an element of $A$ to an element of $B$, or subtract an element of $B$ from an element of $A$. Return the minimum number of steps required before both arrays are of equal size. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100000$), the number of points describing the walk of Shadow. The next $n$ lines contain $2$ integers each, giving the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of Shadowâ€™s walk. Two consecutive points in the walk always differ in at least one coordinate. All coordinates are non-negative and at most $10000$. Similarly, the next line contains an integer $m$ ($2 \le m \le 100000$), the number of points describing the walk of Lydia. The next $m$ lines describe its walk in the same format as for Shadow. -----Output----- Output the minimum distance between the two dogs during their walks. The numbers should be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 0 0 10 0 2 30 0 15 0 Sample Output: 10
