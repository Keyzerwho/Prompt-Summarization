 Two kids have some candy. Each kid likes some candy more and some candy less. Find the minimum possible value. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100$), the number of candies the siblings have collected. The next line contains the $N$ integers $a_1, a_2 \dots , a_ N$ ($-100 \le a_ i \le 100$). The third and final line contains the $N$ integers $b_1, b_2 \dots , b_ N$ ($-100 \le b_ i \le 100$). -----Output----- Output a string containing $N$ characters. The $i$â€™th character should be A if the candy should be given to Alf, and B if it should be given to Beata. If there are multiple solutions, output the lexicographically smallest one. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 -2 -1 0 1 2 2 1 0 -1 -2 Sample Output: AAAAA
