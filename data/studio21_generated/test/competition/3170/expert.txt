 From her friends, Theta learned a $2$-player card game called Trash. Trash is played with a standard $52$-card deck consisting of Ace, $2$ to $10$, Jack, Queen, and King in each of the $4$ suits. Each player is dealt $10$ cards face down that are arranged in $2$ rows for each player as shown in the figure. The first row represents slots for an ace, a $2$, a $3$, a $4$, and a $5$ of any suit, the second row represents slots for $6$, $7$, $8$, $9$, $10$ of any suit. The first player who can fill all $10$ of their slots with a card of the appropriate kind wins. Players take turns to play Trash. At the beginning of each turn, a player draws from the drawing pile, which initially contains all cards that have not been dealt face-down. If the player can use the card drawn to fill one of their slots that has not been filled, they uncover and remove the face-down card from the slot and put the drawn card face up in the slot. Then, the player repeats their turn with the card uncovered (instead of
-----Input----- Input consists of a single string denoting the shuffled deck, which consists of $52$ characters, with each of A, J, Q, K, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and T appearing exactly $4$ times. Since the suit of a card does not matter for the game, it is not given in the input. 2 - 9 stand for cards $2$ to $9$, T stands for $10$, and A, J, Q, and K stand for Ace, Jack, Queen, and King. The first $10$ cards in the deck are dealt face-down to Theta, with the first card in her Ace/$1$ slot, the second card in her $2$ slot, and so on. The next $10$ cards are dealt to her friend, with the $11^{\texttt{th}}$ in the Ace/$1$ slot, and so on. The $21^{\texttt{st}}$ card in the deck is the first card drawn. Neither player is allowed to look at their face-down cards. Theta starts the game. You are guaranteed that one player will be able to win before the deck runs out of cards. -----Output----- If Theta wins this game with her strategy, output “Theta wins”. Otherwise, output “Theta loses”. Do not add a period to the output. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 23456789TJ23456789TJA89Q66JK37T2A4AQK3AK5T8Q24K97JQ5 Sample Output 1: Theta wins Sample Input 2: 89724TJTA67K4J87Q8T6Q7J2324T558KA99A3KA356QJ6523QK49 Sample Output 2: Theta wins
