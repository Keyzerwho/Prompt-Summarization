 You are given an array of length $N$ and you want to split it into several non-empty sets. The value of $i$-th element is $a_i$. You want to generate the maximum number of sets from the list. There is a restriction for each set: the number of values in the team multiplied by the minimum value among all values in the team must be at least $x$. Each value should belong to at most one set. Some value may be left without being part of any set. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 100)$, how many numbers there are in the circle. The second line contains $N$ integers separated by single spaces. All numbers will be between $1$ and $1000$ (inclusive). No two numbers will be the same. -----Output----- Output the desired number on a single line. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 3 1 5 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 4 1 2 3 4 Sample Output 2: 2
