 You are given an array of integers. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains $3$ integers $R$, $C$ and $K$. $(1 \le R, C \le 50, 1 \le K \le 10^9)$. In the next $R$ line, the $i$-th line contains exactly $C$ characters. Each character can be one of the following:  - ‘.’, representing an empty space.  - ‘X’, representing an obstacle.  - ‘R’, representing a conveyor belt, which is already set to right.  - ‘L’, representing a conveyor belt, which is already set to left.  - ‘?’, representing a conveyor belt, which is not yet set. The last line of the input contains exactly $C$ integers. The $i$-th number, $a_ i$, represents the score in the $i$-th column in the last row. $(1 \le a_ i \le 10^9)$. -----Output----- Output contains a single integer — the maximum final score. -----Explanation for the first example----- We can set the conveyor belt in the first row to ‘R’ and the conveyor belt in the $4$th row to ‘L’, then drop the ball from the $4$-th column. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 5 2 R..?. .X... 100 100 7 100 8 Sample Output 1: 16 Sample Input 2: 2 3 1 X.. .?. 10 1000 1 Sample Output 2: 10
