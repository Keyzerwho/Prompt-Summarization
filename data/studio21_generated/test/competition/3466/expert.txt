 You are given a list of numbers, you need to find how many numbers in the list are divisible by the given number. 
-----Input----- The input consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers $m$ ($1 \le m \le 10^5$), which is the number of types of sweets, and $k$ ($0 \le k \le 10^5$), which is the number of sweets Danny has already eaten. The second line contains $m$ positive integers $a_1, \ldots , a_ m$. These numbers are proportional to $f_1, \ldots , f_ m$, that is, $\displaystyle f_ i = \frac{a_ i}{\sum _{j = 1}^m a_ j}$. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $a_ j$ is no larger than $10^5$. The third line contains $k$ integers $b_1, \ldots , b_ k$ ($1 \le b_ i \le m$), where each $b_ i$ denotes the type of sweet Danny bought and ate on the $i^\text {th}$ day. It is guaranteed that every prefix of this sequence (including the whole sequence) is balanced. -----Output----- Display the maximum number of additional sweets that Danny can buy and eat while keeping his diet continuously balanced. If there is no upper limit on the number of sweets, display the word forever. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 5 2 1 6 3 5 3 1 2 5 3 5 Sample Output: 1
