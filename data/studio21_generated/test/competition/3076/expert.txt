 Given an n-dimensional array, find for each value of k, the maximum sum of values of jewels that can be stolen. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will consist of two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$, where $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000000$) is the number of jewels in the exhibit, and $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100000$) is the maximum size of knapsack available to Edward. The next $n$ lines each will describe a jewel. Each line will consist of two space-separated integers $s$ and $v$, where $s$ ($1 \le s \le 300$) is the size of the jewel, and $v$ ($1 \le v \le 10^9$) is its value. Each jewel can only be taken once per knapsack, but each knapsack is an independent problem. -----Output----- Output $k$ integers separated by whitespace. The first integer should be the maximum value of jewels that will fit in a knapsack of size $1$. The second should be the maximum value of jewels in a knapsack of size $2$, and so on. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 9 2 8 1 1 3 4 5 100 Sample Output 1: 1 8 9 9 100 101 108 109 109 Sample Input 2: 5 7 2 2 3 8 2 7 2 4 3 8 Sample Output 2: 0 7 8 11 15 16 19
