 You are given N sectors and $K$. Each sector seats only fans of a certain team. Media companies want an exclusive, consecutive range of at least $K$ sectors. Additionally, since they want their coverage to look interesting, they also want that range of sectors to have fans wearing at least $C$ distinct colors. You need to find the maximum number of media companies that can be sold broadcasting rights, if all constraints must be satisfied. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers, $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 200000$), $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq N$) and $C$ ($1 \leq C \leq N$), the number of sectors in the stadium, the minimum number of consecutive sectors each media company wants, and the minimum number of distinct colors each media company wants, respectively. The second line of input contains $N$ integers, $A_1, A_2, \dots , A_ N$ ($1 \leq A_ i \leq 10^9$), the teams the fans assigned to each sector of the stadium support. -----Output----- Output a single integer on a line by itself, the maximum number of media companies that can be sold broadcasting rights. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 9 4 3 1 1 9 9 1 6 6 39 9 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 10 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 Sample Output 2: 2
