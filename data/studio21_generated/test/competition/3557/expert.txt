 You are given an array of numbers. Find the maximum sum of each number in the array. 
-----Input----- On the first line is a single integer $n$, ($3 \leq n \leq 100000$), the number of coaches in the train. On the second line follows $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots p_ n$, ($0 \leq p_ i \leq 100$ for each $i \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $) the number of passengers in each coach. On the third and final line follows a permutation of the numbers from $1$ to $n$ indicating the order in which the robbers blew up the coaches. -----Output----- A single integer, the maximum chaos that occurred during the robbery. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 5 10 2 5 2 4 5 1 3 Sample Output: 90
