 You are given two integers n and p. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n p in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n p appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of guests in the restaurant. The next line contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 50) — the guests' sizes in meters. The third line contains integer p (1 ≤ p ≤ 50) — the table's length in meters.  The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- In a single line print a real number — the answer to the problem. The answer will be considered correct, if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 4}. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 3 Output 1.3333333333 -----Note----- In the first sample the people will come in the following orders:   (1, 2, 3) — there will be two people in the restaurant;  (1, 3, 2) — there will be one person in the restaurant;  (2, 1, 3) — there will be two people in the restaurant;  (2, 3, 1) — there will be one person in the restaurant;  (3, 1, 2) — there will be one person in the restaurant;  (3, 2, 1) — there will be one person in the restaurant.  In total we get (2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 6 = 8 / 6 = 1.(3).
