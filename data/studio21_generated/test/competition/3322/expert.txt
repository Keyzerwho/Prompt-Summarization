 Given a set of $n$ fancy antiques (some of which may be knock-offs) and a set of $m$ fancy antique shops, your task is to buy one version of each antique. Suppose there are $k$ shops. You can only visit $k$ shops. There are $n$ antiques. Each antique can only be found at a single shop. The shops can get away with selling knock-off versions of some antiques. The shops can sell the knock-off version of some antiques at a higher price than the original. The shops can sell the original of some antiques at the same price as the knock-off. The shops can sell the knock-off of some antiques at the same price as the original. The shops can sell the original of some antiques at a higher price than the knock-off. The shops can sell the knock-off of some antiques at the same price as the original. The shops can sell the knock-off of some antiques at a higher price than the original. The shops can sell the original of some antiques at a higher price than the knock-off. The shops can sell the knock-off of some antiques at the same price as the original. The shops can sell the original of some antiques at a higher price than the knock-off. The shops can sell the knock-off of some antiques at the same price as the original. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will consist of three space-separated integers: $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le k \le m \le 40$). The next $n$ lines will each have four space separated integers, $a$, $p$, $b$ and $q$, describing an antique, where:  - $a$ is the index of the shop that sells the original version of the antique ($1 \le a \le m$)  - $p$ is the price of the original version of the antique at shop $a$ ($1 \le p \le 10^7$)  - $b$ is the index of the shop that sells the knock-off version of the antique ($1 \le b \le m$)  - $q$ is the price of the knock-off version of the antique at shop $b$ ($1 \le q \le 10^7$) -----Output----- If it is possible to collect all of the antiques while visiting no more than $k$ stores, then output the minimum cost. If it is not possible, output $-1$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 2 1 30 2 50 2 70 3 10 3 20 1 80 Sample Output: 60
