 You are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order  
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of the integers $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$), $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 100$), $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a,b \leq 200$). The following line consists of $k$ integers $t_ i$ ($-200 \leq t_ i \leq 200$), the tastiness of each of the flavours. The following $k$ lines each contain $k$ integers. The $j$th number on the $i$th line is the additional tastiness $u_{i,j}$ ($-200 \leq u_{i,j} \leq 200$). -----Output----- If it is impossible to get an ice cream with positive tastiness, display $0$. Otherwise, display the largest possible value of the quotient of the tastiness and the cost of an ice cream. Your answer will accepted if it is within a relative or absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$ of the correct answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 20 3 5 5 0 0 0 0 -10 0 30 0 0 0 0 0 Sample Output: 2
