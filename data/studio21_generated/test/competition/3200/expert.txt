-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$, the length of the road in kilometers ($1 \leq n \leq 16$). Each of the next $n-1$ lines contains $3$ integers $t_ i$, $g_ i$ and $r_ i$, the first time the $i$-th light will switch from red to green after the moment you start driving the car; the green light duration, and the red light duration ($40\leq g_ i,r_ i\leq 50$; $0 \leq t_ i < g_ i+r_ i$). Times are given in seconds. You may assume that any light with $t_ i > r_ i$ is green at the time you start driving the car, and switches to red $t_ i - r_ i$ seconds later. -----Output----- Output the minimum time required to reach the end of the road. Answers within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 Sample Output 1: 44.72135955 Sample Input 2: 2 50 45 45 Sample Output 2: 68.52419365
