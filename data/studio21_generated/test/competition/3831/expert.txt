 You are given an array of integers. You need to find the total width of lawns the Mayor will destroy according to his plan. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — number of parts of the street. Each of the following n lines contains two integers s_{i}, g_{i} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ g_{i} ≤ 10^6) — current width of road and width of the lawn on the i-th part of the street. -----Output----- In the first line print the total width of lawns which will be removed. In the second line print n integers s'_1, s'_2, ..., s'_{n} (s_{i} ≤ s'_{i} ≤ s_{i} + g_{i}) — new widths of the road starting from the first part and to the last. If there is no solution, print the only integer -1 in the first line. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 5 4 5 4 10 Output 16 9 9 10  Input 4 1 100 100 1 1 100 100 1 Output 202 101 101 101 101  Input 3 1 1 100 100 1 1 Output -1
