 You are given an array of integers $a$ and $b$.  The array contains $n$ pairs of integers $(a, b)$.  You need to find the minimum total distance (in meters) that the trees have to be moved. 
-----Input----- The input file starts with a positive even integer $N$ between $4$ and $2000$ (inclusive), giving the total number of trees in the avenue. The next line contains two integers $L$ and $W$, where $1 \le L \le 10000$ is the length of the road, in meters, and $1 \le W \le 20$ is the width of the road, in meters. The next $N$ lines each describe where Tim had dropped of the trees. Each such line contains an integer $0 \le p \le L$ indicating the position of a tree plant along the left side of the road, measured in meters from the start of the road. -----Output----- Output the smallest total number of meters the tree plants need to be moved. The answer should be given with an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 10 1 1 0 10 10 Sample Output: 2.4142135624
