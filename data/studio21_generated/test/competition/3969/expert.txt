 You are given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$. You need to divide them into two disjoint sets. Find the minimal absolute difference between the two sets. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n ≥ m), the number of plants and the number of different species. Each of the following n lines contain two space-separated numbers: one integer number s_{i} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ m), and one real number x_{i} (0 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9), the species and position of the i-th plant. Each x_{i} will contain no more than 6 digits after the decimal point. It is guaranteed that all x_{i} are different; there is at least one plant of each species; the plants are given in order "from left to the right", that is in the ascending order of their x_{i} coordinates (x_{i} < x_{i} + 1, 1 ≤ i < n). -----Output----- Output a single integer — the minimum number of plants to be replanted. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 1 1 2.0 1 3.100 Output 1 Input 3 3 1 5.0 2 5.5 3 6.0 Output 0 Input 6 3 1 14.284235 2 17.921382 1 20.328172 3 20.842331 1 25.790145 1 27.204125 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first test case, Emuskald can replant the first plant to the right of the last plant, so the answer is 1. In the second test case, the species are already in the correct order, so no replanting is needed.
