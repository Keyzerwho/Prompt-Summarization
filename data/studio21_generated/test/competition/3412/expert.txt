 Given map and his infinite amount of luck, what is the fastest time to his date with Daisy 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with two integers $v_{\text {walk}}$ and $v_{\text {bike}}$ ($1\le v_{\text {walk}}< v_{\text {bike}} \le 1000$), the speeds of walking and of biking;  - one line with four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2$ and $y_2$ ($-10^6\le x_1< x_2\le 10^6$; $-10^6\le y_1< y_2\le 10^6$), the bounding coordinates of the map of the center of Duckburg;  - one line with two integers $x_{\text {G}}$ and $y_{\text {G}}$, Gladstone’s position;  - one line with two integers $x_{\text {D}}$ and $y_{\text {D}}$, Daisy’s position;  - one line with one integer $n$ ($0\le n\le 1000$), the number of known bike stations;  - $n$ lines with two integers $x_{\text {station}}$ and $y_{\text {station}}$ each, the coordinates of the known bike stations. All coordinates are on the map of the center, i.e., $x_1\le x\le x_2$ and $y_1\le y\le y_2$. -----Output----- Output one line with the shortest possible time for Gladstone to get to Daisy. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 8 0 0 10 10 5 1 5 9 3 5 8 2 2 9 6 Sample Output: 3.000000000
