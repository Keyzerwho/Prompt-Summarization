 Given coordinates of the flaws, return the smallest diameter drill bit that can be used to remove the flaws.   
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $N$ denoting the number of flaws. $3 \leq N \leq 5000$ This is followed by $N$ lines of input, each containing three real numbers in the range $-1000.0\ldots 1000.0$, denoting the $(x,y,z)$ coordinates of a single flaw. Each number contains at most $6$ digits following a decimal point. The decimal point may be omitted if all succeeding digits are zero. -----Output----- Print the diameter of the smallest drill bit that would remove all the flaws. The answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is less than $10^{-4}$ -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1.0 0.0 1.4 -1.0 0.0 -1.4 0.0 1.0 -0.2 Sample Output 1: 2.0000000000 Sample Input 2: 5 1.4 1.0 0.0 -0.4 -1.0 0.0 -0.1 -0.25 -0.5 -1.2 0.0 0.9 0.2 0.5 0.5 Sample Output 2: 2.0000000000
