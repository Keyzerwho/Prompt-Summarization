 You are given an array of integers. You need to generate two arrays of integers. The first array contains arrival times of all boats. The second array contains the amount of time during which the bridge is unavailable to road traffic. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $N$, the number of boats that must pass the bridge ($1 \leq N \leq 4000$). Then follow $N$ lines, each containing an integer $T_ i$, the time at which boat $i$ will arrive at the bridge in seconds ($60 \leq T_ i \leq 10^5$). Boats are sorted by increasing time of arrival, and never arrive within $20$ seconds of each other ($i < j$ implies $T_ i + 20 \leq T_ j$). -----Output----- Write one line with an integer, the total number of seconds during which the bridge must be unavailable for road traffic in order for all boats to pass the bridge. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 100 200 Sample Output 1: 160 Sample Input 2: 3 100 200 2010 Sample Output 2: 250
