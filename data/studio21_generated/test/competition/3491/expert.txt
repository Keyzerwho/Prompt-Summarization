 You are given a list of floors. Each floor is labeled by some integer. Each floor has green and red button. You need to find a sequence of button presses that will change the staircase room from its current state to the desired state. 
-----Input----- There is a single test case. On the first line $N$ and $M$ are given ($3 \leq N \leq 50$, $0 \leq M \leq N(N-1)/2$). Then follow $M$ lines with pairs of integers $i$, $j$ ($0 \leq i,j\leq N-1$), describing the current state of the room of staircases. Each such line means that there is a staircase connecting floors $i$ and $j$. After this follow another $M$ lines with pairs of integers $i$, $j$, describing the desired state of the room of staircases. You may assume that neither the current state of the room nor the desired state of the room contains two staircases between the same pairs of floors (but some pairs of floors may appear in both the current and desired states of the room). -----Output----- On the first line of output, write a single integer $Q$ ($0 \le Q \le 250000$), the length of your sequence of button presses. Then print $Q$ lines, each being either “R $i$” or “G $i$” for some $i$ ($0 \leq i \leq N-1$), meaning that the red or green button on floor $i$ should be pressed. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 4 0 1 0 3 1 2 2 4 0 2 0 4 2 3 2 4 Sample Output: 2 R 0 G 2
