 Given a sequence of letters, replace each letter with a (base-$10$) digit so that the resulting arithmetic equality holds. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a line containing a single puzzle. A puzzle is a string of characters of the form $w_1$+$w_2$=$w_3$, where $w1$, $w_2$, $w_3$ are words, and ‘+’ and ‘=’ are the usual “plus” and ”equals” characters (ASCII values $43$ and $61$, respectively). A word is a nonempty string of uppercase letters (A–Z). The maximum length of any puzzle is $100$. -----Output----- For each puzzle, output a single line containing the minimal solution if the puzzle is solvable, or “impossible” if the puzzle is not solvable. Note that a solution must contain exactly the same number of characters as the corresponding puzzle, with ‘+’ and ‘=’ characters in the same positions as in the puzzle, and all letters replaced by digits (0–9). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: SEND+MORE=MONEY Sample Output 1: 9567+1085=10652 Sample Input 2: A+A=A Sample Output 2: impossible
