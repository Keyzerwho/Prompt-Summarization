 You are given some program P, and a number N of variables. You need to find the number of memory references and BSR register settings required to run the program. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers $b$ and $s$, where $1 \le b \le 13$ is the number of memory banks and $1 \le s \le 13$ is the number of variables that can be stored in each memory bank. The second line contains a non-empty program with at most $1000$ space-separated elements (each R$n$, V$i$, and E counts as one element). You may assume the following:  - In a repetition R$n$, the number of repetitions satisfies $1 \le n \le 10^6$.  - In a loop operation R$n$ <program> E, the loop body <program> is not empty.  - In a variable reference V$i$, the variable index satisfies $1 \le i \le \min (b \cdot s, 13)$.  - The total number of variable references performed by an execution of the program is at most $10^{12}$. -----Output----- Display the minimum number of instructions that must be executed to complete the program. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 2 V1 V2 V1 V1 V2 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 2 1 V1 V2 V1 V1 V2 Sample Output 2: 6 Sample Input 3: 1 2 R10 V1 V2 V1 E Sample Output 3: 30
