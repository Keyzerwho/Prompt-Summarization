 You are given a list of $n$ distinct points on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Hanh can draw a single loop connecting all these points with some conditions. 
-----Input----- The input starts with an positive integer $t$ – the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow, each has the following format:  - The first line consists of an integer $n$ – the number of points in the list ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$). The sum of $n$ in all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.  - The $i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contains $2$ integers $x_ i$, $y_ i$ describing the $i$-th point ($0 \leq \lvert x_ i \rvert ,\lvert y_ i \rvert \leq 10^9$). It is guaranteed that no two points have the same coordinates. -----Output----- For each test case, if it is possible to draw the loop, print ‘YES’; otherwise, print ‘NO’. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 6 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 3 3 1 3 2 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 Sample Output: YES NO
