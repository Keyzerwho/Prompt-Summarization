 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. The first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 
-----Input----- The fist line of the input is a line consisting of $2$ integers $A$ and $F$ indicating the maximum step length of Elsa and the maximum step length of the father respectively. The step lengths are given as multiples of a tile width.  Then follows a line with $2$ integers $L$ and $W$ indicating the length and width of the map of their possible Lava game.  Then follow $L$ lines each consisting of a string of length $W$, indicating the tiles of the map. Here ‘S’ denotes the start tile, ‘G’ denotes the goal tile, ‘W’ denotes a safe tile and ‘B’ denotes a lava tile. -----Output----- Output a line with the word “SUCCESS” if they both reach the goal at the same time, “GO FOR IT” if Elsa wins and “NO CHANCE” if the father would win. If neither Elsa nor her father is able to reach the goal, output “NO WAY”. -----Limits-----  - $1 \leq A \leq 1000$  - $1 \leq F \leq 1000$  - $1 \leq L \leq 1000$  - $1 \leq W \leq 1000$  - The number of ‘W’ tiles will be at most $1000$.  - The map will only contain the characters ’S’, ’G’, ’W’ and ’B’ and there will only be one ’S’ character and one ’G’ character per map. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 3 4 4 WWWW WSBB WWWW WBWG Sample Output: GO FOR IT
