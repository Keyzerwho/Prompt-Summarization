 You are given $N$ plants numbered $1$ through $N$. The coordinates of a plant are $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. The input consists of two sequences of non-negative integers. The first sequence is a sequence of plants Barica should travel from. The second sequence is a sequence of plants Barica should not travel from. You need to output the sequence of plants Barica should travel from. -----Constraints-----  - 2 N 10^5  - 1 x_i, y_i 10^9  - 1 i < N  - When i   j, (x_i, y_i)   (x_j, y_j)  - x_i and y_i are integers. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $K$ ($2 \le N \le 300000$, $1 \le K \le 1000$) separated by a space. Each of the following $N$ lines contains three integers $X$, $Y$ and $F$ ($0 \le X, Y \le 100000$, $0 \le F \le 1000$) separated by spaces, meaning that there is a plant at coordinates $(X, Y)$ with $F$ flies around it. The first plant in the input is plant $1$, the second is plant $2$ etc. No two plants will share the same pair of coordinates. Note: The input data will guarantee that a sequence of jumps, although not necessarily unique, will always exist. -----Output----- Output the final energy level on the first line. Output an integer $L$, the number of plants Barica should travel, including plants $1$ and $N$. On the following $L$ lines, output the sequence of plants Barica should travel. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 5 1 1 5 2 1 5 1 2 4 2 3 5 3 2 30 3 3 5 Sample Output 1: 5 4 1 1 2 1 2 3 3 3 Sample Input 2: 8 10 1 1 15 2 2 30 1 2 8 2 1 7 3 2 8 2 3 7 4 2 100 3 3 15 Sample Output 2: 36 5 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 3
