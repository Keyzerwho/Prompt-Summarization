 You are given a simple polygon, you need to output the area of the set of points from where you could see all of the walls of your room. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($3\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$), representing the number of vertices of Brandon’s room. Each of the next $n$ lines of input contains two space-separated real numbers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ ($|x_ i|, |y_ i| \le 10^5$), representing the cartesian coordinates of the $i$-th vertex of Brandon’s room. The coordinates have at most two digits after the decimal place. It is guaranteed that the polygon is simple. The vertices may be given in clockwise or counterclockwise order. -----Output----- Output the area of the set of points from where Brandon could see all of the walls of his room. The output will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within $10^{-4}$ of the answer (if $a$ is the output and $b$ is the answer, then $a$ will be considered correct if $\frac{|a-b|}{\max \{ 1,b\} } \le 10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 2 0 1 1 0 2 -2 0 0 -2 Sample Output 1: 8.0000000000 Sample Input 2: 5 0.2 0.00 0 -0.2 0.0 0 -0.2 0 0 0.20 Sample Output 2: 0.0200000000
