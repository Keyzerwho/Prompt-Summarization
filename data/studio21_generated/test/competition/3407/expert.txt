 Given an 2-dimensional board, count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 1000$), the number of connection points. The points are numbered from $1$ to $n$.  - $n-1$ lines, each with two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a,b \le n$), describing a connection between $a$ and $b$. It is guaranteed that these edges describe a valid tree. -----Output----- Output $n$ lines, the $i$th of which contains two real numbers $x_ i,y_ i$, the coordinates of point $i$. To make the production feasible, the following restrictions apply:  - The distance between each pair of points should be at least $10^{-4}$.  - The length of each edge should be $1$, up to an absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$.  - Edges that are not incident to the same vertex should be at least a distance $10^{-6}$ apart.  - The coordinates may not exceed an absolute value of $3000$. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 Sample Output: 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.0000000 0.0000000 -1.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.0000000 0.0000000 -1.0000000
