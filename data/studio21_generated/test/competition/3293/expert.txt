 You are given an m x n grid. The vending machine is located at the top-left corner. Bob wants to make a profit from the machine. He wants to buy some snacks from the machine, and then turn around and sell the snacks he gets for the market price of the snack. This may be different from the vending price. If a cheap snack is at $i$, and an expensive snack is at $f(i)$, he could rake in the cash! Assuming Bob can always find buyers for his snacks, what is the maximum net gain that Bob can obtain by buying some number, possibly zero, of snacks and turning around and selling them later  You may assume that Bob has enough money from other shady activities to cover the cost of buying any number of snacks from the vending machine. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input begins with a line with a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100000$), which is the number of snack positions in the machine. Each of the next $n$ lines contains 4 space-separated integers, $f$ $p$ $m$ $s$, which describe a snack position in the machine, in order from 1 to $n$, where:  - $f$ ($1\le f \le n$) is the value of $f(i)$. That is, it is the position from which the machine will vend when Bob buys from this position  - $p$ ($1\le p \le 1000000$) is the price Bob must pay to buy from this position  - $m$ ($1\le m \le 1000000$) is the market price of the snack at this position  - $s$ ($1\le s \le 1000000$) is the number of snacks at this position -----Output----- Output a single line with a single integer, indicating the maximum profit Sleazy Bob can get from his nefarious abuse of the broken vending machine. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 3 4 5 1 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 3 2 2 3 8 3 1 5 6 1 9 4 7 Sample Output 2: 39
