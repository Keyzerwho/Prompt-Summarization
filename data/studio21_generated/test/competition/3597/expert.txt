 You are given a 3 balls on a line, $x$, $y$ and $z$. You need to find the angle and the distance where the cue ball will hit $1$, $2$ and $3$.
-----Input----- The input begins with a line containing two positive integers $w$ $l$, the width and length of the pool table, where $w, l \leq 120$. The left hole is at location $(0,l)$ and the right hole is at location $(w,l)$. The next line will contain 8 positive integers $r$ $x_1$ $y_1$ $x_2$ $y_2$ $x_3$ $y_3$ $h$, where $r \leq 5$ is the radius of all the balls (including the cue ball), $x_ i$ $y_ i$ is the location of ball $i,1 \leq i \leq 3$, and $h$ is the distance the dashed line is from the front of the pool table (see the figure above, where $r \leq h \leq (1/2)l$). No two balls will ever overlap, though they may touch at a point, and all balls will lie between the dashed line and the back of the table. All balls will lie completely on the table, and the cue ball must also lie completely on the table (otherwise the shot is impossible). -----Output----- For each test case, display the distance $d$ to place the ball on the dashed line and the angle $\theta $ to shoot the ball, or the word “impossible” if the trick shot cannot be done. Output $\theta $ in degrees, and round both $d$ and $\theta $ to the nearest hundredth. Always show two digits after the decimal point, even if the digits are zero. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 20 30 2 10 20 2 24 18 28 10 Sample Output: 12.74 127.83
