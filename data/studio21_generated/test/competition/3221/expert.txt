 You are given N values with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 
-----Input-----  - The first line contains three integers $N$, $M$, $\alpha $, the number of junctions, the number of roads and the predefined constant Mr. G uses to calculate the amount of energy, respectively ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^5$, $1 \leq \alpha \leq 20$).  - In the next $M$ lines, each contains three integers $u$, $v$, $c$ ($1 \leq u \leq N$, $1 \leq v \leq N$, $10^6 \leq c \leq 10^9$), meaning that there is a road connecting two junctions $u$ and $v$, which sells $c$ ginger candies. It is guaranteed that all $c$ in the above $M$ lines are distinct. -----Output----- Write one integer denoting the minimum amount of energy Mr. G has to spend. If there is no route satisfying the condition, output Poor girl instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 7 10 1 2 1000000 2 3 2000000 3 4 3000000 4 5 4000000 5 6 5000000 6 7 6000000 7 1 7000000 Sample Output 1: 49000000000070 Sample Input 2: 6 6 7 1 3 1000000 3 5 3000000 5 1 5000000 2 4 2000000 4 6 4000000 6 2 6000000 Sample Output 2: 25000000000021
