 Given an n dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 
-----Input----- The only line of input contains three space-separated integers $n, k, p$ ($1\le n\le 2000$, $2\le k\le 7$, $10^8<p\le 10^9+9$), where $n$ is the length of the permutations, $k$ is the maximum length of a run, and $p$ is the prime of Brandonâ€™s choice. -----Output----- Output one integer representing the number of permutations of length $n$ that have runs of length at most $k$, modulo $p$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 7 1000000007 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 3 2 1000000007 Sample Output 2: 4
