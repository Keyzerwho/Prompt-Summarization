 Luka parked his truck near the lake. The lake is inhabited by the frog Barica, who jumps across plants floating on the lake s surface. Knowing a fair number of folk tales, Luka knows that if he kisses Barica, she will turn into a beautiful princess. However, he needs to catch her first! Assuming an aerial view, the position of a plant on the lake s surface can be defined with a pair coordinates. From plant $(x, y)$ Barica can jump:  - To plant $(x+P, y+P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $A$.  - To plant $(x+P, y-P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $B$.  - To plant $(x-P, y+P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $C$.  - To plant $(x-P, y-P)$, for any positive integer $P$. Call this direction $D$. Barica selects one of the four directions and
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ $(1 \leq N, K \leq 100000)$, the number of plants and the number of attempted jump. The second line contains $K$ letters each of which is ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ or ‘D’. These letters represent in order the directions in which Barica attempts to jump. Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $X$ and $Y$ $(0 \leq X \leq 1000000000, 0 \leq Y \leq 1000000000$), the coordinates of one plant. Barica is initially located on the first plant. -----Output----- Output Barica’s final coordinates. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 7 5 ACDBB 5 6 8 9 4 13 1 10 7 4 10 9 3 7 Sample Output: 7 4
