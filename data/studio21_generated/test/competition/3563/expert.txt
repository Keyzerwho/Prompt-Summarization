 You are given a list of positions of the holes. You need to find the smallest number of straight lines that can cover the holes.
-----Input----- The only input line starts with $n$, the number of holes. Then $2n$ numbers, the coordinates of the holes, follow. You can assume that $3 \leq n \leq 1000$ and the coordinates are integers between $-1000000$ and $1000000$. The holes lie on the boundary of a convex polygon. -----Output----- The output contains one line with the smallest number $\ell $, such that $\ell $ straight lines can cover the holes. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 Sample Output: 2
