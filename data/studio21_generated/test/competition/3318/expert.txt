 The cat can only mark nodes. The smell will be too overwhelming if two marked nodes are closer than distance $D$. Find the maximum number of nodes the cat can mark. 
-----Input----- First line has two integers, $N$ and $D$. The $0$-th node is the root node of the tree. Then follows $N-1$ lines, the $i$-th of which contain a single integer $x_ i$ with $0 \leq x_ i < i$ (starting with $i = 1$). This means that node $x_ i$ is connected to node $i$. We always have $1 \leq N, D \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- Output should contain one integer: the maximum number of nodes that can be marked. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 0 0 1 Sample Output: 2
