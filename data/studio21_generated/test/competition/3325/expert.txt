 You are given an aquarium tank. You are given the height of the tank in centimetres. You are also given the height of the water in the tank in centimetres. Return the height of the water in the tank. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line contains an integer $N$ ($4 \leq N \leq 100$) giving the number of vertices in the polygon. The next line contains two integers $D$ and $L$, where $1 \le D \le 1000$ is the depth of the aquarium tank and $0 \le L \le 2000$ is the number of litres of water to pour into the tank. The next $N$ lines each contains two integers, giving the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the vertices of the convex polygon in counterclockwise order. The absolute values of $x$ and $y$ are at most $1000$. You may assume that the tank has a positive capacity, and you never pour more water than the tank can hold. -----Output----- Print the height of the water (in centimetres) in the aquarium tank on a line to 2 decimal places. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 30 50 20 0 100 0 100 40 20 40 Sample Output: 20.83
