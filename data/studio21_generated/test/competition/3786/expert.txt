 You are given a tree with n inflorescences numbered from 1 to n. You must return the number of apples Arcady can collect from first inflorescence during one harvest. 
-----Input----- First line of input contains single integer number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000)  — number of inflorescences. Second line of input contains sequence of n - 1 integer numbers p_2, p_3, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} < i), where p_{i} is number of inflorescence into which the apple from i-th inflorescence rolls down. -----Output----- Single line of output should contain one integer number: amount of apples that Arcady will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 Output 1 Input 5 1 2 2 2 Output 3 Input 18 1 1 1 4 4 3 2 2 2 10 8 9 9 9 10 10 4 Output 4 -----Note----- In first example Arcady will be able to collect only one apple, initially situated in 1st inflorescence. In next second apples from 2nd and 3rd inflorescences will roll down and annihilate, and Arcady won't be able to collect them. In the second example Arcady will be able to collect 3 apples. First one is one initially situated in first inflorescence. In a second apple from 2nd inflorescence will roll down to 1st (Arcady will collect it) and apples from 3rd, 4th, 5th inflorescences will roll down to 2nd. Two of them will annihilate and one not annihilated will roll down from 2-nd inflorescence to 1st one in the next second and Arcady will collect it.
