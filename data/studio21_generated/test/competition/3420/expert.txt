 You are given the number of boys in the group and the number of girls in the group. You will also be given the book titles read by each student. Each book that was read was read by exactly one girl and one boy. Students always present books alone, and they can present only the books that they have read. 
-----Input----- The first line consists of two integers $1 \le B,G \le 1000$, the number of boys and girls respectively. Then follow $B$ lines, each starting with the name of the $i$:th boy. Then follows an integer $N_ i$, the number of books that the $i$:th boy has read. Then follow $N_ i$ book titles on the same line. Then follow $G$ lines, each starting with the name of the $i$:th girl. Then follows an integer $N_ i$, the number of books that the $i$-th girl has read. Then follow $N_ i$ book titles on the same line. The book titles and student names consist solely of alphanumeric characters, and they donâ€™t have spaces in them. They both have between $1$ and $20$ characters. Also, no two students will share names. -----Output----- Output should start with a single number $P$, the minimum number of presentations needed. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 2 kenny 1 harrypotter1 charlie 1 lordoftherings jenny 1 harrypotter1 laura 1 lordoftherings Sample Output: 2
