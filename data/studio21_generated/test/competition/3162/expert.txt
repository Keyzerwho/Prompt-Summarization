 given a list of pulses, determine how many pixels will have been activated by the time all pulses have exited the top and right of the grid. 
-----Input----- The first line contains $n$, the number of current pulses, with $1\le n\le 200000$. Following this are $n$ lines, each describing a single pulse. Each such line contains four elements, separated from one another by a single space:  - A single character that is either ‘h’ or ‘v’, indicating the horizontal/vertical direction of the pulse.  - An integer $t$, $1\le t\le 200000$, denoting the starting time of the pulse. The starting time is considered to be the moment when the leading edge of a vertical [horizontal] pulse crosses horizontal [vertical] wire #$1$.  - An integer $m$, $1\le m\le 200000$, denoting the length of the pulse.  - An integer $a$, $1\le a\le 100000$, denoting the wire number (horizontal or vertical) along which the pulse travels. -----Output----- Print on a single line the number of pixels that will have activated by the time the last pulse of current has left the grid. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 h 1 4 1 v 2 4 2 h 10 2 2 v 11 2 3 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 4 h 1 10 1 h 5 10 2 v 1 10 1 v 5 10 3 Sample Output 2: 4
