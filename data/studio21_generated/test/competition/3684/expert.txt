 You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50000$) and $C$ ($1 \le C \le 10^9$). Then follow $n$ lines. The $i$â€™th of these lines contains the three integers $p_ i$, $b_ i$, $u_ i$ with meanings as described above. You may assume that $0 \le p_ i \le b_ i \le 10^9$, and $0 \le u_ i \le 10^9$.Warning This problem has somewhat large amounts of input. We recommend you to make sure that your input is properly buffered in order to make the most of the few seconds of execution time that we give you. -----Output----- Output a single line containing an integer $B$, the maximum possible smallest buffer size after one second. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 20 50 70 10 100 110 4 150 190 16 Sample Output: 5
