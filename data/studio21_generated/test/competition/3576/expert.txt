  You are hiding from police. You have no idea where they are. You pick a random location to hide. You hope that it is not the location police is at. If it is, you get caught. Otherwise, you escape. What is the probability that you will escape  
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains three integers, $R$, $C$ ($1 \leq R, C \leq 10^{11}$) and $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 2\cdot 10^{11}$), the number of rows in the city, the number of columns in the city and the number of blocks the police will search, respectively. -----Output----- It can be shown that the probability of evading capture can be uniquely represented as an irreducible fraction $p/q$. Output a single integer on a line by itself, containing the remainder after dividing $p\cdot q^{-1}$ by $10^{11}+3$, where $q^{-1}$ denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of $q$ with respect to the modulus $10^{11}+3$. The input will be such that $q^{-1}$ always exists. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 4 2 Sample Output: 14500000001
