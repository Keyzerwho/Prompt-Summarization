 You are given a number of problems which were designed for a contest in which the pikeman participated. For each problem, you are given the estimated time in minutes for solving the problem. Calculate the maximum number of problems a pikeman can solve in the contest, and the minimum penalty he can get, under the assumptions that these estimations are correct. You may assume that the pikemen are very efficient: submissions are always correct, and after submitting a problem they start solving the next problem immediately. 
-----Input----- Input starts with two integers on a single line $1 \le N \le 10^9$ and $ 1 \le T \le 10^{18}$, the number of problems in the ancient contest and the total length of the contest in minutes. Then follows a line with four integers $1 \le A, B, C, t_0 \le 10^6$, where $t_0$$(t_0\leq C)$ specifies the time in minutes required for solving the first problem, and the rest of the times $t_1, \dots , t_{N-1}$ are given by:\begin{equation*} t_ i = ((At_{i-1}+B) \text {mod } C) + 1, i \in [1,N-1] \end{equation*} -----Output----- Output should consist of two integers: the maximum number of problems a pikeman can solve within the time limit, and the total penalty he will get for solving them. As the penalty might be huge, print it modulo $1000000007$. Print them on the same line, separated by a single space. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 3 2 2 2 1 Sample Output: 1 1
