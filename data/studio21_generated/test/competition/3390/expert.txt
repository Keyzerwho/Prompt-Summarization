 You are given a list of dishes. For each dish, you have decided which other dishes are fit to be eaten directly after the previous dish. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with two integers $n,m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1\leq m \leq 10^6$), the number of dishes and compatibilities.  - $m$ lines, each containing two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a,b \leq n$), indicating that you can eat dish $b$ immediately after dish $a$. Dishes are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in no particular order, and the compatibilities satisfy the constraint described above. -----Output----- A single integer indicating the maximum number of courses in a menu without repeated dishes. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 1 2 2 3 2 4 Sample Output: 3
