 You are given two numbers $t$ and $r$. You need to return a number $s$ such that $t$ = $s$ and $r$ = $s$. 
-----Input----- The input consists:  - one line with the time that the clock is currently set to.  - one line with the current time. Each time has the format hh:mm, where hh is a two-digit number between 00 and 23, and mm is a two-digit number between 00 and 59. -----Output----- The first line contains the number of different times seen on the clock when setting it correctly. Then for each time output it on the same format as above hh:mm on a separate line. Include both the original time and the final time. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 00:00 01:01 Sample Output 1: 3 00:00 01:00 01:01 Sample Input 2: 00:08 00:00 Sample Output 2: 3 00:08 00:09 00:00
