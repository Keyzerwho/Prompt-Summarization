 You are given an integer sequence. Find any subsequence with the pattern (not necessarily contiguous). Print the indices of the subsequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a non-negative integer $4 \leq N \leq 400000$, giving the number of integers in $S$. Thereafter followÂ $N$ lines, the $i^\textrm {th}$ line contains a single integer $1 \le S_ i \le N$. -----Output----- If $A \not= B$ exists and the pattern $A, B, A, B$ appears as a subsequence of $S$, you should print two integers $A$ and $B$ on a single line separated by a single space, denoting the lexicographically smallest pair of $(A, B)$ as described in the problem statement. Otherwise, if there is no such pair, you should print a single integer $-1$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 8 1 3 2 4 1 5 2 4 Sample Output 1: 1 2 Sample Input 2: 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 Sample Output 2: -1
