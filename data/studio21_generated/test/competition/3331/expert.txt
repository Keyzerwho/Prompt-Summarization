 You are given $n$ cows and $p$ horses. The cows and horses are randomly distributed at positions $A$ and $B$ meters from the left endpoint. The cows and horses move with probabilities $p$ and $q$ respectively. The cows and horses are initially hidden. The cows and horses have walkie-talkies. The cows and horses are initially positioned at positions $A$ and $B$ meters from the left endpoint. The cows and horses move with probabilities $p$ and $q$ respectively.

-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains four integers $1 \le L \le 1000$, $0 \le A \le L$, $0 \le B \le L$, $0 \le P \le L$ separated by spaces, the meanings of which are described in the statement. The numbers $A$, $B$ and $P$ are all distinct. -----Output----- A single integer, the number of minutes before the cows can catch the horse no matter how the horse moves. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 4 3 2 Sample Output: 3
