 You are given two numbers $n$ and $m$. Find the number of natural resources that can exist on El-g -rizm   
-----Input----- The first line contains the positive integers $m$ and $n$, separated by a space, representing the number of islands and the number of different natural resources, respectively. Following that are $m$ lines. The $i$-th such line specifies the natural resources present on the $i$-th island, as a sequence of integers, separated by spaces. The different natural resources are represented by the integers $1, 2, 3, \ldots , n$. The last value on each of the $m$ lines is always $0$. The value $0$ does not represent a natural resource; it only indicates that there are no more subsequent values on that line. You may assume that $m$ and $n$ are each no greater than $1000000$. -----Output----- The output should be a single line consisting of the string YES if the Zax and Xaz can coexist on El-gÄƒ-rizm, or the string NO otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 8 8 0 2 4 0 1 8 0 8 5 0 4 3 7 0 5 2 6 0 1 6 0 7 3 0 Sample Output: YES
