 You are given a $10 \times 10 \times 10$ grid of cubic cells. Each cell is either defective or healthy. You need to find minimum number of square panels required to contain all the defective cells. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each test case will start with a line with a single integer $n$ ($0 \le n \le 1000$) indicating the number of defective cells. Each of the next $n$ lines will hold an $(x,y,z)$ coordinate ($0 \le x,y,z \le 9$) indicating the location in the grid of a defective cell. All of the coordinates in a test case will be unique. -----Output----- Output a single line with a single integer, indicating the minimum number of panels required to contain the defective cells. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 0 0 0 Sample Output 1: 6 Sample Input 2: 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 Sample Output 2: 10
