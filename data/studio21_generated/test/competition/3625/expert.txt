 You are given an array with $n$ integers. Find the maximum possible number, $M$, of integers that can be picked from this array such that no integer is repeated. 
-----Input----- The input contains a single test case. The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 1000$) representing the number of tree species in the forest. Each of the following $N$ lines represents a single tree species population. Each of these population lines contains $4$ integer numbers Y I S B ($0 \le Y \le 1000000$, $0 \le I \le 1000$, $0 \le S \le 1000000$, $0 \le B \le 1000000$). where $S$ is the starting population size, $B$ the year in which the population is planted, $Y$ the number of years during which the population increases each year by $I$ before it decreases by $I$ until it (possibly) dies out. -----Output----- Print the maximum amount of trees that can be harvested in any single year. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 10 10 0 5 Sample Output: 100
