 You are given hexagon with sides $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ cm. You need to count the number of triangles in the hexagon. 
-----Input----- The first and the single line of the input contains 6 space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 and a_6 (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — the lengths of the sides of the hexagons in centimeters in the clockwise order. It is guaranteed that the hexagon with the indicated properties and the exactly such sides exists. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of triangles with the sides of one 1 centimeter, into which the hexagon is split. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 6 Input 1 2 1 2 1 2 Output 13 -----Note----- This is what Gerald's hexagon looks like in the first sample: $\theta$ And that's what it looks like in the second sample: $A$
