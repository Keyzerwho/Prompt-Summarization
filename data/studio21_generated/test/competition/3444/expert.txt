 You are given $N$ integers $k \in [0,N-1]$. Calculate the maximum probability that Luk   gets down the hill without falling, while walking along at most $k$ pistes, and assuming he choses his walking wisely. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $1 \le N \le 300$ and $0 \le M \le \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$, the number of cabins and pistes respectively. Then follow $M$ lines, each describing a piste with three numbers $0 \le a, b < N$ and $0 \le w \le 1$, where $a$ and $b$ are the numbers of the cabins the piste connects, and $w$ is the probability that Lukáš will fall while skiing down the piste. -----Output----- Output should consist of $N$ floating point numbers $p_ k$ ($k \in [0,N-1]$), each denoting the maximum probability that Lukáš didn’t fall when walking along at most $k$ pistes. If it is impossible to get down the hill by walking along at most $k$ pistes, then output $p_ k=-1$. Output them on a single line separated by spaces. Your answer is considered correct if the relative or absolute error is at most $10^{-9}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 0 1 0.5 Sample Output: 0.500000000 1.000000000
