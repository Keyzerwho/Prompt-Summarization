 You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem. 
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains two integers, $L$ and $R$ ($1 \leq L \leq R \leq 10^{200000}$), the inclusive range of house numbers on the street. -----Output----- Output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of houses you will purchase, following your rules. Since this number can be quite large, you should output only the remainder after dividing this number by $10^9+7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 30 70 Sample Output 1: 11 Sample Input 2: 66 69 Sample Output 2: 2
