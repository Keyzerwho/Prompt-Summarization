 You are given four integers a_00, a_01, a_10, a_11. Find any non-empty string s that matches them, or determine that there is no such string. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains four non-negative integers a_00, a_01, a_10 and a_11. Each of them doesn't exceed 10^9. -----Output----- If there exists a non-empty string that matches four integers from the input, print it in the only line of the output. Otherwise, print "Impossible". The length of your answer must not exceed 1 000 000. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 3 4 Output Impossible Input 1 2 2 1 Output 0110
