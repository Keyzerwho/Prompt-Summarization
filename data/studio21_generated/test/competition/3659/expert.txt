 Given a number of books, design a bookcase that can hold all of them. 
-----Input----- The input begins with a line containing a single positive integer $N$, $3\leq N\leq 70$ giving the number of books. Then $N$ lines follow each containing two positive integers $h_ i$, $t_ i$, satisfying $150\leq h_ i \leq 300$ and $5\leq t_ i \leq 30$, the height and thickness of book $i$ respectively, in millimeters. -----Output----- Output one line containing the minimum area (height times width) of a three-shelf bookcase capable of holding all the books, expressed in square millimeters. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 220 29 195 20 200 9 180 30 Sample Output: 18000
