 You are given a number a. You need to rearrange its digits so that the resulting number will be divisible by 7. 
-----Input----- The first line contains positive integer a in the decimal record. It is guaranteed that the record of number a contains digits: 1, 6, 8, 9. Number a doesn't contain any leading zeroes. The decimal representation of number a contains at least 4 and at most 10^6 characters. -----Output----- Print a number in the decimal notation without leading zeroes â€” the result of the permutation. If it is impossible to rearrange the digits of the number a in the required manner, print 0. -----Examples----- Input 1689 Output 1869 Input 18906 Output 18690
