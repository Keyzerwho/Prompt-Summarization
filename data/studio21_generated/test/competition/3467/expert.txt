 You are a very busy person. You have an important meeting. You live in Z rich. You have a tram. The tram arrives every $t$ seconds. You have a meeting. The meeting starts at $t$. You need to arrive at the meeting on time. You need to leave for your hotel. When do you need to leave for your hotel? 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with three integers $n$, $m$ and $s$ ($2 \le n \leq 100000$, $1 \le m \leq 200000$, $1 \le s \leq 10^9$), the number of tram stops, the number of tram lines, and the time at which the meeting starts in seconds relative to now.  - $m$ lines, each with five integers $u, v, t_0, p, d$ ($0 \le u \not= v < n$, $0 \le t_0 \le 10^9$, $1 \le p, d \le 10^9$). The $i$’th line describes the $i$’th tram line, which departs from tram stop $u$, arrives at tram stop $v$, starts its first departure $t_0$ seconds from now, departs every $p$ seconds from the first departure, and takes $d$ seconds from departure to arrival. The stops are numbered between $0$ and $n - 1$. Your hotel is located at stop $0$, and the meeting is at stop $n - 1$. -----Output----- Output the latest time at which you can leave the hotel while arriving to your meeting on time, in seconds from now. If you can not make it to your meeting on time, output impossible instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 10 0 1 1 2 6 Sample Output: 3
