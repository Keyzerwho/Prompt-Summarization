 You are given an $n\times n$ grid. The grid is surrounded with $1$s. You need to determine which of the $4n+4$ surrounding $1$s are guaranteed to not contain a mine. 
-----Input----- An integer $n$ with $1 \leq n \leq 1000$, the side length of the square. The image corresponds to $n = 6$. It can be shown that there exists at least one valid placement of mines for each $n$. -----Output----- First print the number $m$ of safe cells. Then print a line with $m$ integers, the indices of the safe cells in increasing order. The cells are indexed clockwise from $1$ to $4n+4$, starting at the bottom left corner, as shown in the image. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 Sample Output: 8 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15
