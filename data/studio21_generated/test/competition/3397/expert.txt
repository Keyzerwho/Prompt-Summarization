 You are given N dogs which need to be fed. Each dog has his own food bowl. Each food bowl has capacity of 1. Each dog can eat food from his bowl. You need to find minimum number of bowls required to feed all dogs.
-----Input----- The first line contains integers $N$ and $M$, where $2\leq N\leq M\leq 50$. Each of the next $N$ lines of the input contains $M$ integers each. The $j^\textrm {th}$ integers on the $i^\textrm {th}$ line denotes the $t_{ij}$, the amount of time that the $i^\textrm {th}$ dog will spend on eating food from the $j^\textrm {th}$ bowl. Note that $1\leq t_{ij}\leq 200$. -----Output----- Output $T$, the minimum total waiting time in seconds. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 3 2 100 10 100 1 10 Sample Output: 0
