 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $k$. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum number of ways you may write the numbers on the houses' plaques so as to fulfill the three above described conditions. Print the remainder after dividing this number by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). 
-----Input----- The single line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(8, n)) — the number of the houses and the number k from the statement. -----Output----- In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 5 2 Output 54 Input 7 4 Output 1728
