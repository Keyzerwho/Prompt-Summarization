 You are given n integers. Make sets of the integers such that:  each integer is at most in one set;  each set contains at least 1 integer;  each set contains at most n integers. Return the number of such sets that can be formed. 
-----Input----- The first line contains five integers n, a, b, k, f (1 ≤ n ≤ 300, 1 ≤ b < a ≤ 100, 0 ≤ k ≤ 300, 1 ≤ f ≤ 1000) where:  n — the number of Polycarp trips,  a — the cost of a regualar single trip,  b — the cost of a trip after a transshipment,  k — the maximum number of travel cards Polycarp can buy,  f — the cost of a single travel card.  The following n lines describe the trips in the chronological order. Each line contains exactly two different words separated by a single space — the name of the start stop and the name of the finish stop of the trip. All names consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters and have lengths between 1 to 20 letters inclusive. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be considered different. -----Output----- Print the smallest amount of money Polycarp could have spent today, if he can purchase no more than k travel cards. -----Examples----- Input 3 5 3 1 8 BerBank University University BerMall University BerBank Output 11 Input 4 2 1 300 1000 a A A aa aa AA AA a Output 5 -----Note----- In the first example Polycarp can buy travel card for the route "BerBank $\leftrightarrow$ University" and spend 8 burles. Note that his second trip "University" $\rightarrow$ "BerMall" was made after transshipment, so for this trip Polycarp payed 3 burles. So the minimum total sum equals to 8 + 3 = 11 burles. In the second example it doesn't make sense to buy travel cards. Note that each of Polycarp trip (except the first) was made with transshipment. So the minimum total sum equals to 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 burles.
