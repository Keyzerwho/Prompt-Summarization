  You are given numbers m and n. You are given an array of strings consisting of only 0's and 1's. Return the maximum number of strings that can be formed by using less than (m+1) 0's and (n+1) 1's in total. 
-----Input----- A single line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n,m \leq 10^9$) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the chessboard. -----Output----- Print one integer — the maximum number of chessmen Little C can place. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 Output 0 Input 3 3 Output 8 -----Note----- In the first example, the Manhattan distance between any two cells is smaller than $3$, so the answer is $0$. In the second example, a possible solution is $(1,1)(3,2)$, $(1,2)(3,3)$, $(2,1)(1,3)$, $(3,1)(2,3)$.
