 You are given a description for Zara s skyline (a list of buildings, each with a target height $b$). Pippa must then stack her blocks such that the sum of the heights of the blocks in each stack corresponds to the height of the building in the skyline.
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line of this test case contains two integers $N$ and $S$ ($1 \le N \le 15$ and $1 \le S \le 15$), where $N$ is the number of blocks Pippa has and $S$ is the number of buildings in the skyline Zara made. The next line contains $N$ integers ($1 \le h_ i \le 10^{9}$) representing the heights of each of the blocks. The last line contains $S$ integers ($1 \le b_ i \le 10^{9}$) representing the heights of each of the buildings. -----Output----- If it is possible for Pippa to build Zaraâ€™s skyline then output $S$ lines. On each line output a single number $s_ i$ representing the number of blocks needed to build building $i$ where $i$ corresponds to the $i^{\text {th}}$ building listed in the input. This should be followed (on the same line) by $s_ i$ numbers $j$ representing the blocks of the input used in building $i$, where $j$ represents the $j^{\text {th}}$ block appearing the input. If no combination of the blocks can build the desired skyline then output -1. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 3 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 Sample Output 1: 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 Sample Input 2: 4 2 3 3 2 2 6 3 Sample Output 2: -1
