 You are given $n$ gold stores. For each store, you are given its altitude above sea level. The altitude determines when the store will be swallowed by the rising sea. The gold stores are ordered in non-decreasing order of their altitudes. For each store, you are given its altitude above sea level. The altitude determines when the store will be swallowed by the rising sea. The gold stores are ordered in non-decreasing order of their altitudes.

-----Input----- The first line of input will contain the integer $n$, ($1 \leq n \leq 200000$), the number of gold stores in Atlantis. The next $n$ lines will contain two integers on each line, $t_ i$ and $h_ i$, ($1 \leq t_ i, h_ i \leq 10^9$), the round-trip time in seconds it will take Demetrios to visit store $i$ and return to his ship with the gold, and the feet above sea level of store $i$, respectively. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of gold stores Demetrios can visit such that each is visited prior to it becoming submerged. Assume sea level rises by one foot every second, starts at height $0$, and begins rising immediately. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 5 8 5 6 3 4 5 13 6 10 Sample Output: 3
