 You are given a connected graph. You are given a string s. You are required to check whether there exists a string s such that if Vasya used this s he would produce the given graph. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and m $(1 \leq n \leq 500,0 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n - 1)}{2})$ — the number of vertices and edges in the graph found by Petya, respectively. Each of the next m lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 ≤ u_{i}, v_{i} ≤ n, u_{i} ≠ v_{i}) — the edges of the graph G. It is guaranteed, that there are no multiple edges, that is any pair of vertexes appear in this list no more than once. -----Output----- In the first line print "Yes" (without the quotes), if the string s Petya is interested in really exists and "No" (without the quotes) otherwise. If the string s exists, then print it on the second line of the output. The length of s must be exactly n, it must consist of only letters "a", "b" and "c" only, and the graph built using this string must coincide with G. If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 1 2 Output Yes aa Input 4 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output No -----Note----- In the first sample you are given a graph made of two vertices with an edge between them. So, these vertices can correspond to both the same and adjacent letters. Any of the following strings "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb", "bc", "cb", "cc" meets the graph's conditions.  In the second sample the first vertex is connected to all three other vertices, but these three vertices are not connected with each other. That means that they must correspond to distinct letters that are not adjacent, but that is impossible as there are only two such letters: a and c.
