 Create a function `summary` that accepts an array of arrays of integers, where each inner array represents the weight of a figurine, and returns an array of integers, where each inner array represents the weight of a $4$-pack. For an optimal solution, the following operation should complete within 6000ms
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$, the number of different figurines to be produced, where $1\leq N\leq 40000$. The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the weight in grams of each of the figurines. Each weight, $k$, is an integer satisfying $1\leq k\leq 60000$, and all $N$ weights are distinct. -----Output----- The output should consist of a single line with $4$ space-separated values. The first value should be an integer, the maximum weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines. The second value should be an integer, the minimum weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines. The third value should be an integer, the number of distinct weights that the $4$-packs can have for the given set of figurines. The fourth value should be a floating-point value, the expected weight of a $4$-pack in grams for the given set of figurines, with an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-4}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1 2 4 7 Sample Output: 28 4 21 14.0
