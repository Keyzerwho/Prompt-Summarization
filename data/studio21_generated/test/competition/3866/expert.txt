 You are given an integer n (> 0). Find all permutations of length n such that 
1) each permutation has exactly 1 element
2) each permutation has exactly 2 elements
3) each permutation has exactly 3 elements
4) each permutation has exactly 4 elements
5) each permutation has exactly 5 elements
6) each permutation has exactly 6 elements
7) each permutation has exactly 7 elements
8) each permutation has exactly 8 elements
9) each permutation has exactly 9 elements
10) each permutation has exactly 10 elements
11) each permutation has exactly 11 elements
12) each permutation has exactly 12 elements
13) each permutation has exactly 13 elements
14) each permutation has exactly 14 elements
15) each permutation has exactly 15 elements
16) each permutation has exactly 16 elements

-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- If no Lucky Permutation Triple of length n exists print -1. Otherwise, you need to print three lines. Each line contains n space-seperated integers. The first line must contain permutation a, the second line — permutation b, the third — permutation c. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 Output 1 4 3 2 0 1 0 2 4 3 2 4 0 1 3 Input 2 Output -1 -----Note----- In Sample 1, the permutation triple ([1, 4, 3, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2, 4, 3], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]) is Lucky Permutation Triple, as following holds:  $1 + 1 \equiv 2 \equiv 2 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $4 + 0 \equiv 4 \equiv 4 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $3 + 2 \equiv 0 \equiv 0 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $2 + 4 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \operatorname{mod} 5$;  $0 + 3 \equiv 3 \equiv 3 \operatorname{mod} 5$.  In Sample 2, you can easily notice that no lucky permutation triple exists.
