 You are given $N$ points. Two players will play the following game:   Player 1 marks $4$ points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$.   Player 2 marks $4$ points $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, $D'$.   Player 1 joins the two points to form $4$-gons.   Player 2 joins the two points to form $4$-gons.   The area of $4$-gons is added to player 1's score.   The area of $4$-gons is added to player 2's score.   The turn changes.   A player can not draw a $4$-gon if it was drawn before.   You can use previously used points. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a positive integer $N$ ($N \leq 700$). Hence follows $N$ coordinates of the points $(x, y)$. In case you don’t know, I should say—I am not from your time, I was brought here by a few scientists from future. And in my time we use huge boards so the absolute value of the coordinates can be as large as $10^6$. Just to ensure that no one can draw a degenerate quadrilateral, no three points will be collinear. -----Output----- Output the sum of the scores. Since this score can be huge just print the answer modulo $1000003$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 2 0 0 2 -2 0 0 -2 Sample Output: 16
