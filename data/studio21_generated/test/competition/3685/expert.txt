-----Input-----  - One line consisting of two positive integers $r$ $c$ ($1 < r, c \leq 60$), the size of the school in rows and columns.  - One line consisting of two pairs of bracketed positive integers, the row and column coordinates of the starting bed in the dormitory and the fridge in the kitchen respectively.  - Another $r$ lines, each containing a string of $c$ characters with the following meaning:  - ‘.’: Walkable area  - ‘#’: Blocked area  - One line consisting of a single integer $p$ ($1 \le p \le 200$) representing the number of patrolling masters.  - Another $p$ lines, each a size-prefixed list of between $1$ and $7$ space-separated bracketed $(r, c)$ coordinates representing a contiguous path for the master to patrol. All ‘special’ coordinates (locations of the bed, fridge, and masters) will be marked as walkable on the map. -----Output----- On a single line print the minimum number of turns for the child to reach the jelly. If the child cannot reach the jelly, output IMPOSSIBLE. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 5 (2 5) (5 3) ..... .#.#. .#.#. ....# .#.## 1 6 (4 2) (4 3) (3 3) (2 3) (1 3) (1 2) Sample Output: 26
