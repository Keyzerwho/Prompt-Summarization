 You are given a list of available airfares, find the least amount of money Ivan needs to spend on tickets to be able to complete his journey. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $d$ ($2 \le n, d \le 300000$) – the number of cities in Europe and the number of concerts. The following line contains integers $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ d$ ($1 \le ai \le n, ai \not= a_{i+1}, a_1 = a_ d$) – the planned tour schedule. The following line contains an integer $m$ ($3 \le m \le 300000$) – the number of airfares. The $k$-th of the following $m$ lines contains four tokens $s_ k$, $d_ k$, $t_ k$, $p_ k$, describing the $k$-th airfare as follows:  - $s_ k$ and $d_ k$ ($1 \le s_ k, d_ k \le n, s_ k \not= d_ k$) are the origin and the destination city respectively,  - $t_ k$ is an uppercase letter “O” or “R” denoting a one-way or round trip ticket respectively,  - $p_ k$ ($1 \le pk \le 10^9$) is the ticket price, an integer. -----Output----- Output the least amount of money necessary to purchase tickets that allow Ivan to complete the planned tour. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 5 1 2 1 2 1 4 1 2 R 6 1 2 O 3 2 1 O 3 1 2 R 5 Sample Output: 10
