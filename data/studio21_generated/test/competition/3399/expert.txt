 In Gridnavia, three languages are spoken: Arwegian, Banish, and Cwedish. Gridnavia consists of an $n \times m$ grid, where at least one language is spoken in each cell. It is known that each of the three languages is spoken in a non-empty connected subset of grid cells. Connected means that it is possible to get between any pair of cells by moving through adjacent cells, where two cells are said to be adjacent if they share a side.  You have made a survey to find where in Gridnavia each language is spoken. The following question was sent to every cell in the region:  Please indicate if one or several of the languages is spoken in your cell . But due to a misprint, there were no choices after the question, so everyone just wrote  one  or  several . So the only thing you know is for each cell whether exactly one, or more than one language is spoken in that cell. To make the best out of the situation, you should find any division of the three languages that corresponds to the information.
