 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the length of the shortest dog chain in whole meters he can buy so that the dog is able to cover an area of at least $L$ square meters. 
-----Input----- The first line has one integer $L$ indicating the number of square meters for Ellenâ€™s lawn. The second line contains two integers $x_1$ and $y_1$, followed by a third line containing two integers $x_2$ and $y_2$. These indicate that the wall passes through the points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$. -----Output----- Output the chain length, in whole meters, which Tom needs to acquire. -----Limits-----  - $1 \leq L \leq 10000$  - $-10000 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 10000$  - $(x_1,y_1) \not= (x_2,y_2)$ -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 -10 0 -10 10 Sample Output: 2
