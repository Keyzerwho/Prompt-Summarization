 Yes, we know $\ldots $ we ve used Challenge $24$ before for contest problems. In case you ve never heard of Challenge $24$ (or have a very short memory) the object of the game is to take $4$ given numbers (the base values) and determine if there is a way to produce the value $24$ from them using the four basic arithmetic operations (and parentheses if needed). For example, given the four base values 3 5 5 2, you can produce $24$ in many ways. Two of them are: 5*5-3+2 and (3+5)*(5-2). Recall that multiplication and division have precedence over addition and subtraction, and that equal-precedence operators are evaluated left-to-right. This is all very familiar to most of you, but what you probably don t know is that you can grade the quality of the expressions used to produce $24$. In fact, we re sure you don t know this since we ve just made it up. Here s how it works: A perfect grade for an expression is $0$. Each use of parentheses adds one point to the grade. Furthermore, each inversion (
-----Input----- Input consists of a single line containing $4$ base values. All base values are between $1$ and $100$, inclusive. -----Output----- Display the lowest grade possible using the sequence of base values. If it is not possible to produce $24$, display impossible. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 5 5 2 Sample Output: 1
