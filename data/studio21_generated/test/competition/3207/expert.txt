 You are given the initial positions, colors and directions of movement of all the chameleons, for each color determine the total trip taken by the chameleons in that color before getting off the stick. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integers $N$, $K$ and $L$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100000$, $1 \leq K \leq 40$, $1 \leq L \leq 1000000$) from the task. The $i$-th of the following $N$ lines contains the integer $d_ i$ ($0 \leq d_ i \leq L$) that denotes the distance between the $i$-th chameleon and the left end of the stick, then the integer $b_ i$ ($0 \leq b_ i \leq K - 1$) that denotes the color of the $i$-th chameleon and the character ‘L’ (left) or ‘D’ (right) that denote the direction of movement of the $i$-th chameleon. All integers $d_ i$ will be unique and given in strictly ascending order. -----Output----- The output must contain $K$ lines, the $i$-th line containing the total trip taken by the chameleons in color $i$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 3 10 0 0 D 10 1 L Sample Output 1: 10.0 10.0 0.0 Sample Input 2: 4 3 7 1 0 D 3 0 D 4 1 L 6 2 D Sample Output 2: 10.0 4.0 1.0
