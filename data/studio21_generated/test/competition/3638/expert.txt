 Let's assume your rival has a 2/3 chance of winning each round, and that the probability of him choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors is 1/3 each. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1\leq n \leq 10^6$), the number of rounds in the final match, and $s$ ($1 \leq s \leq 10$), the number of sequences. The remaining $s$ lines each describe a prediction, consisting of a string of characters ‘R’, ‘P’, and ‘S’. All predictions have the same length, which is between $1$ and $n$ characters long, inclusive, and no longer than $10^5$. -----Output----- Display all of the predictions, sorted by decreasing likelihood of appearance sometime during the final match. In the case of tied predictions, display them in the same order as in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 4 PP RR PS SS Sample Output: PS PP RR SS
