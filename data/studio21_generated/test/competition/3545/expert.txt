 You are given three procedures, prePrint, inPrint, and postPrint, that print a tree. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of three strings on three separate lines: the observed output of Anatoly’s prePrint, inPrint and postPrint routines (in that order) on some test tree. Each of these strings consists of $n$ uppercase letters ($4 \le n \le 26$), with no repeated letters in any string. The test case is guaranteed to have at least one solution. -----Output----- Display all possible reconstructions for the test case, ordered as described in the last paragraph below. The output for each reconstruction consists of two parts. The first part is a single line and describes the six calls in Anatoly’s routines: first the two (recursive) calls in Anatoly’s prePrint routine, followed by the calls in his inPrint routine, and finally the calls in his postPrint routine. The calls are described by the words Pre, In, and Post, separated by spaces. For example, if Anatoly’s routines were correct, the resulting output of the first part of the reconstruction would be Pre Pre In In Post Post. The second part consists of three lines and describes the first test tree that could have generated the observed outputs. The first line is the correct preorder print of the tree, and the second and third lines contain the correct inorder and postorder prints, respectively. The first tree is the one with the alphabetically first preorder print. If there are multiple such trees, the first of these is the one with the alphabetically first inorder print. Every reconstruction is a sequence of 6 tokens chosen from Pre, In, and Post. The ordering of reconstructions is lexicographic with respect to the following ordering of tokens: Pre < In < Post. -----Examples----- Sample Input: HFBIGEDCJA BIGEDCJFAH BIGEDCJFAH Sample Output: Pre Post In Post In Pre HFBJCDEGIA BIGEDCJFAH IGEDCJBAFH
