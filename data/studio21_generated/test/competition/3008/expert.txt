 You are given $N$ different home assistants and you want to rank them. Each assistant has two different qualities. You want to create maximum number of different rankings. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integers $1 \le N \le 100000$ and $0 \le K \le 10^9$ â€“ the number of assistants and the measurement difference limit as described in the statement. The next line contains the $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ N$. The next line contains the $N$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots , b_ N$. All measurements are between $0$ and $10^9$. -----Output----- Output a single integer: the maximum number of distinct ranks. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 10 1 12 1 13 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 2 10 1 5 1 12 Sample Output 2: 2 Sample Input 3: 2 10 1 5 1 4 Sample Output 3: 2 Sample Input 4: 2 10 1 5 4 1 Sample Output 4: 2
