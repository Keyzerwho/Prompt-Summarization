 You are given an $r\! \times \! c$ grid. Each cell of this grid is filled with a number between $1$ and $r{\cdot }c$ inclusive, and each cell s number is distinct. Define a grid of numbers to be monotonic if each row and column is either increasing or decreasing (this can be different for each row or column). Define a subgrid of the grid as follows: First choose some nonempty subset of the rows and columns. Next, take elements that lie in both the chosen rows and columns in the same order. There are $(2^r{-}1)(2^c{-}1)$ nonempty subgrids of the given grid. Of these subgrids, count how many are monotonic. Consider this grid: 
-----Input----- Each test case will begin with a line with two space-separated integers $r$ and $c$ ($1\! \le \! r,c\! \le \! 20$), which are the dimensions of the grid. Each of the next $r$ lines will contain $c$ space-separated integers $x$ ($1\! \le \! x\! \le \! r{\cdot }c$, all $x$â€™s are unique). This is the grid. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the number of monotonic subgrids in the given grid. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 1 2 5 7 6 4 9 8 3 Sample Output: 49
