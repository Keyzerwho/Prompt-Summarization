 You are given a sequence $S = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, N \}$ of numbers. For each number $i$, print $i$ and the sum of all numbers with labels smaller than $i$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the positive integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 1500$), the number of cities. Each of the following $N$ lines contains $N$ positive integers from the interval $[0,1000]$. The number in $B$-th place in the $A$-th row represents the flight duration between cities $A$ and $B$; that number is equal to the $A$-th number in the $B$-th row. When $A = B$, that number is 0. Otherwise, it is a positive value. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the required minimum total flight duration. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 0 5 2 5 0 4 2 4 0 Sample Output: 7
