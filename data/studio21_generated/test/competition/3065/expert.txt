 You are given a map $M$ of a spaceship. The captain will be beamed down to the first room of the walk, and will be beamed back up from the last room. He risks capture in both these rooms. Now the captain starts wondering about the chances of success on this mission, hoping them to be very low indeed. After all, that makes it all the more interesting! Getting curious yourself, you decide you want to figure this out. Unfortunately the ship s android is experiencing problems with his new emotion chip, and thus the task falls on you to compute the captain s chances of success on this dangerous mission! 
-----Input----- One line with $2 \leq N \leq 500$ – the number of nodes. One line with $1 \leq L \leq 500$ – the number of rooms the captain must visit. One line with $L$ integers describing the captain’s walk, i.e., they give the exact walk the captain must perform. $N$ lines beginning with an integer $n_ i$ – the number of neighbours of node $i$ – followed by $n_ i$ integers – the neighbours of node $i$, $0$-indexed. -----Output----- The chance the captain will be able to complete his mission without being discovered by the Borg sentry. The answer should be correct within an absolute or relative error of $10^{-6}$ -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 0 2 1 2 1 0 1 0 Sample Output 1: 0.5 Sample Input 2: 8 6 1 0 2 3 0 1 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 0 2 0 3 2 0 2 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 Sample Output 2: 0.0446429
