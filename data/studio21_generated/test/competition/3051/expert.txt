 You are given the description of the $n$ originator fogs. You need to count the total number of fogs that are missed. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a positive integer $n$ $(n \leq 1000)$, the number of originator fogs. This is followed by $n$ lines, the $i$-th of which contains the parameters of $F_ i$ as eight space-separated integers in this order:${m_ i}$ – the number of fogs generated by $F_ i$${d_ i}$ – the day $F_ i$ appears for the first time${\ell _ i}$ – the leftmost $x$-coordinate of $F_ i$${r_ i}$ – the rightmost $x$-coordinate of $F_ i$${h_ i}$ – the height of $F_ i$$\Delta d_ i$ – the number of days between consecutive fogs generated by $F_ i$$\Delta x_ i$ – the distance to which each subsequent fog generated by $F_ i$ shifts to the right (if $\Delta x_ i$ is negative, the shift is to the left)$\Delta h_ i$ – the change in height of each subsequent fog generated by $F_ i$ You can assume that  - $1 \leq m_ i \leq 100$  - $0 \leq d_ i \leq 10^8$  - $-10^8 \leq \ell _ i < r_ i \leq 10^8$  - $1 \leq h_ i \leq 10^8$  - $1 \leq \Delta d_ i \leq 10^6$  - $-10^6 \leq \Delta x_ i, \Delta h_ i \leq 10^6$  - $h_ i + (m_ i-1)\Delta h_ i \geq 1$ -----Output----- Output a single integer, the total number of fogs that are missed. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 2 3 0 2 9 2 3 0 1 6 1 4 6 3 -1 -2 Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 3 4 0 0 10 10 1 15 0 3 5 50 55 8 1 -16 2 3 10 7 10 4 1 8 -1 Sample Output 2: 6 Sample Input 3: 2 7 0 0 20 10 3 0 10 10 1 0 2 5 2 2 7 Sample Output 3: 11
