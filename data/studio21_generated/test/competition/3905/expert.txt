-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers n, m and h (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ h ≤ 100 000), the number of company data centers, number of clients and the day length of day measured in hours.  The second line of input contains n integers u_1, u_2, ..., u_{n} (0 ≤ u_{j} < h), j-th of these numbers is an index of a maintenance hour for data center j.  Each of the next m lines contains two integers c_{i}, 1 and c_{i}, 2 (1 ≤ c_{i}, 1, c_{i}, 2 ≤ n, c_{i}, 1 ≠ c_{i}, 2), defining the data center indices containing the data of client i. It is guaranteed that the given maintenance schedule allows each client to access at least one copy of his data at any moment of day. -----Output----- In the first line print the minimum possible number of data centers k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data available for any client. In the second line print k distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n), the indices of data centers whose maintenance time will be shifted by one hour later. Data center indices may be printed in any order. If there are several possible answers, it is allowed to print any of them. It is guaranteed that at there is at least one valid choice of data centers. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 5 4 4 0 1 3 3 2 3 1 Output 1 3  Input 4 5 4 2 1 0 3 4 3 3 2 1 2 1 4 1 3 Output 4 1 2 3 4  -----Note----- Consider the first sample test. The given answer is the only way to conduct an experiment involving the only data center. In such a scenario the third data center has a maintenance during the hour 1, and no two data centers storing the information of the same client have maintenance at the same hour. On the other hand, for example, if we shift the maintenance time on hour later for the first data center, then the data of clients 1 and 3 will be unavailable during the hour 0.
