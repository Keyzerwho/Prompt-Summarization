 You are given $N$ and $M$. $N$ is the number of Zerglings and $M$ is the number of opponent Zerglings. You are given a map $M \times N$. Each square on the map represents a grid square. Each Zergling occupies a grid square and no two Zerglings ever occupy the same grid square. Each Zergling has a certain number of hit points which starts off as $35$. Its attack value is $5$ plus the attack upgrade of the player that controls it. When one Zergling attacks another, the damage incurred equals to the attack value of the attacking Zergling minus the armour upgrade of the player that owns the Zergling being attacked. The number of hit points of the Zergling that is attacked is reduced by the amount of the damage. Due to the inability of both players to manage their huge horde of Zerglings, the Zerglings make their decisions each turn using the following algorithm (Zerglings are not the brightest creatures, as you will see):  - If there is an opponent Zergling in one of the $8$ horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent grid squares, the Zergling will attack it. A Zergling attacks at most one opponent each turn; see below for the tie-breaking rules
-----Input----- The input begins with $N$ between $2$ and $150$, followed by $2$ pairs of $2$ integers between $0$ and $3$, the attack and armour upgrades of the first player, followed by the attack and armour upgrades of the second player. This is followed by the initial game map, where ’.’ denotes an empty square, ’1’ a Zergling belonging to the first player and ’2’ a Zergling belonging to the second player. On the map, north is up (i.e., towards the first row) and west is left (i.e., towards the first column). Finally, the input provides the number $t$ of turns for which the Zerg rush is to be simulated, which is an integer between $0$ and $400$, inclusive. -----Output----- Output the map after $t$ turns in the same format as above. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 0 0 0 0 1. .. 0 Sample Output: 1. ..
