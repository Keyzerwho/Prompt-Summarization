 You are given $n$ and $m$. You need to calculate how much smoothie (in ml) Three-Headed Monkey can bring to her family (given $n$ and $m$). 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains three integers $D, W, C$ â€“ the distance between the monkey and her family in meters, the total amount of smoothie in ml and finally her maximum carrying capacity in ml. All integers are positive and at most $1000000$. -----Output----- Output one line with one number, the amount of smoothie in ml that the Three-Headed Monkey is able to bring to her family. Output will be considered correct if it is within relative or absolute error $10^{-7}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1000 3000 1000 Sample Output: 533.3333333333
