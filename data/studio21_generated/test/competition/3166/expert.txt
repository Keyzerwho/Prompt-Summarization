 Your task is to find the smallest possible set $S$ of $k$ players to disqualify. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two positive integers, $n$ the number of high school students, and $k$ the number of disqualified players. Then follows $n$ lines, each containing $n$ integers. The $j$-th integer on the $i$-th line is $1$ if player $i$ beat player $j$, and $0$ otherwise (i.e. there is also a $0$ at the $i$-th entry of the $i$-th line, even though player $i$ didn’t lose to himself). Finally, there is a line with $k$ integers indicating the set $S$, the players who were disqualified. Each player is identified by a number between $0$ and $n-1$. You may assume that, when the disqualified players $S$ are removed, there exists a fair ranking of the remaining players. A fair ranking is one such that nobody is ranked below someone they beat. We remark that even though the Swedish experts couldn’t find a fair ordering of all the players, there might still be one. Note: The input may be quite large. We always have $2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2000$. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the size $k’$ of the smallest set $S’$ of players needed to be disqualified to make a fair ranking. Recall that none of the originally disqualified players of $S$ can be in $S’$, and $k’$ must be strictly less than $k$. If no such solution exists, print “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 4 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 2 Sample Output 2: impossible
