 You are given 2 cards, each containing 25 numbers. You have to determine, if after calling 25 numbers, there is a tie between 2 players. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input is an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$), the number of bingo cards. After the first line are the $n$ bingo cards, each separated from the next by a blank line of input. Each bingo card consists of five lines of input. Each line consists of five integers in the range from $1$ to $3000$. The numbers on each bingo card are unique. -----Output----- If no ties are possible between any two cards, output “no ties”. Otherwise, output the two numbers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a < b \le n$) identifying the two cards for which a tie could occur, where the cards are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in the order that they appear in the input. If multiple pairs of cards can tie, output the pair with the smallest $a$, breaking any remaining ties with the smallest $b$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 3 29 45 56 68 1 19 43 50 72 11 25 40 49 61 9 23 31 58 63 4 27 42 54 71 14 23 39 59 63 8 17 35 55 61 15 26 42 53 71 10 25 31 57 64 6 20 44 52 68 Sample Output: 1 2
