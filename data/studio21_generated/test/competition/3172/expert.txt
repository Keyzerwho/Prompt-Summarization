 You are given N different fruits. You need to determine the maximum number of fruits that can be sliced with a single straight-line swipe. 
-----Input----- The first line has a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$). The next $n$ lines each have two real numbers giving the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a fruit. All coordinates have an absolute value no larger than $10^4$ and are given with exactly two digits after the decimal point. Fruits may overlap. -----Output----- Output the maximum number of fruits that can be sliced with one straight-line swipe. A swipe slices a fruit if the line intersects the inner part or the boundary of the fruit. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 1.00 5.00 3.00 3.00 4.00 2.00 6.00 4.50 7.00 1.00 Sample Output 1: 4 Sample Input 2: 3 -1.50 -1.00 1.50 -1.00 0.00 1.00 Sample Output 2: 3
