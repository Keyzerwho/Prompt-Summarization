 You are given an array of integers $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$; $1 \leq m \leq 200$) — the number of stations and the number of candies, respectively. The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains two space-separated integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq n$; $a_i \neq b_i$) — the station that initially contains candy $i$ and the destination station of the candy, respectively. -----Output----- In the first and only line, print $n$ space-separated integers, the $i$-th of which is the minimum time, in seconds, the train would need to deliver all the candies were it to start from station $i$. -----Examples----- Input 5 7 2 4 5 1 2 3 3 4 4 1 5 3 3 5 Output 10 9 10 10 9  Input 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 2 Output 5 6  -----Note----- Consider the second sample. If the train started at station $1$, the optimal strategy is as follows.  Load the first candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the first candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the second candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the second candy.  Proceed to station $1$. This step takes $1$ second.  Load the third candy onto the train.  Proceed to station $2$. This step takes $1$ second.  Deliver the third candy.  Hence, the train needs $5$ seconds to complete the tasks. If the train were to start at station $2$, however, it would need to move to station $1$ before it could load the first candy, which would take one additional second. Thus, the answer in this scenario is $5+1 = 6$ seconds.
