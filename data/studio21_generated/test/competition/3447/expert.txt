 You are given a word $w$ of length $n$. Your task is to output the number of key presses needed to type $w$. 
-----Input----- The input begins with an integer $1 \le N \le 200000$ giving the size of the dictionary, followed by $N$ lines, giving the words of the dictionary from most common to least common. Words consist solely of lower case ’a’-’z’ and are at most 10 characters long. Then follows an integer $1 \le Q \le 1000$ giving the number of words to type. This is followed by $Q$ lines, each containing a nonempty word to type. It will always be possible to type the given words using the given dictionary. The total length of all $Q$ words to type will be at most $500000$. -----Output----- For each query, output a line containing any optimal keypress solution in the following format.  - For pressing any of the digits 2-9, simply output that digit.  - For pressing right, output ’R’.  - For pressing up or down $x > 0$ times, output “U($x$)” or “D($x$)”, respectively. Note that the minimum number of keypresses may be very big: it can exceed $2^{32}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 echo 1 echoecho Sample Output: 3246R3246
