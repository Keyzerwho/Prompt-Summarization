 Given a string of length N, you need to find the number of distinct strings that can be formed by 0 or more operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 10^6  - S is a string of length N consisting of A, B, and C. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N S -----Output----- Print the number of distinct strings that S can be after zero or more operations, modulo (10^9+7). -----Sample Input----- 5 ABAAC -----Sample Output----- 11 For example, the following sequence of operations turns S into ACB:  - First, choose i=2. We replace S_2 with C and remove S_3, turning S into ACAC.  - Then, choose i=3. We replace S_3 with B and remove S_4, turning S into ACB.
