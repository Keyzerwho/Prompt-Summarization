 You are given $N$ people. Each person has a list of topics they agree on. You are tasked with finding the largest possible committee where every member disagrees. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, $N$ the number of members in the party, and $K$ as described above. Each member is indicated by an integer $i$ between $0$ and $N-1$. After the first line follow $N$ lines, one for each politician $i$, starting with $i = 0$. The line for politician $i$ begins with an integer $D_ i$, and is followed by $D_ i$ integers indicating with which other party members the $i$-th politician disagrees according to the Book of Great Achievements. We always have $0 \leq D_ i < N \leq 50000$, and $1 \leq K \leq 10$. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the size of the largest possible comittee. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 2 1 2 3 0 2 3 3 0 1 4 2 1 4 2 2 3 Sample Output: 3
