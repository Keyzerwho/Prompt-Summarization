 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the maximum possible area of smallest piece he can get with exactly k cuts. 
-----Input----- A single line contains three integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9; 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^9). -----Output----- Output a single integer representing the answer. If it is impossible to cut the big chocolate k times, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 1 Output 6 Input 6 4 2 Output 8 Input 2 3 4 Output -1 -----Note----- In the first sample, Jzzhu can cut the chocolate following the picture below:  [Image]  In the second sample the optimal division looks like this:  [Image]  In the third sample, it's impossible to cut a 2 × 3 chocolate 4 times.
