 You are given a set of implications and evidence collected by your colleague detectives. Find all events that have certainly occurred based on the given implications and evidence.
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of three integers, $D$ ($1 \le D \le 1000$), the number of different types of events, $M$ ($1 \le M \le 100000$), the number of implications, and $N$ ($1 \le N \le D$), the number of events known to have occurred. Each of the $M$ lines that follow contains two integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \le A, B \le D$), describing an implication $A \rightarrow B$. Finally, each of the last $N$ lines contains an integer $X$ ($1 \le X \le D$) describing an event that is known to have occurred, based on the evidence collected by detectives. -----Output----- The first and only line of output should contain integers (in increasing order) representing events that have certainly occurred. -----Explanation of sample cases----- In Sample Input 2, the knowledge base contains implications $1 \rightarrow 3$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$. Therefore, Holmes knows that event $3$ can be caused only by events $1$ and $2$, but (without any extra information), he can’t be certain which one of those events actually caused $3$. As a result, the only event that must have occurred is the one given in the input. In Sample Input 3, Holmes doesn’t know which event from the set $\{ 2, 3\} $ is directly responsible for event $4$. However, as both of those events are caused only by event $1$, Holmes can deduce that event $1$ must have occurred. As a consequence, events $2$, $3$ and $4$ (given by the detectives) have also occurred. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 2 1 1 2 2 3 2 Sample Output 1: 1 2 3 Sample Input 2: 3 2 1 1 3 2 3 3 Sample Output 2: 3
