 You are given two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution. You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of the input will consist of two space separated integers $k$ and $n$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 2500$), where $k$ is the size of the team you must form, and $n$ is the total number of employee candidates. Each of the following $n$ lines will hold three space-separated integers describing an employee. Employee $1$ will be described first, then employee $2$, and so on. The three integers are $s$, $p$ and $r$, where $s$ ($1 \le s \le 10000$) is the employee’s salary, $p$ ($1 \le p \le 10000$) is the employee’s productivity, and $r$ ($0 \le r<i$) is the employee number of the employee who recommended this candidate (where $i$ is the employee number of this candidate). -----Output----- Output a single real number, which represents the maximum total value you can achieve forming a team of $k$ employees, subject to the constraints of the problem. Output this number to exactly three decimal places, rounded (standard $5 \uparrow / 4 \downarrow $ rounding). -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 2 1000 1 0 1 1000 1 Sample Output: 0.001
