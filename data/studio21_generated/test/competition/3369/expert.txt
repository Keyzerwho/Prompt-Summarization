 You are given a sequence of digits and must search it for triple correlations. 
-----Input----- Input starts with a positive integer $p$ ($p \leq 1000$) indicating the number of random digits in the sequence. Starting on the next line will be the $p$ digits, separated by spaces and potentially spread across multiple lines. No line will contain more than $100$ digits and there will be no blank lines. -----Output----- Display triple correlation a(n)b(m)c found if it occurs in the list (with the appropriate values for a, b, c, n, and m filled in) or the phrase random sequence otherwise. If there are multiple triple correlations in the sequence, display the one which begins earliest in the sequence. If there is still a tie, choose the one with the smaller value of n, and if there is still a tie, choose the one with the smaller value of m. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 100 4 7 9 5 9 3 5 0 0 1 7 8 5 0 2 6 3 5 4 4 4 6 3 3 2 7 1 8 7 8 7 6 1 1 7 2 5 4 7 2 0 4 4 5 8 3 0 6 9 3 2 6 6 8 5 2 5 1 2 7 2 4 1 0 0 4 9 1 8 7 5 0 4 4 8 4 3 2 6 8 8 5 6 7 0 9 7 0 3 6 1 4 4 1 2 3 2 6 9 9 Sample Output: triple correlation 4(1)4(3)3 found
