 You are given numbers $L$, $R$, $A$ and $B$. You are given an array of integers. Return the number of stones in some range of boxes. Each box can be labeled between $L$ and $R$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000000000$) ($1 \leq Q \leq 50000$), number of boxes and number of queries. The next $Q$ lines contain information about the simulation. If the line starts with 1, than it follows the format “1 $L$ $R$ $A$ $B$” ($1 \leq L \leq R \leq N$) ($1 \leq A, B \leq 1000000$), meaning that Aladin keyed in numbers $L$, $R$, $A$ and $B$ in the device and allowed the device to do its job. If the line starts with 2, then it follows the format “2 L R” ($1 \leq L \leq R \leq N$), meaning that Aladin wonders how many stones in total are ther stones are in boxes labeled $L$ to $R$ (inclusive). -----Output----- For each query beginning with 2 output the answer to that particular query. Queries should be processed in the order they are given in the input.First sample description The boxes start containing $\{ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\} $, 0 stones in total. After that the device sets the stones to $\{ 1 \mod 2, 2 \mod 2, 3 \mod 2, 4 \mod 2, 5 \mod 2, 0\} $ = $\{ 1,0,1,0,1,0\} $, or 3 stones in total. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 3 2 1 6 1 1 5 1 2 2 1 6 Sample Output 1: 0 3 Sample Input 2: 4 5 1 1 4 3 4 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 4 4 Sample Output 2: 3 2 1 0
