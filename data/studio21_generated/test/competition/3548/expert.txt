 You are given a list of $N$ distinct drink ingredients. You need to find how many different sets of drinks can be made using exactly $K$ ingredients for the first drink, $L$ ingredients for the second drink, and so on. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $1 \le N \le 100000$ and $0 \le P \le 100000$, the number of ingredients and bad pairs of ingredients. Each of the next $P$ lines contains two integers $1 \le a \not= b \le N$, two ingredients that do not work well together in a drink. The same pair of ingredients may appear multiple times in this list. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the number of nights Pia can construct a different set of drinks. Since this number may be large, output the remainder when divided by $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 3 1 3 4 5 2 4 Sample Output: 5
