 Given a base $B$ and a number $N$, find the smallest positive integer $X$ such that $f_ B(X) = N$. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single line containing two integers $B$ and $N$, satisfying $2 < B \leq 10000$ and $0 < N < 2^{63}$. -----Output----- Output the smallest positive integer solution $X$ of the equation $f_ B(X) = N$. If no such $X$ exists, output the word “impossible”. The input is carefully chosen such that $X < 2^{63}$ holds (if $X$ exists). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 24 Sample Output 1: 38 Sample Input 2: 10 11 Sample Output 2: impossible Sample Input 3: 9 216 Sample Output 3: 546
