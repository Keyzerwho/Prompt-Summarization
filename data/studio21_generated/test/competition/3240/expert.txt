 You are given $k$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k$. You are given $v$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_v$. You have to find the number of ballots you should cast to maximize Yraglac s expected number of positions. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers $1 \leq k \leq 16$, the number of positions, and $2 \leq v \leq 100$, the number of voters (including yourself). It is followed by $v - 1$ lines, each containing two space-separated numbers: a decimal $0 \leq p_ i \leq 1$, the probability of voter $i$ casting ballots, and an integer $0 \leq b_ i \leq 2^k - 1$, the number of ballots voter $i$ would cast should they vote. -----Output----- Output on a single line the number of ballots $0 \leq b_ v \leq 2^k - 1$ you should cast to maximize the expected number of positions held by Yraglac. The answer is guaranteed to be unique. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 2 0.5 1 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 4 3 1 11 0.4 1 Sample Output 2: 3
