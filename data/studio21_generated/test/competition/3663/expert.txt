 You have a map of world and all your available transport routes between them. Each route connects two nations and has a fixed cost per army that uses it. The routes are laid out such that there is exactly one way to travel between any two nations. You know the current position of each of your armies and how many you will need to place permanently in each nation in order to subjugate it. How can you move the armies into place as cheaply as possible so you can Conquer The World 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 250000$), the number of nations. This is followed by $n-1$ lines, each containing three integers $u$, $v$, and $c$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $1 \le c \le 10^6$), indicating that there is a bidirectional route connecting nations $u$ and $v$, which costs $c$ per army to use. Finally, another $n$ lines follow, the $i^{\text {th}}$ of which contains two non-negative integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$, indicating that there are currently $x_ i$ armies in nation $i$, and you need at least $y_ i$ armies to end up in that nation in the final configuration. The total number of armies (the sum of the $x_ i$ values) is at least the sum of the $y_ i$ values, and no more than $10^6$. -----Output----- Display the minimum cost to move your armies such that there are at least $y_ i$ armies in nation $i$ for all $i$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 2 5 3 1 5 2 1 5 0 1 3 Sample Output: 15
