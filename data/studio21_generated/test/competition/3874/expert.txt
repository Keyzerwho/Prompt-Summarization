 Given n files in a dir and a pattern, delete only those files that match the pattern. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100) — the total number of files and the number of files to be deleted. The following n lines contain filenames, single filename per line. All filenames are non-empty strings containing only lowercase English letters, digits and dots ('.'). The length of each filename doesn't exceed 100. It is guaranteed that all filenames are distinct. The last line of the input contains m distinct integer numbers in ascending order a_1, a_2, ..., a_{m} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n) — indices of files to be deleted. All files are indexed from 1 to n in order of their appearance in the input. -----Output----- If the required pattern exists, print "Yes" in the first line of the output. The second line should contain the required pattern. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. If the required pattern doesn't exist, print the only line containing "No". -----Examples----- Input 3 2 ab ac cd 1 2 Output Yes a? Input 5 3 test tezt test. .est tes. 1 4 5 Output Yes ?es? Input 4 4 a b c dd 1 2 3 4 Output No Input 6 3 .svn .git .... ... .. . 1 2 3 Output Yes .???
