 You are given two coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$. You are asked to calculate the coordinates $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$ of the robotic arm tip. 
-----Input----- The first line contains $N$, the number of segments composing the robotic arm. $N$ lines follow, each with an integer $L_ i$ describing the length of the $i$th segment from the fixed point until the arm’s tip. There is one more line with $2$ integers: the $x$, $y$ coordinates of the target point to reach. -----Constraints----- $1$ $\leq $ $N$ $\leq $ $20$ Number of segments in the robotic arm $1$ $\leq $ $L_ i$ $\leq $ $1000$ Length of the $i$th segment $-20000$ $\leq $ $x, y$ $\leq $ $20000$ Target coordinates to attempt to reach -----Output----- The output should contain $N$ lines, each containing two real numbers $x_ i$, $y_ i$ indicating the coordinates of the tip of the $i$th segment. The length of the $i$th segment computed from the solution and input $L_ i$ may not differ by more than $0.01$. Similarly, the absolute error between the solution’s distance to the target and the minimum possible distance to the target cannot exceed $0.01$. Note that, in general, there are many solutions. Your program may output any of them. -----Explanation for Sample Input 1----- Sample output 1 corresponds to the drawing on the left: The drawing on the right corresponds to the following, equally acceptable output for sample input 1: 3.923 3.100 1.118 2.037 5.000 3.000 -----Explanation for Sample Input 2----- -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 5 3 4 5 3 Sample Output: 4.114 -2.842 6.297 -0.784 5.000 3.000
