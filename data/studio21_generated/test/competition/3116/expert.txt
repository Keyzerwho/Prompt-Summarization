 You are given a set of $n$ 3D points.  Find the smallest volume cylinder that encloses them. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input will contain a single integer $n$ ($4 \le n \le 1000$), representing the number of stars. Each of the next $n$ lines will contain three integers $x$, $y$ and $z$ ($-1000 \le x, y, z \le 1000$), representing the position of a single star. No two stars will be at the same position. No four stars will be coplanar. -----Output----- Output a floating point number representing the smallest volume cylinder that can enclose all the stars. Your answer must be accurate within a relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 Sample Output 1: 1.57079633 Sample Input 2: 4 -100 0 0 10 0 10 -10 -10 -10 0 0 0 Sample Output 2: 41938.65135885
