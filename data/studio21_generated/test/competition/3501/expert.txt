 You have $n$ camels. The $i$-th camel starts with a value of $i$. The camel values will be revised $q$ times. For the $j$-th revision, camel $v_i$ will have a value of $n+i$. The camel $v_i$ will have this value for the only the $j$-th revision, it will have value $i$ otherwise. Some camels dislike with each other, if two camels $a$ and $b$ dislike with each other and $a$ has a higher value than $b$ then $a$ conflicts with $b$. A dangerous triple is three camels $a$, $b$, $c$ such that $a$ conflicts with $b$ and $b$ conflicts with $c$. You need to find the number of pairs of camels for which this happened before the revisions and after each revision. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with an integer $n$ ($2\leq n \leq 200000$), the number of camels;  - one line with $n$ integers $a_1, \ldots , a_ n$ ($1 \le a_ i \le n$ for all $i$), Jaap’s bet. Here $a_1$ is the camel in the first position of Jaap’s bet, $a_2$ is the camel in the second position, and so on;  - one line with Jan’s bet, in the same format as Jaap’s bet;  - one line with Thijs’ bet, in the same format as Jaap’s bet. The camels are numbered $1, \dots , n$. Each camel appears exactly once in each bet. -----Output----- Output the number of pairs of camels that appear in the same order in all $3$ bets. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 Sample Output: 0
