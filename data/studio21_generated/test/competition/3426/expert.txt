-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$, where $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ and $N - 1 \leq M \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, the number of stations and the number of tunnels, respectively. Each of the next $M$ lines contains the values $a_ i$, $b_ i$, $l_ i$ and $c_ i$. The integers $a_ i$ and $b_ i$, with $1 \leq a_ i, b_ i \leq N$ and $a_ i\neq b_ i$, denote the two stations connected by the $i$th tunnel. The value $l_ i$ is either an integer satisfying $1 \leq l_ i \leq 10^9$, the length of the $i$th tunnel if it is known, or a question mark “?”. Finally, $c_ i$ is $1$ if the $i$th tunnel contains a cable, and $0$ if not. It is guaranteed that there is at most one tunnel connecting the same pair of stations, and that it is possible to travel between any pair of stations using the subway. It is also guaranteed that there exists a path between any station and station number $1$ using only tunnels where $c_ i = 1$. -----Output----- For each tunnel with $l_ i=\texttt{?}$, output one line with a single integer, the minimum possible length for that tunnel. Tunnel lengths should be output in the same order as the tunnels are listed in the input. -----Sample Description----- In the first sample case, the minimal distance for the unknown tunnel (between stations $3$ and $1$) is $5$. This is because, if the length were less than $5$, it would be more efficient for Skånetrafiken to run cables through the second and third tunnels. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 1 2 5 1 2 3 3 1 3 1 ? 0 Sample Output: 5
