 Given an array of icons, find the minimum number of icons to move so that all of the icons in the array can be grouped together. 
-----Input----- The input will start with four integers $n_ r$ $n_ c$ $n$ $m$ which indicate the number of pixel rows and columns in the screen $(1 \leq n_ r, n_ c \leq 10000)$, the number of file icons on the screen to be deleted $(n)$ and the number of file icons on the screen that should not be deleted $(m)$, where $n+m \leq 100$. After this will be a set of $2(n+m)$ integers indicating the location of the $n+m$ files, the first $n$ of which are the files to be deleted. Each pair of numbers $r$ $c$ will specify the row and col of the upper left corner of the file icon, where $0 \leq r < n_ r$ and $0 \leq c < n_ c$. All icons are 15 pixels high by 9 pixels wide in size and no two icons will be at the same location, though they may overlap, and at least one pixel of the icon must always reside on the screen (both initially and after theyâ€™ve been moved). Edges of a delete rectangle lie on pixel boundaries. -----Output----- Output the minimum number of file icons that must be moved in order to delete all the appropriate files in one delete operation. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 80 50 3 2 75 5 25 20 50 35 50 5 25 35 Sample Output: 2
