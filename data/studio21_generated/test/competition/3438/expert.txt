 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$. The value of an element can not go below 0. You must evaluate the performance of the monkey and answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers, separated by single spaces, telling you how many objects fit in the cache, $0 < c \le 10000$, how many different objects are in the system, $c \le n \le 100000$, and how many accesses, $0 \le a \le 100000$, will occur. The following $a$ lines contain a single integer between $0$ and $n-1$ (inclusive) indicating what object is accessed. The first line corresponds to the first object accessed access and the last line to the last. -----Output----- Output the least number of times an object must be read into the cache to handle the accesses listed in the input. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 2 3 0 0 1 Sample Output: 2
