 you are given a partially filled magic checkboard. You need to fill the remaining locations on the checkboard, so that the sum of all values is as small as possible. 
-----Input----- Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. Each input starts with a line with two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 2000$), representing the number of rows ($n$) and the number of columns ($m$) of the checkerboard. Each of the next $n$ lines will contain $m$ space-separated integers $c$ ($0 \le c \le 2000$), representing the contents of the checkerboard. Zero is used for cells without numbers that you must fill in. You may use any positive integers to fill in the cells without numbers, so long as you form a valid Magic Checkerboard. You are not limited to numbers $\le 2000$, and the numbers are not required to be unique. -----Output----- Output a single integer representing the minimum sum possible by replacing the 0 cells with positive integers to form a valid Magic Checkerboard. Output $-1$ if it is not possible to replace the 0 cells to meet the constraints of a Magic Checkerboard. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 4 1 2 3 0 0 0 5 6 0 0 7 8 7 0 0 10 Sample Output 1: 88 Sample Input 2: 4 4 1 2 3 0 0 0 5 6 0 4 7 8 7 0 0 10 Sample Output 2: -1
