 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. The first line of this test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$), where $n$ is the length of the tape art in inches. The next line contains $n$ integers $c_ i$ ($1 \le c_ i \le n$) representing the color of one inch of the plank. Planks are divided into $n$ $1$-inch sections numbered $1$ through $n$. -----Output----- Output any set of instructions that, when executed, will result in the tape art given by the input. The set of instructions should start with the number of instructions that follow. Each instruction must consist of three numbers: $l$$r$ $c$ where $[l, r]$ represents the inclusive range on which the tape should be placed and $c$ represents the color of the tape piece. Output the string “IMPOSSIBLE” if the piece of tape art cannot be reconstructed using only one piece of each color (Sheila must have broken the rules to make it or this piece is a forgery). -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 1 2 3 3 2 1 Sample Output 1: 3 1 6 1 2 5 2 3 4 3 Sample Input 2: 4 1 2 1 2 Sample Output 2: IMPOSSIBLE
