 Given a description of a string, you must determine its maximum possible nesting level. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$). The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$ ($1 \le a_ i \le 100$), which describe a string as follows. The string starts with $a_1$ quote characters, which are followed by a positive number of non-quote characters, which are followed by $a_2$ quote characters, which are followed by a positive number of non-quote characters, and so on, until the string ends with $a_ n$ quote characters. -----Output----- Display the largest number $k$ such that a string described by the input is a $k$-quotation. If there is no such $k$, display no quotation instead. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 2 1 1 1 3 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 1 22 Sample Output 2: 4
