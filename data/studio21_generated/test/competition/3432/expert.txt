 Given two numbers $A$ and $B$, both smaller than 100, determine $n$ pairings $(a_ i, b_ j)$ such that each number in the $A$ sequence is used in exactly one pairing, each number in the $B$ sequence is used in exactly one pairing, and the maximum of all sums $a_ i + b_ j$ is minimal. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100000$), the number of rounds. The next $N$ lines contain two integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 \leq A, B \leq 100$), the numbers given by Slavko in that round. -----Output----- The output consists of $N$ lines, one for each round. Each line should contain the smallest maximal sum for that round. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 2 8 3 1 1 4 Sample Output: 10 10 9
