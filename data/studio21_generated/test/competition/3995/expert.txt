 Given two positive integers $n$ and $k$, such that $(n \bmod 2) = (k \bmod 2)$, where $(x \bmod 2)$ is operation of taking remainder of $x$ by dividing on $2$. Find any string $s$ consisting of $n$ symbols "0" or "1", such that the length of its minimal unique substring is equal to $k$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$, separated by spaces ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 100\,000$, $(k \bmod 2) = (n \bmod 2)$). -----Output----- Print a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of symbols "0" and "1". Minimal length of the unique substring of $s$ should be equal to $k$. You can find any suitable string. It is guaranteed, that there exists at least one such string. -----Examples----- Input 4 4 Output 1111 Input 5 3 Output 01010 Input 7 3 Output 1011011 -----Note----- In the first test, it's easy to see, that the only unique substring of string $s = $"1111" is all string $s$, which has length $4$. In the second test a string $s = $"01010" has minimal unique substring $t =$"101", which has length $3$. In the third test a string $s = $"1011011" has minimal unique substring $t =$"110", which has length $3$.
