 As most of you might know already, a prime number is an integer `n` with the following properties: * it must be greater than 1 * it must be divisible only by itself and 1 And that's it: -15 or 8 are not primes, 5 or 97 are; pretty easy, isn't it  Well, turns out that primes are not just a mere mathematical curiosity and are very important, for example, to allow a lot of cryptographic algorithms. Being able to tell if a number is a prime or not is thus not such a trivial matter and doing it with some efficient algo is thus crucial. There are already more or less efficient (or sloppy) katas
