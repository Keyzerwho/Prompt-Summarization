 Given an integer, you need to find all the numbers greater or equal to that integer that the sum of every four consecutive digits cannot be higher than a certain given value. If the number is num = d1d2d3d4d5d6, and the maximum sum of 4 contiguous digits is maxSum, then: d1 + d2 + d3 + d4 <= maxSum d2 + d3 + d4 + d5 <= maxSum d3 + d4 + d5 + d6 <= maxSum For that purpose, you need to write a function, max_sumDig
