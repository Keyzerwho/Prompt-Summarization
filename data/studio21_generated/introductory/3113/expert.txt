 Your task is to write a function with signature `distribute(m, n)` in which `m` represents how many candies there are, while `n` represents how many children there are. The function should return a container which includes the number of candies each child gains. # Notice 1. *The candy can't be divided into pieces.* 2. The list's order doesn't matter. # Requirements 1. The case `m < 0` is equivalent to `m == 0`. 2. If `n <= 0` the function should return an empty container.
