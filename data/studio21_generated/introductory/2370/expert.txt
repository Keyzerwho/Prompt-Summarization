 you are given a sequence of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2000$) — the length of $a$. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 26$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$. Note that the maximum value of $a_i$ can be up to $26$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$ ($\sum n \le 2000$). -----Output----- For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible length of some subsequence of $a$ that is a three blocks palindrome. -----Example----- Input 6 8 1 1 2 2 3 2 1 1 3 1 3 3 4 1 10 10 1 1 26 2 2 1 3 1 1 1 Output 7 2 4 1 1 3
