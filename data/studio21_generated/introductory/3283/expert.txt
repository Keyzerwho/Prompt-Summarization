 You are given a string. Translate it to Union Jack. ## Other points * The smallest flag you can make without it looking silly is 7x7. If you get a number smaller than 7, simply _make the flag 7x7_. * If you get a decimal, round it _UP to the next whole number_, e.g. 12.45 would mean making a flag that is 13x13. * If you get something that's not a number at all, *return false*.
