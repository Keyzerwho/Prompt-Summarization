 You are given an array of robots. Each robot has coordinates (x, y). Each robot can perform four actions. You have to find a set of coordinates (x, y) where all robots can reach.
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$) — the number of queries. Then $q$ queries follow. Each query begins with one line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of robots in the query. Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of these lines describes the $i$-th robot in the current query: it contains six integer numbers $x_i$, $y_i$, $f_{i, 1}$, $f_{i, 2}$, $f_{i, 3}$ and $f_{i, 4}$ ($-10^5 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^5$, $0 \le f_{i, j} \le 1$). The first two numbers describe the initial location of the $i$-th robot, and the following four numbers describe which actions the $i$-th robot can use to move ($f_{i, j} = 1$ if the $i$-th robot can use the $j$-th action, and $f_{i, j} = 0$ if it cannot use the $j$-th action). It is guaranteed that the total number of robots over all queries does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- You should answer each query independently, in the order these queries appear in the input. To answer a query, you should do one of the following:  if it is impossible to find a point that is reachable by all $n$ robots, print one number $0$ on a separate line;  if it is possible to find a point that is reachable by all $n$ robots, print three space-separated integers on the same line: $1$ $X$ $Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are the coordinates of the point reachable by all $n$ robots. Both $X$ and $Y$ should not exceed $10^5$ by absolute value; it is guaranteed that if there exists at least one point reachable by all robots, then at least one of such points has both coordinates not exceeding $10^5$ by absolute value. -----Example----- Input 4 2 -1 -2 0 0 0 0 -1 -2 0 0 0 0 3 1 5 1 1 1 1 2 5 0 1 0 1 3 5 1 0 0 0 2 1337 1337 0 1 1 1 1336 1337 1 1 0 1 1 3 5 1 1 1 1 Output 1 -1 -2 1 2 5 0 1 -100000 -100000
