 Create a function to play a game. The function should accept two parameters: first is the card and the second is the suit. If the cards have the same suit, return 'Let's play again.' If the cards have different suits (and no one has trump) return 'Let's play again.' If one card has `trump` unlike another, wins the first one. If both cards have `trump`, the big one wins. If `card1` wins, return 'The first card won.' and vice versa. If the cards are equal, return 'Someone cheats.'
