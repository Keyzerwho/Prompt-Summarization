 A box contains green, red, and blue balls. The total number of balls is given by `n` (`0 < n < 50`). Each ball has a mass that depends on the ball color. Green balls weigh `5kg`, red balls weigh `4kg`, and blue balls weigh `3kg`. Given the total number of balls in the box, `n`, and a total mass, `m`, your task is to craft a program that will determine the quantities of each colored ball. Return a list of these quantities as the answer. Don't forget that some
