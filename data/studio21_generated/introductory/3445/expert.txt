 Given two non-negative integers, return their sum and gcd in ascending order. If the numbers do not exist, return -1 (or NULL in C, tuple (-1,-1) in C#, pair (-1,-1) in C++, None in Rust, array {-1,-1} in Java and Golang). Note that [4,6] is also a possibility but we pick the one with the lower first element: 2 < 4, so we take [2,8].
