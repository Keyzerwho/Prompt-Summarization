 Write a regular expression to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages. These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before: * hello - english * ciao - italian * salut - french * hallo - german * hola - spanish * ahoj - czech republic * czesc - polish By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!! PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test
