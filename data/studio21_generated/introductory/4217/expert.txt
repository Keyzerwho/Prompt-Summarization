 If the first day of the month is a Friday, it is likely that the month will have an `Extended Weekend`. That is, it could have five Fridays and five Saturdays and five Sundays.  In this Kata, you will be given a start year and an end year. Your task will be to find months that have extended weekends and return: ```- The first and last month in the range that has an extended weekend- The number of months that have extended weekends in the range, inclusive of start year and end year. ``` More examples in test cases. Good luck! If you found this Kata easy, please try [myjinxin2015](https://www.codewars.com/users
