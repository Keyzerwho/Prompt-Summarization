 You are given a square matrix with side length $n$ consisting of 0 and 1. You wonder if the training actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots such that, after the training, you get the given matrix. Each cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots. Before the training, each cell of the polygon contains 0. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the size of the polygon. This is followed by $n$ lines of length $n$, consisting of 0 and 1 — the polygon matrix after the training. The total area of the matrices in all test cases in one test does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case print:  YES if there is a sequence of shots leading to a given matrix;  NO if such a sequence does not exist.  The letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case. -----Example----- Input 5 4 0010 0011 0000 0000 2 10 01 2 00 00 4 0101 1111 0101 0111 4 0100 1110 0101 0111 Output YES NO YES YES NO -----Note----- The first test case was explained in the statement. The answer to the second test case is NO, since a 1 in a cell ($1, 1$) flying out of any cannon would continue its flight further.
