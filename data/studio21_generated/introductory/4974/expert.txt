 You're putting together contact information for all the users of your website. You queried your database and got back a list of users, where each user is another list with up to two items: a string representing the user's name and their shipping zip code. Write a function that takes a two-dimensional list like the one above and returns a dictionary with an item for each user where the key is the user's name and the value is the user's zip code. If your data doesn't include a zip code then the value should be `None`.
