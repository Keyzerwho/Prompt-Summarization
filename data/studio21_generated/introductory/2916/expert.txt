 =====Problem Statement===== You are given an array containing two rolls of the die (1-6) and the probability of each roll. Your task is to return a decimal representing the probability of a single roll of the die returning either of the given rolls. If the total probability of the six rolls doesn't add up to one, there is a problem with the die; in this case, return null.  Return your result as a string to two decimal places. Example below: `1 : 1/6` `2 : 1/6` `3 : 1/6` `
