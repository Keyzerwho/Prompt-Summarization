 The AKS algorithm for testing whether a number is prime is a polynomial-time test based on the following theorem:  A number p is prime if and only if all the coefficients of the polynomial expansion of `(x   1)^p   (x^p   1)` are divisible by `p`. For example, trying `p = 3`:      (x   1)^3   (x^3   1) = (x^3   3x^2 + 3x   1
