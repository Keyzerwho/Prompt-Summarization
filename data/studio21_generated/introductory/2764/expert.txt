 We are interested in collecting the triples of positive integers ```(a, b, c)``` that fulfill the following equation: ```python a  + b  = c  ``` The first triple with the lowest values that satisfies the equation we have above is (2, 2 ,2). In effect: ```python 2  + 2  = 2  4  + 4  = 8 ``` The first pair of triples that "shares" the same value of ```c``` is:
