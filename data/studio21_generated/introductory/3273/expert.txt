 In this problem, two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a palindrome game. Alice starts with `string1`, Bob starts with `string2`, and the board starts out as an empty string. Alice and Bob take turns; during a turn, a player selects a letter from his or her string, removes it from the string, and appends it to the board; if the board becomes a palindrome (of length >= 2), the player wins. Alice makes the first move. Since Bob has the disadvantage of playing second, then he wins automatically if letters run out or the board is never a palindrome. Note also that each player can see the other
