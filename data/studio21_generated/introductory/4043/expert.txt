 You are given a game map. The array contains information about 2 games. Each game has 2 rows and 2 columns. Each row and column represents one path. John starts from the top-left corner, walks to the bottom-right corner. John can walk only downward or right. The sum of the numbers collected by the players will be used as the bonus. John has two chances to play this game on a game map. Specifically, when John finishes the game, the card on his path will be removed, and then he can walk again. Your task is to help John calculate the maximum amount of bonuses he can get.
