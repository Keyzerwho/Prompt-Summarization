 You will have a list of rationals in the form [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... , [numer_n, denom_n] ] where all numbers are positive integers. You have to produce their sum N / D in an irreducible form: this means that N and D have only 1 as a common divisor. Return the result in the form: - [N, D] in Ruby, Crystal, Python, Clojure, JS, CS, PHP, Julia - Just "N D" in Haskell, PureScript - "[N, D
