 You are given a partner instance. The responses are: positive or neutral. You can try to get a response once a day, thus you have n * 7 tries in total to find the main love language of your partner!   Note: your partner may (and will) sometimes give a positive response to any love language ("false positive"), but the main one has a much higher possibility. On the other hand, you may get a neutral response even for the main language, but with a low possibility ("false negative"). There will be 50 tests. Although it's difficult to fail, in case you get unlucky, just run the tests again
