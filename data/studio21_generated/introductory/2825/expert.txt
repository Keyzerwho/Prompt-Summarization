 A Magic Square contains the integers 1 to n^(2), arranged in an n by n array such that the columns, rows and both main diagonals add up to the same number.For doubly even positive integers (multiples of 4) the following method can be used to create a magic square. Fill an array with the numbers 1 to n^(2) in succession. Then, for each 4 by 4 subarray, replace the entries on the blue and red diagonals by n^(2)+1-aij. So,
