 Given ```water``` amount of water to wash ```clothes``` amount of clothes. You are given a ```load``` amount of clothes to wash. For each single item of load above the standard amount of clothes, the washing machine will use 10% more water (multiplicative) to clean. For example, if the amount of clothes is ```10```, the amount of water it requires is ```5``` and the load is  ```14```, then you need ```5 * 1.1 ^ (14 - 10)
