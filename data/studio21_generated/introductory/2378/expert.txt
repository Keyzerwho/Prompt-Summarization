 Your robot has initial instructions $s$. You need to remove as few instructions as possible and rearrange the remaining ones so that the sequence is valid. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The next $q$ lines contain test cases. The $i$-th test case is given as the string $s$ consisting of at least $1$ and no more than $10^5$ characters 'L', 'R', 'U' and 'D' — the initial sequence of instructions. It is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ (where $|s|$ is the length of $s$) does not exceed $10^5$ over all test cases ($\sum |s| \le 10^5$). -----Output----- For each test case print the answer on it. In the first line print the maximum number of remaining instructions. In the second line print the valid sequence of remaining instructions $t$ the robot has to perform. The moves are performed from left to right in the order of the printed sequence. If there are several answers, you can print any. If the answer is $0$, you are allowed to print an empty line (but you can don't print it). -----Example----- Input 6 LRU DURLDRUDRULRDURDDL LRUDDLRUDRUL LLLLRRRR URDUR LLL Output 2 LR 14 RUURDDDDLLLUUR 12 ULDDDRRRUULL 2 LR 2 UD 0 -----Note----- There are only two possible answers in the first test case: "LR" and "RL". The picture corresponding to the second test case: [Image] Note that the direction of traverse does not matter  Another correct answer to the third test case: "URDDLLLUURDR".
