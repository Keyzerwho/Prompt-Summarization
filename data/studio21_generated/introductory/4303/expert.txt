 ## Description The task is described in the title: find the sum of all numbers with the same digits(permutations) **including** duplicates. However, due to the fact that this is a performance edition kata, `num` can go up to `10**10000`. That's a number with 10001 digits(at most). Be sure to use efficient algorithms and good luck! All numbers tested for will be positive. **Examples** ``` sum_arrangements(98) returns 89+98 = 187 sum_arrangements(123) returns 1332 #
