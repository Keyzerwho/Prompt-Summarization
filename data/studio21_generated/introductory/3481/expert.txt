 Write a method that takes a string as an argument and groups the number of time each character appears in the string as a hash sorted by the highest number of occurrences. The characters should be sorted alphabetically e.g: ```python get_char_count("cba") == {1: ["a", "b", "c"]} ``` You should ignore spaces, special characters and count uppercase letters as lowercase ones. For example:  ```python get_char_count("Mississippi")           ==  {4: ["i", "
