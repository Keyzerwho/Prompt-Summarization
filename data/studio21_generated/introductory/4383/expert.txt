 You are given a garden consisting of 5 rectangular sections of heights `4, 2, 3, 3, 2`. Creating the artificial rain over the left-most section is inefficient as the water **WILL FLOW DOWN** to the section with the height of `2`, but it **WILL NOT FLOW UP** to the section with the height of `3` from there. Only 2 sections will be covered: `4, 2`. The most optimal choice will be either of the sections with the height of `3` because the water will flow to its neighbours covering
