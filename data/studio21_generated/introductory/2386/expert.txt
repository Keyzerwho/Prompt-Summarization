 you are given a permutation. It is merged with itself. You need to restore the original permutation. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 400$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$) — the length of permutation. The second line of the test case contains $2n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n}$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$), where $a_i$ is the $i$-th element of $a$. It is guaranteed that the array $a$ represents the result of merging of some permutation $p$ with the same permutation $p$. -----Output----- For each test case, print the answer: $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$), representing the initial permutation. It is guaranteed that the answer exists and is unique. -----Example----- Input 5 2 1 1 2 2 4 1 3 1 4 3 4 2 2 5 1 2 1 2 3 4 3 5 4 5 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 2 3 2 4 1 3 4 1 Output 1 2  1 3 4 2  1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3  2 3 4 1
