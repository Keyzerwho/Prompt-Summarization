 Given an array of scores, return the array of ranks for each value in the array.  The largest value has rank 1, the second largest value has rank 2, and so on. Ties should be handled by assigning the same rank to all tied values. For example:     ranks([9,3,6,10]) = [2,4,3,1] and     ranks([3,3,3,3,3,5,1]) = [2,2,2,2,2,1,7]
