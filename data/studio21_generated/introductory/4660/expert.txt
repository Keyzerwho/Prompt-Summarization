 You are given three numbers - a present moment (current hour), a start hour of allowed time period and an end hour of allowed time period. The function should give answer to a question (as a boolean): "Can Vasya play in specified time " If I say that prime-time is from 12 till 15 that means that at 12:00 it's OK to play computer but at 15:00 there should be no more games. I will allow Vasya to play at least one hour a day.
