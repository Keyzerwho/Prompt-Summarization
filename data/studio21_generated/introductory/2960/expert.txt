 In this kata you need to create a function that takes a 2D array/list of non-negative integer pairs and returns the sum of all the "saving" that you can have getting the [LCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) of each couple of number compared to their simple product. For example, if you are given: ``` [[15,18], [4,5], [12,60]] ``` Their product would be: ``` [270, 20, 720] ``` While their respective LCM would be: ``` [90,
