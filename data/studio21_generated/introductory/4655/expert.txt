 Sort array by last character Complete the function to sort a given array or list by last character of elements. ```if-not:haskell Element can be an integer or a string. ``` ### Example: ``` ['acvd', 'bcc']  -->  ['bcc', 'acvd'] ``` The last characters of the strings are `d` and `c`. As `c` comes before `d`, sorting by last character will give `['bcc', 'acvd']`.
