 Given a string, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".  We shall assign the following values: "a" = 1, "b" = 2, "c" = 3, .... "z" = 26. For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z". For C: do not mutate input. More examples in test cases. Good luck! If you like this Kata, please try: [
