 Calculate the trace of a square matrix. A square matrix has `n` rows and `n` columns, where `n` is any integer > 0. The entries of the matrix can contain any number of integers. The function should return the calculated trace of the matrix, or `nil/None` if the array is empty or not square; you can otherwise assume the input will be valid (of the form described below). The trace of an n-by-n square matrix **A** is defined to be the sum of the elements on the main diagonal (the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right) of
