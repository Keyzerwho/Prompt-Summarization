 Your code must test that all array items are numbers and return ```"invalid array"``` if it finds that either item is not a number.  The provided array will always contain 2 elements. When the inputs are valid, they will always be integers, no floats will be passed.  However, you must take into account that the numbers will be of varying magnitude, between and within test cases.
