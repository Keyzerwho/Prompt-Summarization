 Given an array, you return the third maximum number in the array. If it does not exist, you return the maximum number. 
Example 1: Input: [3, 2, 1] Output: 1 Explanation: The third maximum is 1. Example 2: Input: [1, 2] Output: 2 Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead. Example 3: Input: [2, 2, 3, 1] Output: 1 Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number. Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
