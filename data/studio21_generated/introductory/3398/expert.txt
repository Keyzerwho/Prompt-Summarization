 In this Kata, we define an arithmetic progression as a series of integers in which the differences between adjacent numbers are the same. You will be given an array of ints of `length > 2` and your task will be to convert it into an arithmetic progression by the following rule: ```Haskell For each element there are exactly three options: an element can be decreased by 1, an element can be increased by 1  or it can be left unchanged. ``` Return the minimum number of changes needed to convert the array to an arithmetic progression. If not possible, return `-1`. ```Haskell For example:  solve(
