 Chuck has lost count of how many asses he has kicked... Chuck stopped counting at 100,000 because he prefers to kick things in the face instead of counting. That's just who he is. To stop having to count like a mere mortal chuck developed his own special code using the hairs on his beard. You do not need to know the details of how it works, you simply need to know that the format is as follows: 'A8A8A8A8A8.-A%8.88.' In Chuck's code, 'A' can be any capital letter and '8' can be any number 0-9 and any %, - or . symbols must not be changed.
