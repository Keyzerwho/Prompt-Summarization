 You are given a positive integer `n`. Your task is to count the number of such sequences:  - It should be an ascending sequence; - It should end with number `n`. - Each number in the sequence should smaller or equals to the half of its right, except for the last number `n`. - We define that a sequence containing only a number `n` is a valid ascending sequence. # Examples For `n = 6`, the output should be `6`. All sequences we made are: ``` [6] insert a number to the left: [1,6]
