 Given an integer n, sc_perm_comb(n) is the total sum of all the numbers obtained from permutations of all the possible combinations of its digits. For example we have the number 348. If the number has a digit 0, the numbers formed by a leading 0 should be discarded. If the number has digits that occur more than once, the score the adden will not be taken than twice or more. If the number has only one digit its score is the same number. Enjoy it!!
