 Write a function to calculate compound tax using the following table: For $10 and under, the tax rate should be 10%. For $20 and under, the tax rate on the first $10 is %10, and the tax on the rest is 7%. For $30 and under, the tax rate on the first $10 is still %10, the rate for the next $10 is still 7%, and everything else is 5%. Tack on an additional 3% for the portion of the total above $30. Return 0 for invalid input(anything that's not a positive real number)
