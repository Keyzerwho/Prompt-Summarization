 You are given a string which is composed from tokens of the form 'n1-n2,n3,n4-n5:n6' where 'nX' is a positive integer. Each token represent a different range: 'n1-n2' represents the range n1 to n2 (inclusive in both ends). 'n3' represents the single integer n3. 'n4-n5:n6' represents the range n4 to n5 (inclusive in both ends) but only includes every other n6 integer. The output should be a list of integers
