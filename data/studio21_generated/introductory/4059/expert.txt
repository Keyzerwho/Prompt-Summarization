 You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   Example 1: Input: [1,2,3,6] Output: 6 Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum =
