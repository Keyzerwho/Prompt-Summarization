 We will use the Flesch Kincaid Grade Level to evaluate the readability of a piece of text. This grade level is an approximation for what schoolchildren are able to understand a piece of text. For example, a piece of text with a grade level of 7 can be read by seventh-graders and beyond. The way to calculate the grade level is as follows:     (0.39 * average number of words per sentence) + (11.8 * average number of syllables per word) - 15.59 Write a function that will calculate the Flesch Kincaid grade level for any given string. Return the grade level rounded to two decimal points. Ignore hyphens, dashes
