 A magic square is an arrangement of distinct numbers (i.e., each number is used once), usually integers, in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers in the main and secondary diagonals, all add up to the same number, called the "magic constant." For example, the following "square":       4    9    2 -> 15       3    5    7 -> 15       8    1    6 -> 15
