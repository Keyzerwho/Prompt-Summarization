 Given an integer `n`, find the exact value of integral of f on the interval `[0, pi]` (pi being 3.14159265359...). ## Notes: - Don't round or truncate your results. See in "RUN EXAMPLES" the function `assertFuzzyEquals` or `testing`. - `n` will always be even. - We know that the exact value of the integral of f on the given interval is `2`. You can see:  about rectangle method and trapezoidal rule.
