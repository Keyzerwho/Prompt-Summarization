 You are guaranteed to hit every target that you try to hit. You cannot hit consecutive targets though because targets are only visible for one second (one at a time) and it takes you a full second to reload your water-gun after shooting (you start the game already loaded).   Given an array `vals` with the order of each target's point value, determine the maximum number of points that you can win.
