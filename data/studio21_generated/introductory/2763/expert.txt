 In mathematics, a [Diophantine equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation) is a polynomial equation, usually with two or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are sought or studied. In this kata we want to find all integers `x, y` (`x >= 0, y >= 0`) solutions of a diophantine equation of the form: #### x^(2) - 4 \* y^(2) = n (where the unknowns are `x`
