 You are given a String S. We need to convert S to Goat Latin. The rules of Goat Latin are as follows: If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append "ma" to the end of the word.         For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.           If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".         For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
