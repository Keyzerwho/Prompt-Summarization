 You are given an array with some bits. there three possible combinations of bits 10, 11, 0. convert array to string and find if the last charecter should be a one bit charecter or not  Example 1: Input:  bits = [1, 0, 0] Output: True Explanation:  The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character. Example 2: Input:  bits = [1, 1, 1, 0
