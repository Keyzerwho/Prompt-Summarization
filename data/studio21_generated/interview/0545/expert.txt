 You are given positive integers K, N, and i. You are asked to find if Chef could save some time by skipping some island. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, K. The i-th of the next lines will contain first an integer Pi, denoting the number of ingredients grown in the i-th island, followed by Pi distinct integers in the range [1, K]. All the integers are space separated.  -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing one of the strings "sad", "all" or "some" (without quotes) according to the situation.  -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T  ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ Pi ≤ K - Sum of Pi over all test cases ≤ 106 -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points) - 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 50 Subtask #2 (30 points) - 1 ≤ K ≤ 50 Subtask #3 (40 points) - original constraints -----Example----- Input 3 3 4 3 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 2 1 3 Output sad some all -----Explanation----- Example 1. The ingredient 4 is not available in any island, so Chef can't make the dish of life. Hence, the answer is "sad". Example 2. Chef can just go to the first island and collect all the three ingredients required. He does not need to visit the second island. So, the answer is "some". Example 3. Chef has to visit both the islands in order to obtain all the three ingredients. So, the answer is "all".
