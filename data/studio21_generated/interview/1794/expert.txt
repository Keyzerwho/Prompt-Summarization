 You are given two numbers `a` and `b`. You need to write a function `is_solution(a, b)` that returns `True` if and only if `a` and `b` could have been two numbers that Alice was thinking of. Hint: To get you started, think of what Samantha's first statement implies. Samantha knows that Patricia was not given the product of two primes. That means that the sum that Samantha was given cannot be written as the sum of two primes. Goldbach's conjecture stipulates that every even number greater than 3 can be written as the sum of two primes. Although Goldbach's conjecture
