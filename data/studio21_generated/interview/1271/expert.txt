 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $Q$. - Each of the next $Q$ lines contains a single integer $X$ describing a query. -----Output----- For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers $E$ and $O$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 5$ - $1 \le Q, X \le 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): - $1 \le Q \le 1,000$ - $1 \le X \le 128$ Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 3 4 2 7 -----Example Output----- 0 1 1 2 3 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: - Initially, the set is empty: $S = \{\}$. - After the first query, $S = \{4\}$, so there is only one element with an odd number of $1$-s in the binary representation ("100"). - After the second query, $S = \{4,2,6\}$, there is one element with an even number of $1$-s in the binary representation ($6$ is "110") and the other two elements have an odd number of $1$-s. - After the third query, $S = \{4,2,6,7,3,5,1\}$.
