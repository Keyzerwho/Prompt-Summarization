 Given an infinite array, find the minimum number of moves required to reach the goal cell. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains 3 space separated integers, H U D. -----Output----- For each test case, output one line with an integer, the minimum number of moves required to reach H from 0. If it is impossible, print -1 instead. -----Constraints----- -  T ≤ 10000 -  1 ≤ H, U, D ≤ 109 -----Sample Input----- 2 3 2 1 3 2 2 -----Sample Output----- 3 -1 -----Explanation----- -  In the first sample case, first move 2 steps to the right to reach cell number 2. Then 1 step to the left  to reach cell number 1 and finally 2 more steps to the right to reach the goal. Thus 3 moves are required which is the minimum. -  Because both U and D are even, you will always be in an even cell.Thus there is no way to reach cell      number 3. p { text-align:justify }
