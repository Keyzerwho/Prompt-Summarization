 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an interger T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single interger N, denoting the number of rules. Each of the next N lines contains two space-separated characters ci and pi, denoting a rule. The next line contains a string S, denoting the encrypted password. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the real password. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 0 ≤ N ≤ 94 - All characters in S and ci may be any ASCII printable character except space. (ASCII 33 - 126) - All ci in a single test case are distinct. - pi is a digit ("0" - "9") or a decimal point "." (ASCII 46). - The total length of S in a single input file will not exceed 106. -----Example----- Input: 4 2 5 3 3 1 5 0 01800.00 0 0.00100 3 x 0 d 3 # . 0xd21#dd098x Output: 3 1800 .001 321.33098
