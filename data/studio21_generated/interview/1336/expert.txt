 You are given two numbers. Find the number of digits you need to print. 
-----Input----- There will be multiple cases to consider. The input for each case has two integers, A and B, each of which is guaranteed to be positive. These identify the pages to be printed. That is, each integer P between A and B, including A and B, is to be printed. A single zero will follow the input for the last case. -----Output----- For each input case, display the case number (1, 2, â€¦) and the number of occurrences of each decimal digit 0 through 9 in the specified range of page numbers. Display your results in the format shown in the examples below. -----Example----- Input: 10 15 912 912 900 999 0 Output: Case 1: 0:1 1:7 2:1 3:1 4:1 5:1 6:0 7:0 8:0 9:0 Case 2: 0:0 1:1 2:1 3:0 4:0 5:0 6:0 7:0 8:0 9:1 Case 3: 0:20 1:20 2:20 3:20 4:20 5:20 6:20 7:20 8:20 9:120
