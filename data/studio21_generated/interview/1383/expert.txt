 There are $N$ Containers in company, which are labelled with $1$ to $N$ numbers. There are Total $N$ robots in Company, which are labelled $1$ to $N$. Each Robot adds $1$ litter Chemical in containers whose labels are multiple of robots label. (E.g. robot labelled 2 will add Chemical in containers labelled 2, 4, 6,  .). Robots follow few rules mentioned below: - Chemical with $pH<7$ is acidic
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains $3$ space separated Integers $N$, $K1$ and $K2$. - The second and last line contains $4$ space separated Integers $P1$, $P2$, $P3$ and $P4$ -----Output:----- For each test case, print total cost of packing of containers modulo 100000007. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 50000$ - $1 \leq P1, P2, P3, P4 \leq 2*10^7$ - $2 \leq N \leq 2*10^7$ - $1 \leq K1, K2 \leq N$ -----Subtasks-----Subtask #1 (20 points): - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq P1, P2, P3, P4 \leq 2*10^7$ - $2 \leq N \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq K1, K2 \leq N$Subtask #2 (80 points) : - Original Constraint -----Sample Input:----- 1 4 1 4 2 2 2 2 -----Sample Output:----- 8 -----Explanation:----- Letâ€™s use notation,  0 for acidic Chemical,  1 for Chemical with pH=7,  2 for basic Chemical, 3 for Containers with exactly 2 litter acid and 1 litter base, -1 for empty containers Initially 4 containers are empty so [-1, -1, -1, -1] Robot 1 adds 1 litter acid in all containers. [0, 0, 0, 0] Robot 2 adds base in containers labelled 2, 4 [0, 1, 0, 1] Robot 3 adds base in containers labelled 3 [0, 1, 1, 1] Robot 4 adds acid in containers labelled 4 because it contains Chemical with pH=7. After adding acid, it also contains exactly 2 litter acid and 1 litter base, so denoting it with 3. [0, 1, 1, 3] Corresponding cost of packing container [P2, P3, P3, P1] Now, calculate total cost, Cost = P2+P3+P3+P1 = 2+2+2+2 = 8
