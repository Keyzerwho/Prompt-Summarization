-----Input:----- - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.  - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N$.  -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line answer as the number of ways. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 3 -----Sample Output:----- 2 -----EXPLANATION:----- ways: [1,1,1], here chef climb to the next floor, one by one stair. [1,2], here chef climb to the next floor, one step first and after that 2 stairs at once. Note, [2,1] consider the same as that of [1,2] hence ignored.
