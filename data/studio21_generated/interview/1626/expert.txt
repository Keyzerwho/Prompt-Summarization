 Given an number (`n`), return the element at that index in the sequence, where `1   n   10^18`. Assume the indexes start with `1`, not `0`.  For example: ``` solve(1) = 1, because the first character in the sequence is 1. There is no index 0.  solve(2) = 1, because the second character is also 1. solve(3) = 2, because the third character is 2
