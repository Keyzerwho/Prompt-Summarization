 You are given a number $N$ and a value $k$. For every number from $1$ to $N$ if the number is divisible by $k$, you increment its value by 1. For example, if $N=11$ and $k=4$, numbers divisible by $k$ are $3, 5, 7, 9, 11$. Their values are $1, 2, 3, 4, 1$ correspondingly, their sum is $7$. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain a number $N$. -----Output:----- Output a single line, the new value of the number. -----Constraints----- - $0 \leq N \leq 1000$ -----Sample Input:----- 5 -----Sample Output:----- 4 -----EXPLANATION:----- Since 5 is not divisible by 4 hence, its value is decreased by 1.
