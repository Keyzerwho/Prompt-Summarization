 You are given a number $M$ and an integer $C$. For each valid $i$, you are asked to find the maximum value of $C$ such that Chef can sell drinks with flavors $i$ for a profit of at least $F_i$. For each valid $i$, you are also asked to find the maximum value of $C$ such that Chef can sell drinks with flavors $i$ for a profit of at least $B_i$. Example 1: Input: $M = 5$, $C = 1$, $F_1 = 2
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. - The second line contains $M$ space-separated integers $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_M$. - $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers $D_i$, $F_i$ and $B_i$. -----Output----- For each test case, print two lines: - The first of these lines should contain a single integer â€” the maximum profit. - The second line should contain $N$ space-separated integers denoting the flavours of the drinks Chef should sell, in this order. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 1,000$ - $2 \le N, M \le 10^5$ - $1 \le D_i \le M$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \le C_i \le N$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \le B_i < F_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - $C_1+C_2+\ldots+C_M \ge N$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ - the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ -----Example Input----- 1 5 3 1 2 3 2 6 3 2 10 7 2 50 3 1 10 5 1 7 4 -----Example Output----- 33 2 2 3 1 3
