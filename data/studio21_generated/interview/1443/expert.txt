 Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively. Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'. -----Output----- For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10 -----Example----- Input: 2 4 3 111 100 110 000 2 2 10 01 Output: 4 0 -----Explanation----- Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total. Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.
