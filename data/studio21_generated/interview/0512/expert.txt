 You are given N vertices numbered 1 to N and tree with N edges. The i-th edge in this tree connects vertex a_i and vertex b_i, and the color and length of that edge is c_i and d_i, respectively. Here the color of each edge is represented by an integer between 1 and N-1 (inclusive). The same integer corresponds to the same color, and different integers correspond to different colors. Answer the following Q queries:  - Query j (1 \leq j \leq Q): assuming that the length of every edge whose color is x_j is
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N Q a_1 b_1 c_1 d_1 : a_{N-1} b_{N-1} c_{N-1} d_{N-1} x_1 y_1 u_1 v_1 : x_Q y_Q u_Q v_Q -----Output----- Print Q lines. The j-th line (1 \leq j \leq Q) should contain the answer to Query j. -----Sample Input----- 5 3 1 2 1 10 1 3 2 20 2 4 4 30 5 2 1 40 1 100 1 4 1 100 1 5 3 1000 3 4 -----Sample Output----- 130 200 60 The graph in this input is as follows: Here the edges of Color 1 are shown as solid red lines, the edge of Color 2 is shown as a bold green line, and the edge of Color 4 is shown as a blue dashed line.  - Query 1: Assuming that the length of every edge whose color is 1 is changed to 100, the distance between Vertex 1 and Vertex 4 is 100 + 30 = 130.  - Query 2: Assuming that the length of every edge whose color is 1 is changed to 100, the distance between Vertex 1 and Vertex 5 is 100 + 100 = 200.  - Query 3: Assuming that the length of every edge whose color is 3 is changed to 1000 (there is no such edge), the distance between Vertex 3 and Vertex 4 is 20 + 10 + 30 = 60. Note that the edges of Color 1 now have their original lengths.
