 Given an n x n array, count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 
-----Input----- - The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases. - The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers n, m as defined in the statement. -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single integer in a line corresponding to the answer of the problem. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T, n, m ≤ 100 -----Example----- Input: 2 2 1 3 2 Output: 1 4 -----Explanation----- In the first example, there are two people. Second person is Malvika and she has to teach only one topic to the first person. It will take only one hour to do so. In the second example, there are three people. The 3rd person is Malvika and she has to teach only two topics to 1st and 2nd person. In the 1st hour, she teaches the 1st topic to the 2nd person. Now, in the 2nd hour, the 2nd person will teach the 1st topic to the 1st person. In the 3rd hour, Malvika will teach the 2nd topic to the 2nd person. Now the 2nd person will teach that topic to the 1st in the 4th hour. So, it takes a total of 4 hours for all the people to know all the topics.
