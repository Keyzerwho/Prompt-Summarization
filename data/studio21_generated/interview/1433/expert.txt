 The Little Elephant loves lucky strings. Everybody knows that the lucky string is a string of digits that contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, strings "47", "744", "4" are lucky while "5", "17", "467" are not. The Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B. -----Output----- For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string. In this case you should print an empty line for the corresponding test case. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 1 ≤ |A| ≤ 20000 |A| = |B| Each character of A and B is a digit. Sum of |A| across all the tests in the input does not exceed 200000. -----Example----- Input: 4 4 7 435 479 7 8 1675475 9756417 Output: 7 74 777744 -----Explanation----- Case 1. In this case the only possible string C we can get is "7" and it is the lucky string. Case 2. If we reorder A and B as A = "543" and B = "749" the string C will be at first "749" and then becomes "74". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B. Case 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is "8" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits. Case 4. If we reorder A and B as A = "7765541" and B = "5697714" the string C will be at first "7797744" and then becomes "777744". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four "sevens" and two "fours" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string "777744".
