 You are given two strings $s$ and $c$ representing Jeff's product name and competitor's product name respectively. You need to find two indices $i$ and $j$ such that $s_i$ and $s_j$ are swapped such that the resulting string becomes strictly lexicographically smaller than $c$.   
Note: String $a$ is strictly lexicographically smaller than string $b$ if and only if one of the following holds:  $a$ is a proper prefix of $b$, that is, $a$ is a prefix of $b$ such that $a \neq b$;  There exists an integer $1 \le i \le \min{(|a|, |b|)}$ such that $a_i < b_i$ and $a_j = b_j$ for $1 \le j < i$.  -----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1500$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two space-separated strings $s$ and $c$ ($2 \le |s| \le 5000, 1 \le |c| \le 5000$). The strings $s$ and $c$ consists of uppercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ in the input is at most $5000$ and the sum of the $|c|$ in the input is at most $5000$. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing a single string, which is either  the new name which is obtained after swapping no more than one pair of characters that is strictly lexicographically smaller than $c$. In case there are many possible such strings, you can output any of them;  three dashes (the string "---" without quotes) if it is impossible.  -----Example----- Input 3 AZAMON APPLE AZAMON AAAAAAAAAAALIBABA APPLE BANANA Output AMAZON --- APPLE -----Note----- In the first test case, it is possible to swap the second and the fourth letters of the string and the resulting string "AMAZON" is lexicographically smaller than "APPLE". It is impossible to improve the product's name in the second test case and satisfy all conditions. In the third test case, it is possible not to swap a pair of characters. The name "APPLE" is lexicographically smaller than "BANANA". Note that there are other valid answers, e.g., "APPEL".
