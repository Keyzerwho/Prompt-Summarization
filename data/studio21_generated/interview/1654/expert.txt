 You are given an expression. Figure out the value of the unknown rune. If more than one digit works, give the lowest one. If no digit works, well, that's bad news for the professor - it means that he's got some of his runes wrong. output -1 in that case. Complete the method to solve the expression to find the value of the unknown rune. The method takes a string as a paramater representing the expression and will return an int value representing the unknown rune or -1 if no such rune exists.
