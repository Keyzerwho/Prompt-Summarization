 You are given $A$ and $B$, the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$ -----Example Input----- 1 2 6 -----Example Output----- 3 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.
