 You are given a positive integer n$n$. Your task is to write a program that, given n$n$, will return k$k$, the largest possible number of integers Vasya could have started with  
-----Input:----- The first line contains T$T$ , number of test cases per file. The only line in each testcase contains a single integer k−$k-$ the total number of integers in Vasya's notepad (2≤k≤1012$2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}$). -----Output:----- Print a single integer−$-$ the largest possible value of the starting number n$n$. It is guaranteed that at least one such number n$n$ exists, and the largest possible value is finite. -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤34$1 \leq  T \leq 34 $ - 2≤k≤1012$2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}$ -----Sample Input----- 3 2 3 100 -----Sample Output:----- 9 10 170
