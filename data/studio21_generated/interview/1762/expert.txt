 You are given K's path. Your task is to write a function that will find the area of the house interior when given K's path. Input Your function will receive a string as an argument. The string will consist of turns (`L` or `R`, for `left` and `right`, respectively) and positive integers, in an alternating sequence. `L`/`R` represents the turn direction made by K, and the integers mark the number of distance units to move forward. Output Your function should return an integer representing the area of the house, based on K's path. If K's path is not a valid
