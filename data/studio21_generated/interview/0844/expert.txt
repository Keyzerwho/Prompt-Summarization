 Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack and Evan's guess after each click. You need to return the number of open tweets. 
-----Input----- First line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 ≤ N, K ≤ 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following. - CLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 ≤ X ≤ N) - CLOSEALL -----Output----- Output K lines, where the ith line should contain the number of open tweets just after the ith click. -----Example----- Input: 3 6 CLICK 1 CLICK 2 CLICK 3 CLICK 2 CLOSEALL CLICK 1 Output: 1 2 3 2 0 1 Explanation: Let open[x] = 1 if the xth tweet is open and 0 if its closed. Initially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets. CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1 CLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2 CLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3 CLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2 CLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0 CLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1
