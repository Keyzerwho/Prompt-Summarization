 You have to arrange the beds in such a way that no two adjacent blocks have beds. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Next line contains $N$. - Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area. -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE". -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$ - $2 \leq N \leq 100$ -----Subtasks----- - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$ - 70 points : Original constraints -----Sample Input:----- 2 4 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 -----Sample Output:----- SAFE UNSAFE -----EXPLANATION:----- Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.
