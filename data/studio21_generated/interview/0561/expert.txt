 The input consists of N lines, each line contains N integers. 
-----Input----- First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion. -----Output----- Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 102 - 1 ≤ K,Ai ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 2  4 9 5 2 2 4 4 9 5 2 18 3 Output: YES NO -----Explanation----- Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru. Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion.
