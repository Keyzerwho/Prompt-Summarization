 You are given a string and a compression function. The input string has n characters and each string character has 8 bits. The compression function takes two strings and outputs a string. The compression function takes two strings and outputs a string. The compression function takes two strings and outputs a string. The input string and output string are both of length n. The compression function takes two strings and outputs a string. The compression function takes two strings and outputs a string. The compression function takes two strings and outputs a string. The compression function takes two strings and outputs
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input $S$ the string to be compressed.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line The difference in size. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- - 40 points : S will contain only a-z - 60 points : S will contain 0-9 characters also -----Sample Input:----- 1 aaabb -----Sample Output:----- -40 -----EXPLANATION:----- the resulting string will be a3b2 its size will be 80, original string size will be 40 so ans= 40-80
