 You are given a list of numbers. You need to write a method ```solve``` that accepts a list of numbers and returns a list of numbers.  If the system does not have a unique solution, return ```null```. For example :      "2x + 4y + 6z = 18"   "3y + 3z = 6"   "x + 2y = z - 3"    should result in a list:      x = 2   y = -1   
-----Input----- The input consists of several integers, one per line. Each integer is between -50 and 50, inclusive. -----Output----- As described in the problem statement. -----Example----- Input 0 1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9 10 Output f(10) = MAGNA NIMIS! f(-9) = -3642.00 f(-8) = -2557.17 f(-7) = -1712.35 f(-6) = -1077.55 f(-5) = -622.76 f(-4) = -318.00 f(-3) = -133.27 f(-2) = -38.59 f(1) = 6.00 f(0) = 0.00
