 You are given a list of integers $x_1, ..., x_n$ ($1 <= x_i <= N$ for each $i$). For each $i$, you are asked to find the maximum distance Miu can obtain.
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases   - The first line of each test case consists of a single integer $N$  - The second line of each test case consists of $N$ space-separated integers $X$$1$ $X$$2$ $X$$3$ â€¦ $X$$N$ -----Output:----- - For each test case print the answer in a single line, the maximum Distance of Peace Miu can obtain -----Constraints----- - 1 <= $T$ <= 100   - 2 <= $N$ <= 105  - -109 <= $X$$i$ <= 109  - Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed 106  -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points):  - $N$ <= 103  Subtask #2 (70 points):  - Original Constraints -----Sample Input:----- 2 6 7 -1 2 13 -5 15 4 6 10 3 12   -----Sample Output:----- 5 3   -----EXPLANATION:----- Test Case 1: The $1$st house has the maximum Distance of Peace, which is from the $3$rd house: $| 7 - 2 | = 5$ Hence, the answer is $5$
