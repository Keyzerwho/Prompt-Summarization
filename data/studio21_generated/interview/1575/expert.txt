 You are given a Rubik s cuboid with arbitrary dimensions, Apple wants to know how many cubies would be there, which comprise of exactly 2 color. 
-----Input----- The input contains several test cases.The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case comprises of 3 natural numbers, M,N & O, which denote the dimensions of the Rubiks Cuboid. -----Output----- For each test case you are required to output the number of  cubies which comprise of 2 squares, each of which is of a different color. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ <1000 - 1 ≤ M ≤ <100000 - 1 ≤ N ≤ <100000 - 1 ≤ O ≤ <100000 -----Example----- Input: 1 3 3 3 Output: 12
