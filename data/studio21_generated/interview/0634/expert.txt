 Given a set of symbols the alethiometer pointed out, help her find the maximum possible age of the Universe, which could correspond to a substring of the original string with atmost one letter changed. 
-----Input----- Each input consists of a single string S which is what Lyra recorded from the fourth needle's pointing. -----Output----- Output one number, the maximum possible answer. -----Constraints----- -  1  ≤ |S|  ≤ 1,000 -  S will only contain digits 0-9 and uppercase Latin letters.  -----Example----- Input1: 06454 Input2: C0D3C43F Output1: 6454 Output2: 3943 -----Explanation----- In the first example, there is no choice as to what the number can be. It has to be 6,454. In the second example, there are a total of 41 possible strings (one for the original, and 10 for changing each letter). You can verify that the maximum number as a substring is got by making the string "C0D3943F".
