 You are given N, M, please build a network with N computers and M connections, or state that it is impossible. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a pair of space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of computers and the number of connections. -----Output----- Output T blocks. If it is impossible to construct a network with the given parameters for the corresponding test case, output just -1 -1. Otherwise, output M lines, each of which contains a space-separated pairs of integers denoting the IDs of the computers that should be connected. Note that multiple connections between any pair of computers and connections connecting a computer to itself are implicitly not allowed due to the third requirement. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ M ≤ N * (N - 1) / 2 - 1 ≤ Sum of all N ≤ 1000 - Subtask 1 (21 point): 1 ≤ N ≤ 4 - Subtask 2 (79 points): 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 -----Example----- Input:2 10 1 5 5 Output:-1 -1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. There are not enough connections even to satisfy the first requirement. Example case 2. The obtained network satisfies all the requirements.
