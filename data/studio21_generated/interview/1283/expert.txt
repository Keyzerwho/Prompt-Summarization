 You are given an integer $n$. Chef wants to check if it is semi-prime. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to express $N$ as a sum of two semi-primes or "NO" otherwise. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 200$ - $1 \le N \le 200$ -----Example Input----- 3 30 45 62 -----Example Output----- YES YES NO -----Explanation----- Example case 1: $N=30$ can be expressed as $15 + 15 = (3 \cdot 5) + (3 \cdot 5)$. Example case 2: $45$ can be expressed as $35 + 10 = (5 \cdot 7) + (2 \cdot 5)$. Example case 3: $62$ cannot be expressed as a sum of two semi-primes.
