 Given N ml of each type of soup, serve some soup.  Return the probability that the soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time. 
Example: Input: N = 50 Output: 0.625 Explanation:  If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625. Notes:  0 <= N <= 10^9.  Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
