 You are given a string $s$ consisting of characters $a,b,c,d,e,f$. Find the number of ways (or length) in which $s$ can be converted to $abde$.   Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10^4 s, 0 <= s[i] <= 10^4 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days).  -Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$ - $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 10 8 10 6 -----Sample Output:----- 2 -----EXPLANATION:----- First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.
