 You are given an array $b$ of boys and an array $g$ of girls. Arrange them in an order such that no two boys are adjacent to each other, and no two girls are adjacent to each other. 
-----Input----- - The first line contains an integer, $t$, denoting the number of test cases. - The first line of each test case contains an integer, $n$, denoting the number of boys and girls in the classroom. - The second line of each test case contains $n$ space separated integers, $b_1,b_2, ... b_n$, denoting the heights of the boys. - The second line of each test case contains $n$ space separated integers, $g_1,g_2,... g_n$, denoting the heights of the girls. -----Output----- Print exactly $t$ lines. In the $i^{th}$ of them, print a single line containing "$YES$" without quotes if it is possible to arrange the students in the $i^{th}$ test case, or "$NO$" without quotes if it is not. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq t \leq 10$ - $1 \leq n \leq 100$ - $1 \leq b_i, g_i \leq 100$ -----Sample Input----- 1 2 1 3 2 4 -----Sample Output----- YES -----EXPLANATION----- The following arrangement would satisfy the given conditions: $[b_1, g_1, b_2, g_2]$. This is because the boys and girls and separated, and the height is in non-decreasing order.
