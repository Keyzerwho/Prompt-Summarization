 You are given a number $n$ and a value $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $m$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $K$, $x$, $D$. - The second line contains $K$ distinct space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_K$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of candies GukiZ had, or $-1$ if there is no valid sequence $p$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 50$ - $3 \le N \le 10^9$ - $1 \le K \le \mathrm{min}(N, 2 \cdot 10^4)$  - $1 \le x \le 2 \cdot 10^9$ - $1 \le D \le 10^9$ - $1 \le p_i \le x$ for each valid $i$ - All values $p_i$ from input are distinct -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (15 points): $1 \leq x, N, D \leq 15$  Subtask #2 (35 points): $1 \leq x, N, D \leq 10^5$  Subtask #3 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 4 3 5 3 2 1 5 3 2 8 2 3 8 -----Example Output----- 12 -1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got $p_1 = 2$ candies, the second student got $p_2 = 1$ and the third got $p_3 = 5$ candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is $x=5$. The best possible option is giving $p_4=4$ candies to the last student. Then, the fourth constraint (with $D=3$) is satisfied for all students. Only the pair of students $(2, 3)$ have numbers of candies that differ by more than $3$, but still, for each student, there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies. Example case 2: GukiZ made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence $p$. The answer is $-1$.
