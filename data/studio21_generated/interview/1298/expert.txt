 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow:  - The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of copies of the standard Batmobile. - The second line contains a sequence of N+1 space-separated integers, S0 to SN, sorted in non-decreasing order separated by space. S0 is the maximum speed of the standard Batmobile. S1 to SN denote the maximum speeds of the prototypes. -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single line containing an integer denoting the answer. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ Si ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 2 4 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 Output: 4 5
