 Given a string S of length N, Find the sum of all distinct permutations P of S, which, when treated as a number is magical. Two permutations are said to be distinct, if there is atleast one index where they differ.  As the sum can be very large, print the sum modulo 109+7$10^{9}+7$. 
-----Input:----- -The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases.  -Only line of each test case contains a string S$S$ of length N$N$, consisting only of digits between 0 to 9. -----Output:----- For each test case, print a single integer denoting the sum of all such magical Pi′s$Pi's$ modulo 109+7$10^{9}+7$. If no such Pi$Pi$ exists print "-1". -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤1000$1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - 2≤N≤1000$2 \leq N \leq 1000$ - String only consists of digits between 0 to 9, both inclusive. -----Subtasks----- - 10 points : 1≤N≤5$1 \leq N \leq 5$ - 40 points : 1≤N≤100$1 \leq N \leq 100$ - 50 points : Original Constraints -----Sample Input:----- 2 35566 31 -----Sample Output:----- 65536 -1 -----EXPLANATION:----- Only arrangement is 65536. No arrangement of 31 gives us a power of two.
