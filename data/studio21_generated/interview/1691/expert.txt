 You are given an array with some bits. there three possible combinations of bits 10, 11, 0. convert array to string and find if the last charecter should be a one bit charecter or not  Example 1: Input:  bits = [1, 0, 0] Output: True Explanation:  The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character. Example 2: Input:  bits = [1, 1, 1, 0
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m and C denoting the sizes of the matrix and the maximum number of the second-type questions. After that the judge will answer your questions and evaluate the resuts. Read more about that in the "Interaction with the judge" part of the statement.  -----Interaction with the judge----- To ask a first-type question you should print to the standard output one line containing seven space-separated integers 1 iL iR jL jR x y. To ask a second-type question you should print one line containing five space-separated integers 2 iL iR jL jR. After that you should read from the standard input one integer - answer to the question. To end the game you should print 3 and starting from next line print n lines, each of them contains m space-separated integers - your variant of the matrix A. After that your program must stop. Remember to flush the output after every line you print. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2.5 * 105 - 1 ≤ n * m ≤ 2.5 * 105 - 103 ≤ C ≤ 104 - 1 ≤ Ai, j ≤ 50 - 1 ≤ iL ≤ iR ≤ n - 1 ≤ jL ≤ jR ≤ m - 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 50 - 0 ≤ number of asked questions ≤ 5 * 105 - 1 ≤ Bi, j ≤ 50 - 1 ≤ a1, a2, a3 ≤ 10 ----- Scoring ----- Let B will be the matrix you output and diff = ∑ |Ai, j - Bi, j| for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m. The number of questions you asked is questions. The number of integers, you correctly guessed is correct(i. e. the number of elements i, j such that Ai, j = Bi, j).  The score for each test case will be: score = a1 * questions +  a2 * diff +  a3 * (n * m - correct). Your goal is to minimize this score. Your total score for the problem will be the sum of scores on all the test cases. -----Example----- Input: 3 3 10 4 0 3 1 6 Output: 1 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 3 3 1 3 1 1 1 3 3 1 3 2 2 1 1 2 3 3 1 1 2 3 3 1 3 3 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 -----Explanation----- [1, 2, 3] A = [3, 2, 1] [2, 2, 2] For this test case a1 = 1, a2 = 1 and a3 = 1. The score for this test case will be 1 * 5 + 1 * 4 + 1 * (9 - 6) = 12. ----- Test data generation ----- There will be four types of the test files. - Type #1: n = 10,  m = 25000 - Type #2: n = 100,  m = 2500 - Type #3: n = 250,  m = 1000 - Type #4: n = 500,  m = 500 There will be 5 test files of each type. During the contest, you will be shown the score for only one test file of each type. All elements of matrix A are randomly chosen. For each test case C is randomly chosen from interval [103 .. 104]. For each test case values a1, a2 and a3 are manually chosen.
