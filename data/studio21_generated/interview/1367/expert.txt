 Sebi lives in Chefland where the government is extremely corrupt that usually makes fool out of public by announcing eye catching but non-sustainable schemes. Recently there was a move to increase tourism in the country that was highly lauded. Sebi wants to examine whether the move has some potential or is a hogwash as usual. The Chefland is a city with very old road infrastructure. The city has N tourist places. All the places are reachable from each other. The corrupt administrators of the city constructed as few roads as possible just ensuring that all the places are reachable from each other, and those too have now gone old with potholes every here and there. Upon this, there is a toll tax for each road
-----Input----- There is a single test case per test file. The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of tourist spots in Chefland. Each of the he next N - 1 lines contains three space separated integers u, v, c, denoting that there is a road between tourist spot u and v which has a toll tax of c Rs. -----Output----- Output a single line containing the expected toll tax a tourist has to pay for visiting all the N spots after the construction of new road. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less than or equal to 1e-2. -----Constraints----- - 2 ≤ N ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ u, v ≤ N - 0 ≤ c ≤ 106 -----Example----- Input: 3 1 2 3 1 3 2 Output: 2.333333 -----Explanation----- Assume that the citizens construct the high class road between city 1 and 2. A tourist can visit all the places by just paying a toll tax of 2 Rs. If the high class road is constructed between city 1 and 3. All the places then can be visited by just paying a toll tax of 3 Rs. If the cities 2 and 3 are connected by the high class road. All the places can be visited by paying a toll tax of 2Rs.  Hence expected Rs. that a tourist has to pay in toll tax will be (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 7 / 3 = 2.333333
