 You are given a preference of customers $1, 2, \dots, K$ and $K$ smartphones. You need to find the price the customer has to pay for his preference. If no such phone is available, print $-1$
-----Input:----- - First Line contains $N$ and $Q$ - Second-line contains $N$ integers $P_1,P_2,...,P_N$ (Price) - Third line contains $N$ integers $B_1,B_2,...,B_N$ (Brand) - Each of the next Q lines contains a query, the query is describes below - First line of each quey contains $b$ and $K$ where $b$ is the size of the preference subset. - Second line of each query contains $b$ integers, describing the preference subset. -----Output:----- For each query, print the price to be paid. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq N, Q, P_i \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq B_i, b \leq 6$ - $1 \leq K \leq N$ -----Sample Input:----- 4 2 4 5 6 7  1 2 3 4  3 3 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6  -----Sample Output:----- 4 -1 -----Explaination----- Query 1: The preference subset is {1, 2, 3}, The prices of phones available of these brands are {4, 5, 6}. The third costliest phone is 4. Query 2: The preference subset is {4, 5, 6}, The prices of phones available of these brands are {7}. Fouth costliest phone is required, which is not available. Hence, answer is $-1$.
