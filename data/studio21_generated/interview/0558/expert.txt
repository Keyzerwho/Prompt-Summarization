 You are given a metro system. Find the earliest time at which you can reach a destination. 
-----Input:----- The first line contains two integers $M$ and $N$ indicating the number rows and columns in the metro system. This is followed by $M$ lines, lines $2, 3, …, M+1$, describing the trains along the $M$ rows. The first letter on each line is either F or O or S, indicating whether the train is a fast train, an ordinary train or a slow train. Following this, separated by a blank space, is an integer indicating the time at which this train starts running. The next $N$ lines, lines $M+2, M+3, …, N+M+1$, contain similar descriptions of the trains along the $N$ columns. The last line, line $N+M+2$, contains $5$ integers $a, b, c, d$ and $e$ where ($a$,$b$) is the starting station, $c$ is the starting time and ($d$,$e$) is the destination station. -----Output:----- A single integer indicating the earliest time at which one may reach the destination. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq M, N \leq 50$. - $1 \leq a, d \leq M$ - $1 \leq b, e \leq N$ - $1 \leq$ all times in input $\leq 20$ -----Sample Input----- 3 4 F 3  S 2 O 2 S 1 F 2 O 2 F 4 2 3 8 1 1  -----Sample Output----- 15
