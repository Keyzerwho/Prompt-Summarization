 Given two strings S1 and S2 consisting of uppercase English alphabets, Sherlock wants to find minimum value of ugliness if we consider all possible flower configurations. Note that a configuration is valid even if any of the petal length is 0.
-----Input----- First line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case consists of string S1 in one line followed by string S2 in the next line. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one possible way to make a flower. -----Output----- For each test case, output in one line the required answer. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ length(S1), length(S2) ≤ 105 -----Example----- Input: 2 ABCDE XXBCZQ BBB BBBBBB Output:  2 6 -----Explanation----- Test case 1: If we keep the configuration shown in statement, the ugliness is 2, which is minimum possible. Test case 2: One of the best configurations is B  B B B  B  B B B where petal lengths are 1, 3, 1, 2.
