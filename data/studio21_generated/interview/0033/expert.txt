 You are given n numbers. You should erase two numbers and replace them with a new number. You should do this $n - 1$ times. The final number should be as small as possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of integers written on the board initially. It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, in the first line, print the minimum possible number left on the board after $n - 1$ operations. Each of the next $n - 1$ lines should contain two integers — numbers $a$ and $b$ chosen and erased in each operation. -----Example----- Input 1 4 Output 2 2 4 3 3 3 1
