 You are given two graphs. You need to label the vertices of the two graphs such that the resulting graph is structurally similar to the given graphs. 
-----Input----- Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case will begin with an integer N, the number of vertices in both graphs. 2*N lines follow.  The first N lines describe the first graph, and the next N lines the second graph. Each graph description consists of N lines of N integers each. The i-th integer on the j-th line will be 1 if there is an edge between vertices i and j, and 0 otherwise. The i-th integer on the j-th line will always be equal to the j-th integer on the i-th line, and the i-th integer on the i-th line will always be 0. -----Output----- For each test case, output 2 lines with N integers each. Each line must contain a permutation of the integers 1 through N, and indicates how Chef should label the corresponding graph. -----Scoring----- Your score for each test case is the similarity of the 2 graphs using the labelling you provide. Your overall score is the average of your scores on the individual test cases. -----Sample Input----- 2 3 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 -----Sample Output----- 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 4 2 3 2 4 1 3 This output would score 2*0/3 = 0.0 on the first test case, and 2*2/4 = 1.0 on the second test case, for an overall score of 0.5. Note that better scores are possible. -----Test case generation----- For each official test file, T is 5. For each test case, N is randomly chosen between 30 and 75. A real number D is randomly chosen between 0.05 and 0.5. For each pair of vertices, an edge is added with probability D. This graph is output as the first graph. An integer C is randomly chosen between 0 and N*(N-1)/2. C distinct pairs of vertices are chosen. For each pair, if an edge currently exists between them, the edge is removed with probability (1-D). If no edge exists between them, one is added with probability D. Then, a random permutation is applied to the vertices of the graph, and it is output as the second graph. You may safely assume there will be no test cases where TOTAL is 0.
