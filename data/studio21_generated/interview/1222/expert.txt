 You are given a string S. You are to count the number of anagramic pairs of S (i.e. pairs of words S[1] and S[2] such that S[1] anagram of S[2]). 
-----Input----- The first line has an integer T which is the number of strings. Next T lines each contain a strings. Each string consists of lowercase english alphabets only. -----Output----- For each string, print the answer in a newline. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ length of each string ≤ 100 -----Example----- Input: 3 rama abba abcd Output: 2 4 0 -----Explanation----- rama has the following substrings: - r - ra - ram - rama - a - am - ama - m - ma - a Out of these, {5,10} and {6,9} are anagramic pairs. Hence the answer is 2. Similarly for other strings as well.
