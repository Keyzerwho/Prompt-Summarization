 You are given N teams. Each team has a strength. The expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. 
-----Input format----- Line 1 : A single integer, N. Line 2 : N space-separated integers, the strengths of the N teams. -----Output format----- A single integer, the total advertising revenue from the tournament. -----Sample input----- 4 3 10 3 5 -----Sample output----- 23 -----Test data----- In all subtasks, the strength of each team is an integer between 1 and 1,000 inclusive. - Subtask 1 (30 marks) : 2 ≤ N ≤ 1,000. - Subtask 2 (70 marks) : 2 ≤ N ≤ 200,000. -----Live evaluation data----- - Subtask 1: Testcases 0,1,2. - Subtask 2: Testcases 3,4,5. -----Note----- The answer might not fit in a variable of type int. We recommend that type long long be used for computing all advertising revenues. If you use printf and scanf, you can use %lld for long long.
