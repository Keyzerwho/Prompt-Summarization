 You are given a list of customers, their visit times, and their preferred temperature ranges. You need to determine if the restaurant can satisfy all customers. Example 1: Input: $t_i$, $l_i$, $h_i$, $n$ Output: true Explanation: $t_i$, $l_i$, $h_i$, $n$ are all satisfied (in that order). Example 2: Input: $t_i$, $l_i$, $h_i$, $n
-----Input----- Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant. Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive. The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$. -----Output----- For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Example----- Input 4 3 0 5 1 2 7 3 5 10 -1 0 2 12 5 7 10 10 16 20 3 -100 100 0 0 100 -50 50 200 100 100 1 100 99 -100 0 Output YES NO YES NO -----Note----- In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer.  In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time. In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.
