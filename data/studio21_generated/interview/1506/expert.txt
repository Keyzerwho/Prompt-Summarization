 You are given a binary matrix $A$ consisting of $N$ rows and $M$ columns. The rows are numbered from $1$ to $N$, columns are numbered from $1$ to $M$. Element at row $i$ ($1$   $i$   $N$) and column $j$ ($1$   $j$   $M$) is denoted as $A_{ij}$. All elements of $A$ are either $0$ or $1
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains two integers $N$ and $M$ — the number of rows and the number of columns in the matrix. - Each of the next $N$ lines contains a string of length $M$, where the $j^{th}$ character of $i^{th}$ line denotes the value of $A_{i,j}$.  - Next line contains an integer $Q$ — the number of queries. - Then follow $Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains four space-seperated integers $x_{1}$, $y_{1}$, $x_{2}$, $y_{2}$ — coordinates of the up left and bottom right cells of the query rectangle. -----Output:----- Print the matrix, in the form of $N$ strings, after performing all the queries. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq N,M \leq 1000$ - $0 \leq  A_{ij}  \leq 1$ - $1 \leq Q \leq 10^6$ - $1 \leq x_{1} \leq x_{2} \leq N$ - $1 \leq y_{1} \leq y_{2} \leq M$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 2 00 00 3 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2  -----Sample Output:----- 01 10 -----Explanation:----- Example case 1: After processing the 1st query 1 1 1 1, matrix becomes: [1000][1000]\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\ 00  \end{bmatrix} After processing the 2nd query 2 2 2 2, the matrix becomes: [1001][1001]\begin{bmatrix} 10 \\ 01  \end{bmatrix} After processing the 3rd query 1 1 2 2, matrix becomes: [0110][0110]\begin{bmatrix} 01 \\ 10  \end{bmatrix} We need to output the matrix after processing all queries.
