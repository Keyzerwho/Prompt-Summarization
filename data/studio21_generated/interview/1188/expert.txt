 You are given N values with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer N. Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri — the person whom the ith member reports to. -----Output----- Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order — the indices of potential killers. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ Ri ≤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0. - It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure. -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1 [50 points]: N ≤ 10000 - Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints -----Example----- Input: 6 0 1 1 2 2 3 Output: 4 5 6 -----Explanation----- The reporting structure:
