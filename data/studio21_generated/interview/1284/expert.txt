 Coach Khaled wants exactly $N/4$ students to receive each grade (A, B, C and D), so that the grades are perfectly balanced. The scores cannot be changed, but the boundaries between grades can. Your task is to find thresholds $x$, $y$ and $z$ that result in a perfect balance of grades. If there are multiple solutions, choose the one with the maximum value of $x+y+z$ (because coach Khaled wants seem smarter than his students). 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single line containing the integer $-1$; otherwise, print a single line containing three space-separated integers $x$, $y$ and $z$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 1,000$ - $4 \le N \le 100$ - $N$ is divisible by $4$ - $0 \le A_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 6 4 90 25 60 75 8 27 29 92 92 67 67 85 92 4 0 1 2 3 4 100 100 100 100 4 30 30 40 50 4 30 40 40 50 -----Example Output----- 60 75 90 -1 1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: The default distribution is the correct one. Example case 4: All students have the same score and grade, so there is no way to choose the thresholds and coach Khaled must resign.
