 You are given two integers x and y. Print the integer if it is possible. 
-----Input:----- - First line is T queires. - Next are T queries. - First line is N ( No of divisors except 1 and the number itself ) - Next line has N integers or basically the divisors. -----Output:----- Print the minimum possible x which has such divisors and print -1 if not possible. -----Constraints----- - 1<= T <= 30 - 1<= N <= 350 - 2<= Di <=10^6 -----Sample Input:----- 3 2 2 3 2 4 2 3 12 3 2 -----Sample Output:----- 6 8 -1 -----EXPLANATION:----- Query 1 : Divisors of 6 are ( 1,2,3,6) Therefore, Divisors except 1 and the number 6 itself are ( 2 , 3). Thus, ans = 6. Query 2 : Divisors of 8 are ( 1,2,4,8) Therefore, Divisors except 1 and the number 8 itself are ( 2 , 4). Thus, ans = 8. Query 3 : There is no such number x with only ( 1,2,3,12,x ) as the divisors.
