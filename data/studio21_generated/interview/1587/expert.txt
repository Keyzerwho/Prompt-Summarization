 Given two triangles, find all the triangles with integer sides which has the radius of inscribed circle (also known as incircle) equal to R. 
-----Input----- There is a single test case per test file. The only line of input contains an integer R. -----Output----- Output in first line single number - number of triangles satisfying statement. Order the sides of triangles in non-decreasing order. Output all triangles in non-decreasing order, i.e. order first by smallest sides, otherwise by second smallest sides, if first and second sides equal, then by third. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ R ≤ 100  -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1: (20 points)  1 ≤ R ≤ 3 - Subtask #2: (30 points)  1 ≤ R ≤ 20 - Subtask #3: (50 points)  Original constraints -----Example----- Input:2 Output:5 5 12 13 6 8 10 6 25 29 7 15 20 9 10 17
