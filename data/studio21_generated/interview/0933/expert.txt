 You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to write a test program that can determine whether a given string is correct and then whether it represents a correct knight move (irregardless of the situation on the chess board). 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer T <= 50000, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed the characters with ASCII-codes from 32 to 126. The length of the string is not greater than 10. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the word "Error" if the corresponding string does not represent the correct pair of cells on the chess board. Otherwise output "Yes" if this pair of cells represents the correct knight move and "No" otherwise. -----Example----- Input: 4 a1-b3 d2-h8 a3 c4 ErrorError Output: Yes No Error Error
