 
-----Input Format----- First Line contains an integer T, number of test cases. For each test case, first line contains a string - a sequence of balls faced by Abhishek. And, next line contains a string of characters "g" and "b" of length 26 characters. If the ith character of this string equals "1", then the i-th English letter is good, otherwise it's bad. That is, the first character of this string corresponds to letter "a", the second one corresponds to letter "b" and so on. And, the third line of the test case consists of a single integer k (0≤k≤|s|) — the maximum acceptable number of bad characters in a good substring. -----Output Format ----- For each test case, print a single integer — the number of distinct good substrings of string s. -----Constraints----- - 1<=T<=1000 - 1<=|s|<=2000 - 0<=k<=|s| -----Subtasks----- Subtask 1 : 20 Points - 1<=T<=10 - 1<=|s|<=20 - 0<=k<=|s| Subtask 2 : 80 Points  Original Constraints Sample Input 2 ababab bgbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb 1 acbacbacaa bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb 2 Sample Output 5 8 Explanation In the first test case there are following good substrings: "a", "ab", "b", "ba", "bab". In the second test case there are following good substrings: "a", "aa", "ac", "b", "ba", "c", "ca", "cb".
