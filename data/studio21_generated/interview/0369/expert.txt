 Given a binary matrix, you can flip it and the cells adjacent to it. Return the minimum number steps required to convert this matrix to a zero matrix or -1 if you cannot.   Example 1: Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]] Output: 3 Explanation: One possible solution is to flip (1, 0) then (0, 1) and finally (1, 1) as shown. Example 2: Input: mat = [[0]] Output: 0
