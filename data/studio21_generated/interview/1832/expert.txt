 Starting with an undirected graph (the "original graph") with nodes from 0 to N-1, subdivisions are made to some of the edges. The graph is given as follows: edges[k] is a list of integer pairs (i, j, n) such that (i, j) is an edge of the original graph, and n is the total number of new nodes on that edge.  Then, the edge (i, j) is deleted from the original graph, n new nodes (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)
