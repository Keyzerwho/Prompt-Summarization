 You are given a sequence of integers. Swap two adjacent integers.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum possible value of $S$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 1,000$ - $1 \le N \le 10^5$ - $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (50 points): - $N \le 20$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $200$ Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 4 2 1 4 3 4 7 6 3 2 -----Example Output----- 30 39 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Swap the first and second element of the initial sequence. Then, swap the third and fourth element of the resulting sequence. The final sequence $A$ is $(1, 2, 3, 4)$. Example case 2: Swap the second and third element to make the sequence $(7, 3, 6, 2)$.
