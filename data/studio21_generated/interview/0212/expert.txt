 Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1. We make a binary tree using these integers and each number may be used for any number of times. Each non-leaf node's value should be equal to the product of the values of it's children. How many binary trees can we make   Return the answer modulo 10 ** 9 + 7.
