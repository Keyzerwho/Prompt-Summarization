 Chef bought an electronic board and pen. He wants to use them to record his clients' signatures. The board is a grid with $N$ rows (numbered $1$ through $N$) and $M$ columns (numbered $1$ through $M$) of pixels. Initially, all pixels are white. A client uses the electronic pen to sign on the board; whenever the pen touches a pixel, this pixel becomes black. Note that a signature may be non-continuous (a client may lift the pen while signing). Chef stores a typical signature of his current client
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. - $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of the matrix $A$. - $N$ more lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains a string with length $M$ describing the $i$-th row of the matrix $B$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the error in the current signature. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 50$ - $2 \le N, M \le 25$ -----Example Input----- 5 3 3 100 010 000 000 010 001 4 4 0000 0110 0000 0011 1100 0000 1100 0000 3 3 100 000 001 000 010 000 3 3 000 010 000 100 000 001 3 3 111 000 000 001 001 001 -----Example Output----- 0 2 1 0 2
