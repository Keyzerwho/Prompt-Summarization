 You are given a list of $N$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum number of candies finished by both $A$ and $B$. NOTE:- We assume that it does not take any time to switch from one box to another. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains three lines of input. The first line of each test case contains $N$, the number of boxes. - The second line of each test case contains a sequence,$C_1$ ,$C_2$ ,$C_3$ . . . $C_N$ where $C_i$ denotes the number of candies in the i-th box.   - The third line of each test case contains an integer $X$ . -----Output:----- For each testcase, print two space separated integers in a new line - the number of boxes eaten by $A$  and  $B$ respectively.  -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$ - $1 \leq C_i \leq 1000000$ - $1 \leq X \leq 10$ - Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $300000$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask 1(24 points): - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq C_i \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq X \leq 10$ Subtask 2(51 points): original constraints -----Sample Input:----- 1 5 2 8 8 2 9 2 -----Sample Output:----- 4 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- $A$ will start eating candies in the 1st box(leftmost box having 2 candies) . $B$ will start eating candies in the  5th box(rightmost box having 9 candies) .As $A's$ speed is 2 times as that of $B's$, $A$ will start eating candies in the  2nd box while $B$ would still be eating candies in the 5th box.$A$ will now start eating candies from the 3rd box while $B$ would still be eating candies in the 5th box.Now both $A$ and $B$ will finish candies in their respective boxes at the same time($A$ from the 3rd box and $B$ from 5th box). Since $A$ has eaten more number of boxes($A$ has eaten 3 boxes while $B$ has eaten 1 box) till now,so $A$ will be eating candies in the 4th box. Hence $A$ has eaten 4 boxes and $B$ has eaten 1 box.
