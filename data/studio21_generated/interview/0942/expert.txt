 Given an array, find the maximum cost (in bits) of interesting sequences  
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows. - The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers: $N$ and $L$. - The second line of each testcase contains $N$ space separated integers: $A[1], A[2], \ldots, A[N]$. -----Output----- - For each testcase, output the answer in a new line. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 3$ - $1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^9$ - $2 \leq L \leq 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1: 7 points - It is guaranteed that $A[1] > A[2] > \ldots > A[N]$ - Note that the above condition implies that all elements are distinct. - $1 \leq N \leq 500$ - Subtask 2: 7 points - It is guaranteed that $A[1] \ge A[2] \ge \ldots \ge A[N]$ - $1 \leq N \leq 500$ - Subtask 3: 14 points - It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct. - $1 \leq N \leq 500$ - Subtask 4: 14 points - $1 \leq N \leq 500$ - Subtask 5: 25 points - It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct. - $1 \leq N \leq 3000$ - Subtask 6: 33 points - $1 \leq N \leq 3000$ -----Sample Input----- 1 6 3 2 4 1 12 3 5 -----Sample Output----- 3 -----Explanation----- We are looking for Interesting sequences of length 3. Some of them are: - (4, 2, 3): This is Interesting because $A[4] \ge A[2] \ge A[3]$. Its cost is $min \{ |2-4|, |3-2|\} = 1$. - (5, 1, 1): Cost is 0. - (2, 2, 2): Cost is 0. - (6, 1, 3): Cost is 2. - (6, 2, 5): Cost is 3. There are other Interesting Sequences of length 3 as well. But if you list them all out, you'll see that the maximum Cost is 3. Hence the answer is 3.
