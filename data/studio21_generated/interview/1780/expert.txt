 You are given an integer n. You need to return array with size of n, with values (integers) n - 1, n - 2, ..., 1. 
Notes: `Range` : difference between the highest and lowest values.  `Mean or Average` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers  in a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers. `Median` : The median is the number separating the higher half  of a data sample from the lower half.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) #Hints: Try to optimize your program to avoid timing out. Memoization can be helpful but it is not mandatory for being successful.
