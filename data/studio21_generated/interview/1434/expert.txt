 You are given a tree and a source and destination node. You need to calculate the cost of a path between source and destination. A path is a sequence of nodes. The cost of a path is the sum of costs of nodes in the path. 
-----Input----- - First line contains three integers N$N$ - number of vertices in the tree, NSP$NSP$ - number of special nodes in the tree and Q$Q$ - number of queries to answer.    - Second line contains N−1$N-1$ integers. If the i$i$th integer is Vi$V_i$ then there is an undirected edge between i+1$i + 1$ and Vi$V_i$ (i$i$ starts from 1$1$ and goes till N−1$N-1$).           - Third line contains N$N$ integers, the i$i$th integer represents cost of the i$i$th vertex.     - Fourth line contains NSP$NSP$ integers - these represent which nodes are the special nodes.     - Following Q$Q$ lines contains three integers each - SNODE$SNODE$, DNODE$DNODE$ and W$W$ for each query. -----Output----- For each query output a single line containing a single integer - the path value PV$PV$ between SNODE$SNODE$ and DNODE$DNODE$. -----Constraints:----- - 1≤$1 \leq $ Number of nodes ≤1000$ \leq 1000 $  - 0≤W≤1000$ 0 \leq W \leq 1000 $  - 1≤$ 1 \leq $ Number of special nodes ≤10$ \leq 10 $  - 0≤$ 0 \leq $ Cost of each node ≤1000$ \leq 1000 $  - 1≤$ 1 \leq $ Number of queries ≤1000$ \leq 1000 $ -----Sample Input----- 7 1 5 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 5 4 2 7 9 1 1 2 3 100 1 1 100 2 1 100 4 5 100 4 7 100       -----Sample Output:----- 6 6 6 20 16        -----Explanation:----- Consider query 4$4$. The only path is 4−>2−>1−>2−>5$4->2->1->2->5$. The two sets defined for this path are {3,2,5${3,2,5}$} and {3,5,7${3,5,7}$}. Pick subsets {3,2,5${3,2,5}$} and {3,7${3,7}$} from each set which minimizes PV$PV$. Note that node 2$2$ can repeat as it is in different paths (both to and from the pivot).
