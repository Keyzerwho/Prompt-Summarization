 You are given two buckets of water. The first bucket has $v_1$ volume of cold water at temperature $t_1$. The second has $v_2$ volume of hot water at temperature $t_2$. Chef wants to take a bath with at least $v_3$ volume of water which is at exactly $t_3$ temperature. To get the required amount of water, Chef can mix some water obtained from the first and second buckets. Mixing $v_x$ volume of water at temperature $t_x$ with $v_y$ volume of water at temperature $t_y$ yields $v_x + 
-----Input----- - The first line contains $n$, the number of test cases. $n$ cases follow. - Each testcase contains of a single line containing 6 integers $v_1, t_1, v_2, t_2, v_3, t_3$. -----Output----- - For each test case, print a single line containing "YES" if Chef can take a bath the way he wants and "NO" otherwise. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq v_1, v_2, v_3 \leq 10^6$ - $1 \leq t_1 < t_2 \leq 10^6$ - $1 \leq t_3 \leq 10^6$ -----Sample Input----- 3 5 10 5 20 8 15 5 10 5 20 1 30 5 10 5 20 5 20 -----Sample Output----- YES NO YES -----Explanation----- - Case 1: Mixing all the water in both buckets yields 10 volume of water at temperature 15, which is more than the required 8. - Case 2: It is not possible to get water at 30 temperature. - Case 3: Chef can take a bath using only the water in the second bucket.
