 You are given a sequence of N numbers. For each number, find the maximum score Calvin can get by playing this game. 
-----Input format----- • Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, N and k, with 1 ≤ k ≤ N. • Line 2 : A space-separated sequence of N integers, the numbers in squares 1, 2 . . . , N . -----Output format----- A single line with a single integer, the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing the game. -----Test Data----- The testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs. • Subtask 1 [30 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 3000. • Subtask 2 [70 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 106. In all subtasks, the number in each square is between −1000 and 1000 inclusive. -----Example----- Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above. -----Sample input----- 5 2 5 3 -2 1 1 -----Sample output----- 11 Note: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format. Please remove all diagnostic print statements before making your final submission. A program with extraneous output will be treated as incorrect!
