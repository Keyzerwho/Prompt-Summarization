 Given a sequence of letters S, determine whether there is a walk W which realizes S. If so, find the lexicographically least such walk. 
-----Input----- 	The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process. 	The only line of each testcase contains one string S. It is guaranteed that S only consists of symbols 'A'-'E'. -----Output----- 	The output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. For each testcase, if there is no walk W which realizes S, then output -1. Otherwise, you should output the least lexicographical walk W which realizes S. Since all of the vertices are numbered from 0 to 9, then it can be encoded as a string consisting of symbols '0'-'9' (see the "Examples" section for more details). -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 8; 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100000(105). -----Examples----- Input: 2 AAB AABE Output: 501 -1
