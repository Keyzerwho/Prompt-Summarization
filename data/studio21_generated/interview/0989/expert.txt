-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $X$, $Y$ and $K$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef is supposed to serve next or "Paja" otherwise (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 50$ - $0 \le X, Y \le 10^9$ - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 1 3 3 5 7 2 38657 76322 564 -----Example Output----- Paja Chef Paja -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Chef served for the first three games, after that Paja started serving.
