 You will be given a triple $(p,q,r)$. Your goal is to figure out if $(p,q,r)$ can be transformed into $(a,b,c)$ using minimum number of operations. 
Input: - The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers p, q and r. - The second line contains three space-separated integers a, b and c.Output: For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum required number of operations(if the conversion is possible), or else print "-1" Constraints: - $1 \leq T \leq 1,000$ - $2 \leq |p|,|q|,|r|,|a|,|b|,|c| \leq 10^9$Sample Input: 	1 	2 2 1 	3 3 2 Sample Output: 	3
