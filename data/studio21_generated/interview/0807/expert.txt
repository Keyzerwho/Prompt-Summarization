 You are given M queries asking for the maximum element in the pth subarray (1-based indexing). 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M, denoting the array size and the number of queries respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers denoting the array elements. Each of the next M lines contains a single integer - p. -----Output----- Output a single integer corresponding to the maximum element in the pth subarray. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 - 1 ≤ p ≤ N+1C2 -----Subtasks-----Subtask #1 (20 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 200 - 1 ≤ M ≤ 104 Subtask #2 (30 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 3000 - 1 ≤ M ≤ 104 Subtask #3 (50 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 5 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ M ≤ 105 -----Example----- Input:1 4 2 3 1 2 4 1 5 Output:4 3
