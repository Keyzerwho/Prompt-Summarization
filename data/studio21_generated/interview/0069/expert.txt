 Bertown is a city with $n$ buildings in a straight line. The city's security service discovered that some buildings were mined. A map was compiled, which is a string of length $n$, where the $i$-th character is "1" if there is a mine under the building number $i$ and "0" otherwise. Bertown's best sapper knows how to activate mines so that the buildings above them are not damaged. When a mine under the building numbered $x$ is activated, it explodes and activates two adjacent mines under the buildings numbered $x-1$ and $x+1$
-----Input----- The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 1000$) — the cost of activating and placing one mine, respectively. The next line contains a map of mines in the city — a string consisting of zeros and ones. The sum of the string lengths for all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of coins that the sapper will have to pay. -----Example----- Input 2 1 1 01000010 5 1 01101110 Output 2 6 -----Note----- In the second test case, if we place a mine under the fourth building and then activate it, then all mines on the field are activated. The cost of such operations is six, $b=1$ coin for placing a mine and $a=5$ coins for activating.
