 You are given two integers $n$ and $m$ and asked to find the maximum value of $f(s)$. Explanation: Given two integers $n$ and $m$, find the maximum value of $f(s)$. Constraints: $1 \leq n, m \leq 100$ 10^3 <= n, m <= 10^6 $s$ is binary string. $f(s)$ is the number of substrings in $s$ that contains at least one symbol, that
-----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line for each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{9}$, $0 \leq m \leq n$) — the length of the string and the number of symbols equal to "1" in it. -----Output----- For every test case print one integer number — the maximum value of $f(s)$ over all strings $s$ of length $n$, which has exactly $m$ symbols, equal to "1". -----Example----- Input 5 3 1 3 2 3 3 4 0 5 2 Output 4 5 6 0 12 -----Note----- In the first test case, there exists only $3$ strings of length $3$, which has exactly $1$ symbol, equal to "1". These strings are: $s_1 = $"100", $s_2 = $"010", $s_3 = $"001". The values of $f$ for them are: $f(s_1) = 3, f(s_2) = 4, f(s_3) = 3$, so the maximum value is $4$ and the answer is $4$. In the second test case, the string $s$ with the maximum value is "101". In the third test case, the string $s$ with the maximum value is "111". In the fourth test case, the only string $s$ of length $4$, which has exactly $0$ symbols, equal to "1" is "0000" and the value of $f$ for that string is $0$, so the answer is $0$. In the fifth test case, the string $s$ with the maximum value is "01010" and it is described as an example in the problem statement.
