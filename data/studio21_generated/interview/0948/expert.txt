 A function F(x, y) is a perfect square if F(x, y) = 2. Find the number of integral pairs (x, y) such that F(x, y) is a perfect square. 
-----Input----- First and the only line of the input contains two single space separated integers A and B. -----Output----- Output a single integer indicating the output to the only test case. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106 -----Example----- Input: 4 4 Output: 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. (1, 3) is the only pair such that x = 1, y = 3 satisfying x <= 4 and y <= 4. 1^2 + 3 = 4 which is a perfect square.
