 You are given an integer $n$. You are required to find the number of possible movements chef can make in $n$ rounds. 
Example, the path of Chef for $3^{rd}$ round is given below. $0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0$  The overall path followed by Chef would look somewhat like this: $0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 3 - â€¦$ You are given two non-negative integers $N$ and $K$. You have to tell the time at which Chef arrives at $x=N$ for the $K^{th}$ time.  Note - Chef can not skip a position while visiting the positions. -----Input:----- - The first line contains $T$ the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. - Each test case contains a single line of two integers $N$ and $K$. -----Output:----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer -- the time taken by the chef to arrive at $x=N$ for the $K^{th}$ time by modulo $1,000,000,007$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $0 \le N \le 10^9$ - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 5 0 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 4 6 -----Sample Output:----- 0 1 4 5 46 -----Explanation:----- Test Case 1: Chef starts the journey from the $N = 0$ at time $t = 0$ and it's the first time $(K = 1)$, he is here. So, the answer is $0$.   Test Case 2: Chef starts the journey from the $N = 0$ at time $t = 0$ then goes to $N = 1$ at $t = 1$ and it's the first time $(K = 1)$, he is here. So, the answer is $1$. Test Case 4: The path followed by Chef to reach $1$ for the third time is given below. $0 - 1 - 0 - 1 - 2 - 1$ He reaches $1$ for the third time at $t=5$.
