     You are given 2 integer arrays of length $N$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_N$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_N$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$,
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $D$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the smallest required number of days. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10$ - $1 \le N \le 10^4$ - $1 \le D \le 10^5$ - $1 \le a_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 10 1 10 20 30 40 50 60 90 80 100 1 5 2 9 80 27 72 79 -----Example Output----- 10 3 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: We do not need to worry about how the people are grouped, since only one person can be vaccinated in a single day. We require as many days as there are people. Example case 2: There are two people at risk and three people who are not at risk. One optimal strategy is to vaccinate the two people at risk on day $1$ and the remaining three on the next $2$ days.
