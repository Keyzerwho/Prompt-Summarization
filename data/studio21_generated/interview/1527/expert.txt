     Today is Chef's birthday. His mom decided to surprise him with a truly fantastic gift: his favourite binary string B. But, unfortunately, all the stocks of binary string B have been sold out, and only a binary string A (A   B) is available in the market. She purchases the string A and tries to convert it to string B by applying any of following three operations zero or more times. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 
-----Input----- First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case, will contain binary string A. Second line of each test case, will contain binary string B. -----Output----- For each test case, Print "Lucky Chef" (without quotes) in first line and minimum number of operations required to convert string A to sting B in second line if conversion is possible. Print "Unlucky Chef" (without quotes) in a new line otherwise. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ |A| ≤ 106 - 1 ≤ |B| ≤ 106 - A != B - |A| = |B| - sum of |A| over all test cases does not exceed 106 - sum of |B| over all test cases does not exceed 106 -----Subtasks----- -  Subtask #1 (40 points) : Sum of |A| & |B| over all test cases does not exceed 103 -  Subtask #2 (60 points) : Sum of |A| & |B| over all test cases does not exceed 106 -----Example----- Input 2 101 010 1111 1010 Output Lucky Chef 2 Unlucky Chef -----Explanation----- Example case 1. - Applying XOR operation with indices i = 1 and j = 2. Resulting string will be 011. - Then, Applying AND operation with indices i = 1 and j = 3. Resulting string will be 010. Example case 2. - It is impossible to convert string A to string B.
