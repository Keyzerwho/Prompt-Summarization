 You are given a list of commands and a number. Your task is to finish the Machine object. What the machine object must do is learn from its mistakes! The Machine will be given a command and a number you will return a random action. After the command has returned you will be given a response (true/false) if the response is true then you have done good, if the response is false then the action was a bad one. You must program the machine to learn to apply an action to a given command using the reponse given. Note: It must take no more than 20 times to teach an action to a command also different commands can have the same action.
