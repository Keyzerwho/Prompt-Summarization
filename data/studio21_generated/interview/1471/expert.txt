 You are asked to help Chef find the minimum number of moves that his two robots needed to be at the same cell and promises to give you a gift if he wins the competition. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. -  The first line of each test case contains 4 space-separated integers N M K1 K2 denoting the number of rows and columns in the table and the movable ranges of the first and second robot of Chef. -  The next N lines, each line contains M space-separated numbers either 0 or 1 denoting whether the robots can move to this cell or not (0 means robots can move to this cell, 1 otherwise). It makes sure that values in cell (1, 1) and cell (1, M) are 0. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of moves that Chef’s 2 robots needed to be at the same cell. If they can not be at the same cell, print -1. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100 - 0 ≤ K1, K2 ≤ 10 ----- Subtasks ----- Subtask #1 : (25 points)  -  K1 = K2 = 1  Subtask # 2 : (75 points)  Original Constraints -----Example----- Input: 2 4 4 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 Output: 5 -1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Robot 1 can move (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3), and robot 2 can move (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 3), they meet at cell (4, 3) after 5 moves. Example case 2. Because the movable range of both robots is 1, robot 1 can not move from (3, 1) to (4, 2), and robot 2 can not move from (3, 4) to (4, 3. Hence, they can not meet each other.
