 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A, you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant.
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows. - The first line of every testcase contains a single integer, $N$, which is the number of singers. - $N$ lines follow, the i-th of which contains two integers: $L_i$ and $U_i$, which correspond to the lower bound and upper bound of the i-th singer. -----Output----- For each testcase output a single line containing $N$ integers, the i-th of which should be score of the i-th singer at the end of the tournament.  -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 5$ - $2 \le N \le 10^5$ - $1 \le L_i < U_i \le 10^9$ - All the $2*N$ integers (lower bounds and upper bounds) are distinct. -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (15 points): $1 \le N \le 10^3$ Subtask #2 (25 points): - $1 \le N \le 10^5$ - It is guaranteed that no match ends in a draw. Subtask #3 (60 points): Original constraints. -----Sample Input----- 2 3 10 20 13 18 15 19 3 10 22 13 21 15 20 -----Sample Output----- 4 1 1 4 2 0 -----Explanation----- Testcase 1: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 20), (13, 18) and (15, 19). When the first singer and second singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}. Whereas the first singer can sing in the pitches {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}. So, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the second singer can, and also some other pitches. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The second singer gets no points from this match. When the first singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. So again, we see that the first singer can sing everything that the third singer can. Hence the first singer wins this match, and gets 2 points. The third singer gets no points from this match. When the second singer and third singer compete against each other in a match, we see that the second singer can sing in the pitches {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}, whereas the third singer can sing in the pitches {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}. In particular, the second singer can sing in the pitch 14, which the third singer cannot sing in. And the third singer can sing in the pitch 19, which the second singer cannot sing in. So neither of the two conditions are met, and hence this match ends in a draw. Both the second and third singer get 1 point each. Thus at the end of the tournament, the total score of first player is 2 + 2 = 4. Total score of the second player is 0 + 1 = 1. Total score of the third player is 0 + 1 = 1. Hence the output is 4 1 1 Testcase 2: There are three singers, with the lower bounds and upper bounds as (10, 22), (13, 21) and (15, 20). We see that the first singer wins against both second and third singers. And the second singer wins against the third singer. So the final total scores are (2 + 2), (0 + 2), (0 + 0), which is 4 2 0. Note that this would be a valid testcase in Subtask 2, because no match ends in a draw.
