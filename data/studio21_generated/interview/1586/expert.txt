 The score for such a table is defined as the sum of the maximum in each column. The first row is fixed. The second row can have 1, 2, ..., N numbers. Compute the score for each of the second rows.
-----Input format ----- The first line of the input has a single integer, N. The second line of the input has N integers, representing the first row, from left to right. -----Output format ----- The output should consist of a single line with N integers. For 1 ² k ² N, the kth number in the output should be the score when the second row of the table is taken to be k,k+1,...,N,1,...,k−1. -----Test Data ----- The testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs. • Subtask 1 [30 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 3000. • Subtask 2 [70 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 200000. In both the subtasks, all the integers in the first row of the table are between 1 and 100000, inclusive. -----Example ----- Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above. -----Sample input ----- 4 7 1 6 2 -----Sample output----- 9 10 10 11 Note: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format. Please remove all diagnostic print statements before making your final submission. A program with extraneous output will be treated as incorrect!
