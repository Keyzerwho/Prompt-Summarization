 You are given a number $X$ and a number $Y$. You need to find the number of moves required to catch it. 
-----Input:----- -  The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. -  Each test case consists of 3 space-separated integers $H$, $X$ and $Y$. -----Output:----- - For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of moves required to catch the pokemon if it is possible to catch it else print -1. -----Constraints----- -  1 <= $T$ <= 103 -  1 <=  $X$, $Y$ < $H$ <= 109 -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): - 1 <=  $X$, $Y$ < $H$ <= 1000 Subtask #2 (70 points): - Original Constraints -----Sample Input:----- 2 101 10 10 11 3 3   -----Sample Output:----- 6 -1   -----EXPLANATION:----- -  Example Case 1: Ash can make use of Grow once. So $X$ = 10 + 10 = 20 Then he can do Tackle 5 times to decrease $H$ to 1. OR Ash can make use of Grow 4 times. So $X$ = 10 + 4*10 = 50 Then he can do Tackle 2 times to decrease $H$ to 1. Hence, a total of 6 moves are required either way which is minimum.   -  Example Case 2: No matter how many times Ash uses Grow or Tackle, pokemon can never be caught.
