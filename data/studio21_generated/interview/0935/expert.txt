 You are given a positive integer $X$. You are supposed to find the number of turns necessary to make $X$ divisible by $10$. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer denoting the initial value of $X$.  -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of turns or $-1$ if there is no way to win the game. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 1000$ - $0 \le X \le 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 10 25 1 -----Example Output----- 0 1 -1
