 Given the maximum number of digits (`max_digits`), how many positive integers in the range are either increasing or decreasing (or both)  Since your answer will be very large, please give your answer modulo 12345787. Also note that, unlike Giacomo's version, the number zero is excluded from the counts (because it's not positive).
Examples ```python # Up to two digits, all numbers are either increasing or decreasing insane_inc_or_dec(1) == 9 insane_inc_or_dec(2) == 99 insane_inc_or_dec(3) == 474 insane_inc_or_dec(4) == 1674 insane_inc_or_dec(5) == 4953 insane_inc_or_dec(6) == 12951 ``` # Acknowledgement This problem was inspired by [Project Euler #113: Non-bouncy Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=113).
