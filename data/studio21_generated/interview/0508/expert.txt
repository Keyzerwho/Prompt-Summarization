 You are given two integers N and Q. For each roadwork, there are 1 to 2 people standing there. You need to find the distance each person will walk. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N Q S_1 T_1 X_1 : S_N T_N X_N D_1 : D_Q -----Output----- Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever. -----Sample Input----- 4 6 1 3 2 7 13 10 18 20 13 3 4 2 0 1 2 3 5 8 -----Sample Output----- 2 2 10 -1 13 -1 The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2. The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2. The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.
