 You are given an array $a$ containing integer numbers $a[i]$, where $i=1,2,\dots,n$. The array $a$ denotes the size of the ith box. Since Rohit has a tiny room, there is a shortage of space. Therefore, he has to reduce the number of boxes on the ground by putting a box into another box that is at least twice the size of the current box i.e if we have to put the ith box into the jth box then $( 2*a[i] ) <= a[j]$. Each box can contain a maximum of one box and the box which is kept in another box cannot
-----Input:----- - The first line contains a single integer n. - The next n lines contain the integer a[i] - the size of the i-th box. -----Output:----- Output a single integer denoting the minimum number of boxes remaining on the ground. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq n \leq 5*10^5$ - $1 \leq a[i] \leq 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- - 30 points : $1 \leq n \leq 10^2$ - 70 points : $1 \leq n \leq 5*10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 5 16 1 4 8 2 -----Sample Output:----- 3
