 You are given $n$ words. Each word contains only letters A and B. You need to count how many words are bubbly. 
-----Input----- -  			The first line of input contains the positive integer M, the number of words written down by Nikki. 				 -  			Each of the following M lines contains a single word consisting of letters A and B, with length 			between 2 and 10^5, inclusive. The sum of lengths of all words doesn't exceed 10^6. 				 -----Output----- 			The first and only line of output must contain the number of bubbly words. 		 -----Constraints----- -  			1 ≤ M ≤ 100 				 -----Sample Input----- 3 ABAB AABB ABBA -----Sample Output----- 2 -----Explanation----- -  					 ABAB - It is not bubbly as A(indexed 1) will connect to A(indexed 3) by a line and when we try to connect B(indexed 2) with B(indexed 4) by a line then it will intersect with the line b/w A and A. 				 -  					AABB - It is bubbly as line b/w A and A will not intersect with the line b/w B and B. 			 -  ABBA -It is also bubbly as lines will not intersect. We can draw line b/w A and A above the line b/w B and B. 				 p { text-align:justify }
