 You are given two containers of milk. One is a cone with radius r1 and height h1. The other is a cylindrical with radius r2 and height h2. Pankaj wants to know the amount (volume) of ice cream in both of the containers.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. - Each test case consists of a single line having the r1, h1, r2 and h2. Each value is given upto 2 decimal places. See example for more information. -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single line containing the volumes of the two containers separated by space. The answer is considered correct if it is correct upto 6 decimal places. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 0 <  r1, h1, r2, h2 ≤ 100 -----Example----- Input: 2 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 3.02 7.23 5.20 6.00 Output: 3.141592654 3.141592654 126.739919445 509.691992118
