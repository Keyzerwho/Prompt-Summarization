 You are given the chessboard of N*M. You are given the coin on square (1, 1). You are given the set of rules. You are given the power. You are given the number of games K. Calculate the probability that Yoda will teach Chef.
-----Input----- Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases Each test case begins with 4 integers N, M, P, K. -----Output----- For each test case, output a line containing the answer for task. The output must have an absolute error at most 0.000001 (10-6).   -----Constraints and Subtasks----- -  1 ≤ T ≤ 50  -  1 ≤ K  Subtask 1 : 10 points  -  2 ≤ N, M ≤ 5  -  0 ≤ P ≤ K ≤ 5  Subtusk 2 : 10 points  -  2 ≤ N, M ≤ 10  -  0 ≤ P ≤ K ≤ 10^3  Subtusk 3 : 20 points  -  2 ≤ N, M ≤ 100  -  0 ≤ P ≤ K ≤ 10^3  Subtusk 4 : 60 points -  2 ≤ N, M ≤ 100  -  0 ≤ P ≤ K ≤ 10^6  -----Example----- Input: 2 2 3 2 3 2 2 5 5 Output: 0.500000 1.000000
