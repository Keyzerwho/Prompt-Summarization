 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to find all possible movements of the thief in Tablecity such that every hour he will get fully investigated. 
-----Input----- There is no input for this problem.  -----Output----- The first line of output contains integer N – duration of police search in hours. Each of the following N lines contains exactly 4 integers X_{i}1, Y_{i}1, X_{i}2, Y_{i}2 separated by spaces, that represent 2 districts (X_{i}1, Y_{i}1), (X_{i}2, Y_{i}2) which got investigated during i-th hour. Output is given in chronological order (i-th line contains districts investigated during i-th hour) and should guarantee that the thief is caught in no more than 2015 hours, regardless of thief’s initial position and movement.  N ≤ 2015  1 ≤ X ≤ 1000  1 ≤ Y ≤ 2  -----Examples----- Input В этой задаче нет примеров ввода-вывода. This problem doesn't have sample input and output. Output Смотрите замечание ниже. See the note below. -----Note----- Let's consider the following output: 2 5 1 50 2 8 1 80 2 This output is not guaranteed to catch the thief and is not correct. It is given to you only to show the expected output format. There exists a combination of an initial position and a movement strategy such that the police will not catch the thief. Consider the following initial position and thief’s movement: In the first hour, the thief is located in district (1,1). Police officers will search districts (5,1) and (50,2) and will not find him. At the start of the second hour, the thief moves to district (2,2). Police officers will search districts (8,1) and (80,2) and will not find him. Since there is no further investigation by the police, the thief escaped!
