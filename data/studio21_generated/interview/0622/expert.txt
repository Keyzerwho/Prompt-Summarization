 You are given a string $S$ with length $N$; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ determines the type of the $i$-th operation: - 'R': Pick up the paper from the right side and fold it onto the left side. - 'L': Pick up the paper from the left side and fold it onto the right side. - 'U': Pick up the paper from the upper side and fold it onto the bottom side. - 'D': Pick up the paper from the bottom side and fold it onto the upper side. The paper is folded in such a way that there is still a flat
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $M$, $W$ and $H$. - The second line contains a single string $S$. - Each of the following $M$ lines contains two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ denoting the coordinates of one point. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one real number â€• the minimum distance. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 50$ - $2 \le M \le 1,000$ - $1 \le N \le 1,000$ - $3 \le W, H \le 10^9$ - $1 \le X \le W-1$ - $1 \le Y \le H-1$ - the points are pairwise distinct -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (50 points): all characters of $S$ are 'U' Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 6 2 10 10 ULRDDL 4 4 5 5 4 2 10 10 RUDL 1 1 9 9 -----Example Output----- 1.41421356237 2.00000000000
