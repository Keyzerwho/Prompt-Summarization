 The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence  It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $S$ modulo $10^9+7$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $1 \le L \le R \le 10^{10}$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (50 points): - $T \le 10^2$ - $R \le 10^9$ Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 1 5 2 4 100 100 -----Example Output----- 27 17 441 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: $1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 27$ Example case 2: $2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 17$ Example case 3: $21^2 = 441$
