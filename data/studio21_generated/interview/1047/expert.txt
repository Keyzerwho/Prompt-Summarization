 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A, you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one real number â€” the minimum distance $a$ multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $2 \le N \le 10^4$ - $|X_i|, |Y_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (10 points): - $1 \le T \le 10$ - $2 \le N \le 5$ - $|X_i|, |Y_i| \le 10$ for each valid $i$ - $a \cdot \sqrt{2}$ is an integer Subtask #2 (90 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 3 0 0 0 1 0 -1 3 0 1 1 0 -1 0 -----Example Output----- 0.5 0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: We should build roads described by equations $y-x+0.5 = 0$ and $y-x-0.5 = 0$. Example case 2: We should build roads described by equations $y-x-1 = 0$ and $y+x-1 = 0$.
