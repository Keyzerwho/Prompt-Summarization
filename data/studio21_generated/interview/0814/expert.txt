 You are given a strip of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$). The cells can be blocked or free. If cell $i$ is blocked, player A can not move to cell $i$. Player A plays first. Player A can move to any free cell. Player A can move to cell $i-1$ or $i+1$ (if cell $i$ is free). If player A can not move to a free cell, she loses the game.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Nayeon wins the game or "No" if Tzuyu wins (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 40,000$ - $2 \le N \le 3\cdot 10^5$ - $0 \le A_i \le 1$ for each valid $i$ - $A_1 = A_N = 1$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (50 points): $A_i = 0$ for each $i$ ($2 \le i \le N-1$) Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 4 7 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 8 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 4 1 1 0 1 4 1 1 1 1 -----Example Output----- Yes No Yes No -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Since both Nayeon and Tzuyu play optimally, Nayeon can start e.g. by moving to cell $4$, which then becomes blocked. Tzuyu has to pick either the cell $3$ or the cell $5$, which also becomes blocked. Nayeon is then left with only one empty cell next to cell $4$ (the one Tzuyu did not pick); after she moves there, Tzuyu is unable to move, so she loses the game. Example case 2: Regardless of what cell Nayeon moves to at the start, Tzuyu will always be able to beat her.
