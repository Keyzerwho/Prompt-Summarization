 Given an integer num, find the closest two integers in absolute difference whose product equals num + 1 or num + 2. Return the two integers in any order.   Example 1: Input: num = 8 Output: [3,3] Explanation: For num + 1 = 9, the closest divisors are 3 & 3, for num + 2 = 10, the closest divisors are 2 & 5, hence 3 & 3 is chosen. Example 2: Input
