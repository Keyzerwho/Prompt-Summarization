 The forest department has collected data on each tree and knows the volume of wood (in cubic feet) available in each tree in the forest. The forest department maintains this information in the form of an $M \times N$ array of integers, where the $(i, j)$th entry is the volume, in cubic feet, of the $i^{th}$ tree on the $i^{th}$ row (or, equivalently, the $i^{th}$ tree on the $i^{th}$ column).  We assume that our rows are numbered top to bottom and the columns are numbered from left to right. 
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains two integers $M$ and $N$ indicating the number of rows and columns of trees in the forest.  - The following $M$ lines have $N$ integers each. The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i+1$ denotes the volume (in cubic feet) of the $j^{th}$  tree on the $i^{th}$  row.  - Line $M+2$ contains a single integer $C$ indicating the number of rectangles for which the total volume is to be computed.  - Each of the following $C$ lines (line $M+2+1 ... M+2+C$) contain four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2$ and $y_2$ (with $x_1 \leq x_2$ and $y_1 \leq y_2$) and describes a rectangle. The rectangle has its top left corner at the tree in position $(x_1,y_1)$ and its bottom right corner at the tree at position $(x_2,y_2)$. -----Output:----- Your output must contain $C$ lines with one integer on each line. Line $i$ must contain the total volume of wood in the rectangle described on line $M+2+i$ in the input. -----Constraints----- - In $30 \%$ of inputs, $1 \leq C \leq 100$. - In all inputs, $2 \leq N, M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq C \leq 1000000$ - $0 \leq$ volume of wood in each tree $\leq 1000$ - $1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq M$ - $1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq N$ -----Sample Input----- 4 4  3 4 15 23  14 20 12 9 3 8 12 15 12 20 7 5 2 2 2 3 4  4 2 4 2 -----Sample Output----- 76 20
