 You are given a list of strings, you need to output a sorted list of strings. Comparison should be case sensitive.
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer, R, which denotes the number of reports to be checked. The description of each report follows after this. - The first line of each report contains a single integer, L, the length of that report. - The second line of each report contains a string of length L. The string contains only the characters '.', 'H', and 'T'. -----Output----- - For each report, output the string "Valid" or "Invalid" in a new line, depending on whether it was a valid report or not. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ R ≤ 500 - 1 ≤ length of each report ≤ 500 -----Example----- Input: 6 18 ..H..T...HTH....T. 3 ... 10 H..H..T..T 2 HT 11 .T...H..H.T 7 H..T..H Output: Valid Valid Invalid Valid Invalid Invalid -----Explanation----- "H..H..T..T" is invalid because the second snake starts before the first snake ends, which is not allowed. ".T...H..H.T" is invalid because it has a 'T' before a 'H'. A tail can come only after its head. "H..T..H" is invalid because the last 'H' does not have a corresponding 'T'.
