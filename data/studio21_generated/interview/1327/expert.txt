 You are given two cities $x$ and $y$, and you need to find the minimum cost of a simple path from city $x$ to city $y$. Then, you need to find the length of the longest simple path from $x$ to $y$ with this cost. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N$. - The following $Q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$. -----Output----- For each query, print a single line containing two space-separated integers â€• the minimum cost and the maximum length. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N, Q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ - $0 \le v_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \le x, y \le N$ - the sum of $N$ in all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ - the sum of $Q$ in all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): - $1 \le N, Q \le 1,000$ - $v_1 < v_2 < \ldots < v_N$ - the sum of $N$ in all test cases does not exceed $5,000$ - the sum of $Q$ in all test cases does not exceed $5,000$ Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 4 2 4 2 5 7 2 3 3 4 2 1 1 1 2 1 -----Example Output----- 4 3 3 2 -1 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: For the first query, there are two paths with cost $4$ from city $2$ to city $3$: - $2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$: cost $(|4-2|+1-2)+(|5-4|+3-1) = 4$, length $3$ - $2 \rightarrow 3$: cost $|5-2|+3-2 = 4$, length $2$ All other paths have greater costs, so the minimum cost is $4$. Among these two paths, we want the one with greater length, which is $3$.
