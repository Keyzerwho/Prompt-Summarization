 A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns. The graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph. Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a Hole at node 0. During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are.  For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1]. Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat
Example 1: Input: [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]] Output: 0 Explanation: 4---3---1 |   | 2---5  \ /   0   Note: 3 <= graph.length <= 50 It is guaranteed that graph[1] is non-empty. It is guaranteed that graph[2] contains a non-zero element.
