 You are given string $S$ and integer $L$. A operation is described as :- "You are allowed to pick any substring from first $L$ characters of $S$, and place it at the end of the string $S$.  A string $A$ is a substring of an string $B$ if $A$ can be obtained from $B$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Find the shortest string after performing this operation any number of times 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.  - Then each of the N lines contain an integer $L$ and a string $S$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer lexographically smallest string. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$ - $2 \leq |S| \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq L \leq N $ -----Sample Input:----- 2 1 rga 2 cab -----Sample Output:----- arg abc -----EXPLANATION:----- In the first testcase: substring 'r' is picked and placed at the end of the string. rga -> gar Then performing same operation gives :- gar -> arg
