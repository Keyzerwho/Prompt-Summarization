 You are given a rectangular area. You have to divide it into minimum possible number of square plots such that the area of each plot is the same. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains $T$, the number of test cases. Then $T$ lines follow. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, $N$ and $M$, the length and the breadth of the land, respectively. -----Output----- For each test case, print the minimum number of square plots with equal area, such that they divide the farm land perfectly, in a new line. -----Constraints----- $1 \le T \le 20$ $1 \le M \le 10000$ $1 \le N \le 10000$  -----Sample Input:----- 2 10 15 4 6 -----SampleOutput:----- 6 6
