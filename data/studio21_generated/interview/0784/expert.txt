 You have matrix $A$ consisting of n rows, each contains m elements. Initially, the element aij of matrix equals j. (1   i   n, 1   j   m).  Then p times some element aij is increased by 1.  Then Chef needs to calculate the following:  - For each row he tries to move from the last element (with number m) to the first one (with the number 1).  - While staying in aij Chef can only move to aij - 1
-----Input----- - The first line contains three integers n, m and p denoting the number of rows, the number of elements a single row and the number of increasing commands.  - Each of next p lines contains two integers i and j denoting that the element aij  is increased by one.  -----Output----- - For each row in a single line print the answer after the P increasing commands. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ n, m, p ≤ 10 ^ 5 - 1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1 ≤ j ≤ m -----Example----- Input: 4 4 6 2 2 3 2  3 2  4 3 4 4 4 3 Output: 3 3 -1 4 -----Explanation----- Here is the whole matrix after P commands: 1 2 3 4 1 3 3 4 1 4 3 4 1 2 5 5 Explanations to the answer:  - The first line is without changes: 4-3=1, 3-2=1, 2-1=1. answer = 3.  - The second line: 4-3=1, 3-3=0, 3-1=2. The answer is 3.  - The third line: 4-3=1, 3-4=-1, Chef can't move to the first number here. Therefore, the answer is -1.  - The fourth line: 5-5=0, 5-2=3, 2-1=1. The answer is 4.
