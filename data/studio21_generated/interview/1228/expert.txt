 You are given N points. Find the missing one. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - Then, $4N-1$ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $y$ denoting a vertex $(x, y)$ of some rectangle. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ â€• the coordinates of the missing point. It can be proved that the missing point can be determined uniquely. -----Constraints----- - $T \le 100$ - $1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$ - $|x|, |y| \le 10^9$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): - $T = 5$ - $N \le 20$ Subtask #2 (30 points): $|x|, |y| \le 10^5$ Subtask #3 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 2 1 1 1 2 4 6 2 1 9 6 9 3 4 3 -----Example Output----- 2 2 -----Explanation----- The original set of points are: Upon adding the missing point $(2, 2)$, $N = 2$ rectangles can be formed:
