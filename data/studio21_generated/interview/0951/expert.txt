 You are given a list of buildings. The buildings are numbered 1 to n. Each building is described by its x-coordinate and y-coordinate. The building has value between 0 and 10000. The length of a wall is the distance between the two ends of the wall. You are given a list of integers (x, y, v, l). You need to find a subset of buildings such that, using the bricks from the buildings from that subset, the remaining buildings can be enclosed in a single boundary. Find the minimum value. If more than one such minimum-value subset exists, choose one with the smallest number of buildings.
