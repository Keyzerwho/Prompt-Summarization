 You are given two strings $s$ and $t$. Find the length of the shortest string $s^*$ such that $s^*$ contains exactly the given number of  XD  subsequences. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. - Next T lines contains a single integer N, the no of seconds laughed. -----Output----- -  For each input, print the corresponding string having minimum length. If there are multiple possible answers, print any. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 109 - 1 ≤ Sum of length of output over all testcases ≤ 5*105 -----Example----- Input: 1 9 Output: XXXDDD -----Explanation----- Some of the possible strings are - XXDDDXD,XXXDDD,XDXXXDD,XDXDXDD etc. Of these, XXXDDD is the smallest.
