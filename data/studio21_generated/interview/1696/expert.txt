 You are given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive). Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 
-----Input----- Same as for the easy and medium versions. But remember that now 1 ≤ P ≤ 1000 and that the marmots may provide positive as well as negative integers. -----Output----- Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The village's line shall state poisson if the village's distribution is of the Poisson type, and uniform if the answers came from a uniform distribution.
