 You are given four integers $S, K, m, M$. Lima asks you to find the smallest counterexample to Fulu's program. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $S$, $K$, $m$ and $M$. -----Output----- For each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer $-1$; otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers â€” the lexicographically smallest proper sequence. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 8$ - $3 \le N \le 10^5$ - $1 \le K \le N-1$ - $1 \le S \le 10^9$ - $1 \le m \le M \le S$ -----Example Input----- 2 3 6 1 1 5 4 4 2 1 3 -----Example Output----- 1 1 4 -1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: For the sequence $A = [1, 1, 4]$, it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements ($K=1$, $N\%K=0$) and return the only remaining element $4$. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is $1$. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence. Example case 2: The only possible sequence is $A = [1, 1, 1, 1]$, which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer $1$ for it.
