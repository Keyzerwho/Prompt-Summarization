 You are given N coordinates on the xy-plane. A given compass can point to (p,q) or (p,r) when d(p,q) = d(p,r) where d is the Manhattan distance. Initially, you are at (a,b) coordinates. You need to find the number of pairs of coordinates such that the compass can point. -----Constraints-----  - 2 N 10^5  - 1 x_i, y_i 10^9
-----Input:----- - The first line consists of a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. - The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers which represents $N$ and $X$ for that test case respectively. - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers, $i^{th}$ of which represents $a[i]$. -----Output:----- For each test case, print in a single line, $YES$ if Jenish can escape or $NO$ if he gets destroyed. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq  X \leq 10^9$ - $0 \leq a[i] \leq 10^6$ - $ 1 \leq N \leq 10^5$ - $\Sigma$ $N$ over all the test cases does not exceed $10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 4 8 5 1 4 2 3 4 3 1 2 2 7 5 5 -----Sample Output:----- YES YES NO -----Explanation----- For test $1$, in the 1st second, first Jenish will select battery at index $1$ and then the tanks from either side will move one meter closer, thus destroying the battery at index $4$.Then, in the next second, Jenish will select battery at index $3$.Then,tanks will move one meter closer again to destroy the remaining battery at index $2$.But now, Jenish has a total energy of $9$ units which is more than enough to destroy the tanks. For test $2$, Jenish can use batteries at index $1$ and $2$ to get a total energy of $4$ units. For test $3$, Jenish can use batteries at index $1$ or $2$ and get a maximum of $5$ units of energy which is less than required.
