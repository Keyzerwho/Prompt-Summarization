 Create a class called `Warrior` which calculates and keeps track of their level and skills, and ranks them as the warrior they've proven to be. Business Rules: - A warrior starts at level 1 and can progress all the way to 100. - A warrior starts at rank `"Pushover"` and can progress all the way to `"Greatest"`. - The only acceptable range of rank values is `"Pushover", "Novice", "Fighter", "Warrior", "Veteran", "Sage", "Elite", "Conquer
Examples: - If a warrior level 1 fights an enemy level 1, they will receive 10 experience points. - If a warrior level 1 fights an enemy level 3, they will receive 80 experience points. - If a warrior level 5 fights an enemy level 4, they will receive 5 experience points. - If a warrior level 3 fights an enemy level 9, they will receive 720 experience points, resulting in the warrior rising up by at least 7 levels. - If a warrior level 8 fights an enemy level 13, they will receive 0 experience points and return `"You've been defeated"`. (Remember, difference in rank & enemy level being 5 levels higher or more must be established for this.) - If a warrior level 6 fights an enemy level 2, they will receive 0 experience points.  Training Rules & Calculations: - In addition to earning experience point from battles, warriors can also gain experience points from training. - Training will accept an array of three elements (except in java where you'll get 3 separated arguments): the description, the experience points your warrior earns, and the minimum level requirement. - If the warrior's level meets the minimum level requirement, the warrior will receive the experience points from it and store the description of the training. It should end up returning that description as well. - If the warrior's level does not meet the minimum level requirement, the warrior doesn not receive the experience points and description and instead returns `"Not strong enough"`, without any archiving of the result.  Code Examples: ```python bruce_lee = Warrior() bruce_lee.level         # => 1 bruce_lee.experience    # => 100 bruce_lee.rank          # => "Pushover" bruce_lee.achievements  # => [] bruce_lee.training(["Defeated Chuck Norris", 9000, 1]) # => "Defeated Chuck Norris" bruce_lee.experience    # => 9100 bruce_lee.level         # => 91 bruce_lee.rank          # => "Master" bruce_lee.battle(90)    # => "A good fight" bruce_lee.experience    # => 9105 bruce_lee.achievements  # => ["Defeated Chuck Norris"] ```
