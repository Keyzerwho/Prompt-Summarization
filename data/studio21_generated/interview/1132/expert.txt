 You are given $N$ pairs of parenthesis ( )  by your teacher who gave you a difficult task.The task consists of two steps. First,Shaun should colour all $N$ pairs of parenthesis each with different color but opening and closing bracket of a particular pair should be of same colour. Then,Shaun should report to his teacher the number of ways he can arrange all $2*N$ brackets such that sequence form is valid. Teacher defined valid sequence by these rules: - Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'. - Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Shaun to his teacher modulo 1000000007. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 1 2 3 -----Sample Output:----- 1 6 90 -----EXPLANATION:----- Here numbers from $1$ to $N$ have been used to denote parenthesis.A unique number corresponds to a unique pair of parenthesis. -In the first test case , you can use only one color to color the parenthesis  you could arrange it only in one way i.e, 1 1 -In the second test case  you can use two colors and the possible ways of arranging it are 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1
