 You are given Chefgram 's filters. Chef can apply as many filters as he wants from a list. He can pick any subset of filters and consequently apply them to a photo. For example: - Imagine that Chef has a photo "bbwwbbwwbb" (where 'b' stands for black and 'w' stands for white). - He applies filters "++--++--++", "-+-+-+-+-+". - Applying the first filter will transform his picture to "wwwwwwwwww".  - Applying the second filter on the transformed
-----Input----- - The first line of input contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. - First line of each test case contains a string S. Each symbol is either 'b' or 'w'. This is Chef's photo. - Second line of each test case contains a single integer N — the number of Chefgram™ filters. - Each of the next N lines contains a single string Fi, each symbol of which is either '+' or '-'. This string is the ith Chefgram™ filter. -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer — answer to Chef's question modulo 109+7. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 5 - |S| = 10 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 - |Fi| = 10 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1: T ≤ 5; N ≤ 20; Points: 20 - Subtask 2: T ≤ 5; N ≤ 10^3; Points: 30 - Subtask 3: T ≤ 5; N ≤ 10^5; Points: 50 -----Example----- Input: 3 wwwwwwwwww 3 +-+-+-+-+- ---------- +--------- wbwbwbwbwb 3 +-+-+-+-+- +-+------- ----+-+-+- bbbbbbbbbb 2 ---------- ---------- Output: 0 2 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. There is no filter or combination of filters transforming the picture to whole black.  Example case 2. Chef can either apply the first filter (and invert all whites) or apply the second and third filters in any order. Example case 3. Picture is already fully black, and we have two different identity filters. Chef can either apply the empty subset of filters, the first filter only, the second filter only, or both.
