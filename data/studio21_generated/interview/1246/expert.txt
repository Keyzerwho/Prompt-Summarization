 You are given two starting points $A$ and $B$, where $A$ and $B$ are opposite ends of a diameter. Walter and Jesse have divided themselves in $2$ teams with $N$ teammates in each team. This race has two commencing points $A$ and $B$ strictly facing each other. Walter and his team commences from $A$ point and other team starts from $B$. Both the teams start running at the same time clockwise around the globe. Speed of every player is constant throughout the race. If a player has a speed $X$ then it means that
-----Input:------ - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.  - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ number of teammates in both team. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2 \ldots A_N$ denoting speed of A's Team - The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers  $B_1, B_2 \ldots B_N$ denoting speed of B's Team -----Output:------ For each test case, print a single line denoting YES if the race ends at any point of time else NO -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$ - $0 \leq A_i \leq 2^{15}$ - $0 \leq B_i \leq 2^{15}$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points):  - $1 \le N \le 20$ - $0 \le  A_i  \le 11$ - $0 \le  B_i  \le 11$ Subtask #2 (70 points):  - Original constraints -----Sample input:----- 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 2 7 8 9 9 -----Sample output----- YES -----Sample Explanation:------ Team B can overtake all members of Team A.
