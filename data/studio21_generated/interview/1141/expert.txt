 You are given a Bytelandian alphabet. Your task is to write a program, which given input string and Bytelandian alphabet, return output string, such that given input string is translated to output string. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting the English translation of Bytelandian string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". T and M are separated by exactly one space. Then T lines follow, each containing a Bytelandian sentence S which you should translate into English. See constraints for details. -----Output----- For each of the sentence in the input, output its English translation on a separate line. Replace each underscores ('_') with a space (' ') in the output. Each punctuation symbol (see below) should remain the same. Note that the uppercase letters in Bytelandian remain uppercase in English, and lowercase letters remain lowercase. See the example and its explanation for clarity. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - M is a permutation of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" - Each sentence is non-empty and contains at most 100 characters - Each sentence may contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), uppercase letters ('A'-'Z'), underscores ('_') and punctuation symbols: dot ('.'), comma (','), exclamation ('!'), question-mark('?') -----Example----- Input: 5 qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm Ph Pcssi Bpke_kdc_epclc_jcijsc_mihyo? Epcf_kdc_liswhyo_EIED_hy_Vimcvpcn_Zkdvp_siyo_viyecle. Ipp! Output: Hi Hello What are these people doing? They are solving TOTR in Codechef March long contest. Ohh! -----Explanation----- The string "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm" means that 'a' in Bytelandian is 'q' in English, 'b' in Bytelandian is 'w' in English, 'c' in Bytelandian is 'e' in English and so on. Thus to translate "Ph" (first sentence in example) to English: 1) We find that 'p' in Bytelandian means 'h' in English. So we replace 'P' with 'H'. 2) Then we see that 'h' in Bytelandian means 'i' in English. So we replace 'h' with 'i'. 3) Therefore, the translation is "Hi".
