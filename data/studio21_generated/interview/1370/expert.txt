 You are given three-digit numbers as input. You need to find the number of distinct three-digit numbers which the device outputs. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $K, N$. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct 3-digit numbers which the device outputs over the $N$ steps. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$  - $5 \leq N \leq 10^9$  - Each digit of $K$ is non-zero            -----Sample Input:----- 1 123 5          -----Sample Output:----- 27
