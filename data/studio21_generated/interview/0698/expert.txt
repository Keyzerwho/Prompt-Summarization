 You are given two numbers  A  and  B . Passcode is the number of  X  such that 0   X < B and gcd(A,B) = gcd(A+X,B). Note : gcd(A,B) is the greatest common divisor of A & B. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the single integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 50) — the number of test cases. Next T lines contain test cases per line. Each line contains two integers  A  &  B  ( 1 ≤ A < B ≤ 1010 ) -----Output----- Print T integers, one for each Test case. For each test case print the appropriate passcode for that day. -----Sample Input----- 3 4 9 5 10 42 9999999967 -----Output----- 6 1 9999999966
