 You are given a string H, which consists only of symbols 'a' and 'b'. Harrenhal is completely ruined if and only if the length of H is equal to zero. So, how to make H empty  Send a military troop! When a military troop of the king reach the castle, they delete some palindromic subsequence S of H. For example, let H = 'abbabaab'. Then the current military troop can choose S = 'ababa'(Let's make symbols of S bold in H: 'abbabaab'). After deleting S, H will be equal to 'bab
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines contain a string H each, denoting the string, that describes the current state of Harrenhal for the corresponding test cases. It's guaranteed, that each H consists only of symbols 'a' and 'b'. -----Output----- The output should contain exactly T lines. i'th line of the output should contain the only integer: the minimal number of military troops, that the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms has to send in order to ruin Harrenhal for the corresponding test cases. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ |H| ≤ 100000, for each H. - Subtask 1(30 points): each H in the input is a palindrome, 1 ≤ T ≤ 6; - Subtask 2(70 points): 1 ≤ T ≤ 9. -----Example----- Input: 1 abbabaab Output: 2 -----Explanation----- There're multiple ways to ruin Harrenhal in the example test. Let's consider one of them. The first troop can delete S = 'ababa'('abbabaab'). After that, H = 'bab'. The second troop can delete S = 'bab'('bab'). After that, H is empty and that's it.
