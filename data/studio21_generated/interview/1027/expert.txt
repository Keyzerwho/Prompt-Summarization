 You are given N, P, and a string. Return a string that Chef likes  If it's impossible to do so, output "impossible" (without quotes) 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, P. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the answer of the problem, i.e. the valid string if it exists otherwise "impossible"  (without quotes). If there are more than possible answers, you can output any. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ P, N ≤ 105 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1 (25 points) : P = N - Subtask #2 (75 points) : No additional constraints -----Example----- Input 5 3 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 6 3 Output impossible impossible aba abba abaaba -----Explanation----- Example 1: The only strings possible are either aaa or bbb, which Chef doesn't like. So, the answer is impossible. Example 2: There are four possible strings, aa, ab, ba, bb. Only aa and bb are palindromic, but Chef doesn't like these strings. Hence, the answer is impossible. Example 4: The string abba is a palindrome and has a period of 4. Example 5: The string abaaba is a palindrome and has a period of length 3.
