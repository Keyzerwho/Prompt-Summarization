 Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once). After this process, we have some array B. Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.   Example 1: Input: A = [1], K = 0 Output: 0 Explanation: B = [1] Example 2: Input: A = [0,10], K = 2 Output: 6
