 You are given a string $S$ with length $D$ describing the lessons Chef attended   for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is either 'A' if Chef was absent on day $i$ or 'P' if Chef was actually present on day $i$. For each day $d$ when Chef is absent, one of Chef's friends can mark him as present by proxy on this day only if he was present (if he was really present, not just marked as present) on at least one of the previous two days, i.e. days $d-1$ and $d-
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $D$. - The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $D$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of times Chef needs to be marked as present by proxy, or $-1$ if it is impossible to make Chef achieve 75% attendance. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 200$ - $1 \le D \le 1,000$ - $S$ contains only characters 'A' and 'P' -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 9 PAAPPAPPP -----Example Output----- 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: With a proxy on the third day, the attendance string is "PAPPPAPPP". Now, Chef's attendance is at least 75%, so the minimum number of times Chef needs to be marked as present by proxy is $1$.
