     You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$,
-----Input----- The first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct. The third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file. Next line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef. Each of the next T lines contains positive integer K followed by K strings, names of cities of the current route. Cities are given in order in which Chef will visit them during his travel. All strings in the input file composed only of lowercase, uppercase letters of the English alphabet and hyphens. Each string is non-empty and has length at most 20. If some line of the input file contains more then one element than consecutive elements of this line are separated by exactly one space. Each line of the input file has no leading or trailing spaces. -----Output----- For each travel route from the input file output a single line containing word ERROR if the route is incorrect and its length otherwise. -----Constraints----- 1 <= N <= 50 0 <= M <= N * (N - 1) 1 <= D <= 20000 1 <= T <= 50 1 <= K <= 50 1 <= length of each string <= 20 -----Example----- Input: 5 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood 9 Donetsk Kiev 560 Kiev New-York 7507 New-York Miami 1764 Miami Hollywood 28 Hollywood Miami 30 Miami New-York 1764 Kiev Donetsk 550 Hollywood New-York 1736 New-York Hollywood 1738 13 5 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood 5 Hollywood Miami New-York Kiev Donetsk 3 Donetsk Kiev Donetsk 2 Kyiv New-York 3 New-York Hollywood Miami 2 New-York Miami 3 Hollywood New-York Miami 4 Donetsk Kiev Miami Hollywood 2 Donetsk Hollywood 1 Donetsk 2 Mumbai Deli 6 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood New-York 2 Miami Miami Output: 9859 ERROR ERROR ERROR 1768 1764 3500 ERROR ERROR 0 ERROR ERROR ERROR -----Explanation----- The 2nd route is incorrect since there is no road from New-York to Kiev. Note however that inverse road from Kiev to New-York exists.  The 3rd route is incorrect since the first city coincides with the last one.  The 4th route is incorrect since there is no city with name Kyiv (Probably Chef means Kiev but he misspells this word).  The 8th route is incorrect since there is no road from Miami to Kiev.  The 9th route is incorrect since there is no road from Donetsk to  Hollywood.  The 10th route is correct. Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly.  The 11th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli. (Probably Chef is not so good in geography :))  The 12th route is incorrect since city New-York is visited twice.  Finally the 13th route is incorrect since we have equal consecutive cities.
