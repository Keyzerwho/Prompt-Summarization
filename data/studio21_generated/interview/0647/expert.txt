 You are given a positive integer $N$ and a positive integer $S$. You should write a code such that, given $N$ and $S$ as input, it will generate random number with number of digits equal to $N$ and sum of digits equal to $S$. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain a single integer $T$, the number of testcases.  - Each testcase consists of two space separated integers, $N$ and $S$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output the answer on a new line. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq N \leq 18$ - $1 \leq S \leq 5 * N$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 1 5 2 2 -----Sample Output:----- 5 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- In first testcase, the only possible number of length 1 having digit sum 5 is 5. And it's product of digits is 5.  In second testcase,  only possible two digit number as a generator output is 11(as 20 is divisible by 10, it is never generated) and product of it's digits is 1.
