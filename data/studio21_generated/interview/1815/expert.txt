 You need to shift the first i+1 letters of S, x times. Return the final string after all such shifts to S are applied. 
Example 1: Input: S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9] Output: "rpl" Explanation:  We start with "abc". After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc". After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc". After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer. Note: 1 <= S.length = shifts.length <= 20000 0 <= shifts[i] <= 10 ^ 9
