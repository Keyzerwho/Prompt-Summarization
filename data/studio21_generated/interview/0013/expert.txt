 You are given an array of integers $n$. You want to lay new asphalt on the highway in such a way that at least $x$ units of the highway have high-quality pavement.
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Next $T$ lines contain test cases — one per line. Each line contains three integers $n$, $g$ and $b$ ($1 \le n, g, b \le 10^9$) — the length of the highway and the number of good and bad days respectively. -----Output----- Print $T$ integers — one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum number of days required to repair the whole highway if at least half of it should have high quality. -----Example----- Input 3 5 1 1 8 10 10 1000000 1 1000000 Output 5 8 499999500000 -----Note----- In the first test case, you can just lay new asphalt each day, since days $1, 3, 5$ are good. In the second test case, you can also lay new asphalt each day, since days $1$-$8$ are good.
