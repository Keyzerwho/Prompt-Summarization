 # Overview The goal here is to solve a puzzle (the "pieces of paper" kind of puzzle). You will receive different pieces of that puzzle as input, and you will have to find in what order you have to rearrange them so that the "picture" of the puzzle is complete. ### Puzzle pieces All the pieces of the puzzle will be represented in the following way: ### * 4 numbers, grouped in 2 tuples, which are representing the "picture" on the piece. Every piece has a 2x2 size. ### * 1 id number. All id numbers are unique in a puzzle, but their value may be random. ###
