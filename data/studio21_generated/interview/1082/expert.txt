 You are given $Q$ queries. Queries are of 2 type :- -  Ending Node Node of $Jaggu$ is given. $format$ - type of query node -(1 2) -  Sweetness of Apple on a given node is changed. $format$ - type of query node new sweetness(2 3 10) $Note$: $Jaggu$ is always on the top of tree initially in each query.The sweetness is always positive. Help $Jaggu$ in saving $Bheem
-----Input:----- - First line contains $N$ - (number of nodes).   - Next line contains $N$ integers with space giving sweetness of apple on Nodes $(1 to N)$ - Next $N-1$ lines contain  $N1$ $N2$ connected nodes. - Next line contains single integer $Q$ Number of queries -----Output:----- - For each query of type 1, print total sweetness of apples.  -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq N \leq 10^4$ - $2 \leq Q \leq 10^4$ -----Sample Input:----- 10 10 12 6 8 1 19 0 5 13 17 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 10 4 8 8 9 4 5 5 7 5 6 3 1 1 2 3 20 1 8 -----Sample Output:----- 10 23 -----EXPLANATION:----- This sweetness array is : $[10,2,6,8,1,19,0,5,13,17]$ The tree is: 1    /  |   \       2    3     4      /    /    \       10     8        5    /        /    \      9         7        6
