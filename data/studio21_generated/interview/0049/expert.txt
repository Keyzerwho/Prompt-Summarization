-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10^4$) — the number of segments in a testcase. Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ ($1 \le L_i \le R_i \le 10^{18}$). -----Output----- Print $T$ lines — the $i$-th line should contain the number of classy integers on a segment $[L_i; R_i]$. -----Example----- Input 4 1 1000 1024 1024 65536 65536 999999 1000001 Output 1000 1 0 2
