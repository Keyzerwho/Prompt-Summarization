 You are given n nodes in a graph. The $i$-th node starts with a value of $i$. The node values will be revised $q$ times. For the $j$-th revision, node $v_i$ will have a value of $n+i$. The node $v_i$ will have this value for the only the $j$-th revision, it will have value $i$ otherwise. Some nodes dislike with each other, if two nodes $a$ and $b$ dislike with each other and $a$ has a higher value than $b$
-----Input----- Please pay attention! No input will be given to your program for this problem. So you do not have to read from the input anything. -----Output----- You should output the generated small testcase (which Artha's solution doesn't get it right). It should be in the following format:  First line must contain the only number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500).  The i-th of the next n lines should contain the description of the i-th balloon — two space-separated integers x_{i}, p_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_{n} ≤ 10^6).  -----Examples----- -----Note----- The testcase depicted in the figure above (just showing how output should be formatted): 4 0 9 6 3 12 7 17 1
