 You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. You need to find the minimum number of moves required to change $A$ to $B$. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. - $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains $M$ integers $A_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, \dots, A_{i, M}$ NOT separated by spaces. -----Output----- For each test case, print $N$ lines. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain $M$ space-separated integers; for each valid $j$, the $j$-th of these integers should be the minimum number of moves required to make $A_{i, j}$ equal to $1$, or $-1$ if it is impossible. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N, M \le 1,000$ - $A_{i, j} \in \{0, 1\}$ for each valid $i, j$ - the sum of $N \cdot M$ for all test cases does not exceed $1,000,000$ -----Example Input----- 1 3 3 010 000 001 -----Example Output----- 1 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 0
