 You are given a string of any length containing numbers and operators: * '+' = add         * '-' = subtract   * '*' = multiply  * '$' = divide    You need to calculate expression using this order of operations. (division => multiplication => subtraction => addition) If you are given an invalid input (i.e. any character except `.0123456789+-*$`) you should return the error message:`'400: Bad request'` 
Examples:** ```python calculate('1+1')     => '2' calculate('10$2')    => '5' calculate('1.5*3')   => '4.5' calculate('5+5+5+5') => '20' calculate('1000$2.5$5+5-5+6$6') =>'81' calculate('10-9p')   =>  '400: Bad request' ``` ### Further Notes - Parameters outside of this challenge: - Brackets e.g. 10*(1+2) - Square root, log, % or any other operators - Unary minus (10*-1) - Bad mathematical input (10**$10 or 5+5$) - You may have to deal with floats If enjoy this and want something harder please see http://www.codewars.com/kata/evaluate-mathematical-expression/ for making a much more complicated calculator. This is a good kata leading up to that.
