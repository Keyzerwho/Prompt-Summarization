 You are given a string `steps` consisting of integers. Your task is to return the smallest integer exceeding or equal to `n` whose Collatz steps start with `steps`. 
Examples ```python collatz_steps(1, 'UUDU') == 11 collatz_steps(100, 'UUDU') == 107 collatz_steps(1000, 'UUDU') == 1003 collatz_steps(1, 'UD') == 1 collatz_steps(1, 'UDUD') == 1 collatz_steps(1, 'UDUDUD') == 1 ``` # Hint If you are completely lost, start by answering the following question: * After applying the given steps (e.g. `UUDU`) to an initial number `x`,   what fraction do you get?    After that, you might want to study about [modular inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse). # Acknowledgement This problem was inspired by [Project Euler #277: A Modified Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=277).
