 Given string, check if it can be rearranged to form a "Doublindrome" (i.e. both halves of the string are palindromes). 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain a single integer $T$, the number of testcases.  - Each testcase consists of two lines, first line consists of an integer $N$ (length of the string) and second line consists of  the string $S$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, print "YES"(without quotes) or "NO"(without quotes) on a new line. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq N \leq 100$ - $N$ is always even. - String $S$ consists only of lowercase English alphabets. -----Sample Input:----- 1 8 abbacddc -----Sample Output:----- YES -----EXPLANATION:----- The given string is a Doublindrome as its 2 halves "abba" and "cddc" are palindromes.
