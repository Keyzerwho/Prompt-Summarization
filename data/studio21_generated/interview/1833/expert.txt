 Given a binary tree, return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree. The subtree of a node is tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.   Example 1: Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4] Output: [2,7,4] Explanation: We return the node with value 2, coloured in yellow in the diagram. The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree. Notice that nodes
