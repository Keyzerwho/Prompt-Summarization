 Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse). When you get an instruction "A", your car does the following: position += speed, speed *= 2. When you get an instruction "R", your car does the following: if your speed is positive then speed = -1 , otherwise speed = 1. (Your position stays the same.) For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0->1
