 You are given three integers $A$, $B$, $C$.  You are asked to create a list (array).  Initialize the list by adding $N$ to it.  Divide $N$ by $A$ and if the first digit of the fractional part is 0 then add this digit to the list.  If the first digit of the fractional part is 1 then add this digit to the list.  If the first digit of the fractional part is 2 then add this digit to the list.  If the first digit of the fractional part is 3 then add this digit to the list. 
-----Input:----- - The First Line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The First Line of each test case contains the  integer $N$. - The second line of each test case contains three integers $A$, $B$, and $C$ separated by a space - The third line of each test case contains an integer $Q$. - Then the next $Q$ line follows.   - An integer $i$ (0 <= $i$ <= 10^9 ) -----Output:----- You have to answer the $Q$ queries in the next $Q$ lines.  -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^9$ - $2 \leq A \leq 10$ - $2 \leq B \leq 10$ - $2 \leq C \leq 10$ - $2 \leq Q \leq 100$ - $0 \leq i \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 56 3 5 7 4 0 1 2 3 -----Sample Output:----- 56 6 2 2 -----EXPLANATION:----- This list is : $N$ = 56 and $A$ = 3, $B$ = 5, $C$ = 7.  Initially $LIST$ = $[ 56 ]$ $N$$/$$A$ =  56/3 = 18.666666666666668  Add 6 to the $LIST$  $LIST$ = $[ 56, 6 ]$ $N$ = 6  $N$$/$$B$ = 6/5 = 1.2  Add 2 to the$LIST$  $LIST$ = $[ 56, 6, 2 ]$ N = 2  $N$$/$$C$ = 2/7 =0. 2857142857142857 Add 2 to the $LIST$.   $LIST$ = $[ 56, 6, 2, 2 ]$ $N$  = 2 We have to keep repeating this process. If any of the numbers got by $N$ dividing by either $A$, $B$, $C$ have 0 after the decimal point then we have to take the first digit of the number.  for example: if we got 12.005 then here we take 1 and add it to the list and then assign N = 1  Now the queries ask for the elements at index 0, 1, 2, 3 of the $LIST$ which is 56,6, 2, 2
