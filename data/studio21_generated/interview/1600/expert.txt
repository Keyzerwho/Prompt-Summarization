 You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action: Spin the wheel till the needle encounters number K; If the needle encounters number K then print $a[\frac{K+i}{2}] := i$.  
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases . The description of T testcases follow. - The first line of each test case contains single integer N . - The second line of each test case contains N space seperated integers denoting the numbers on the wheel. - The third line of each test case contains a single integer Q denoting the number of players. - Then, Q lines follow a single integer K from the N numbers of the wheel  -----Output----- For each player, output the minimum number of coins Shivam has to spend. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 - 1 ≤ Number written on the Wheel ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10000 - 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000 -  It is guaranteed that K belongs to the N numbers written on the wheel. -----Example----- Input: 2 3 1 2 3 3 1 2 3 6 2 1 5 3 2 1 4 1 2 3 5 Output: 3 3 3 2 2 6 6
