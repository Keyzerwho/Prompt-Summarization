 You are given weighted undirected graph consisting of n$n$ nodes and m$m$ edges. Each edge has a weight. You are given an integer X. You need to count the number of different walks of length 4 such that cost = X. 
-----Input:----- - First line contains 2 integers : the number of nodes n$n$ and number of edges m$m$. - Next m$m$ lines each describe u$u$, v$v$ and w$w$, describing an edge between u$u$ and v$v$ with weight w$w$. - Next line contains q$q$, the number of queries. - Next q$q$ lines each describe an integer X$X$ - the cost of the walk in the query. -----Output:----- For each query, output in a single line the number of different possible walks. -----Constraints----- - 1≤n≤100$1 \leq n \leq 100$ - 1≤m≤n(n−1)2$1 \leq m \leq \frac{n (n-1)}{2}$ - 1≤u,v≤n$1 \leq u, v \leq n$ - 1≤w≤100$1 \leq w \leq 100$ - 1≤q≤100$1 \leq q \leq 100$ - 1≤X≤100$1 \leq X \leq 100$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 3 1 2 3 -----Sample Output:----- 2 10 36 -----EXPLANATION:----- For X=2$X = 2$, all possible 10$10$ walks are listed below : - 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 - 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 - 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 - 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 - 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 - 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 - 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 - 3 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 3
