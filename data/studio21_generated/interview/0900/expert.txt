 On her way to ChefLand, Marichka noticed $10^K$ road signs (numbered $0$ through $10^K - 1$). For each valid $i$, the sign with number $i$ had the integer $i$ written on one side and $10^K-i-1$ written on the other side. Now, Marichka is wondering   how many road signs have exactly two distinct decimal digits written on them (on both sides in total)  Since this number may be large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $K$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of road signs with exactly two digits, modulo $10^9+7$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): $1 \le T, K \le 5$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 1 -----Example Output----- 10
