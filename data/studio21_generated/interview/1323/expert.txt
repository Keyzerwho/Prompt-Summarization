 You are given a sequence of stations along the railway route. The minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all! In other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N
-----Input:----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$. -----Output:----- The first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$. - $-10^9 \leq p_i \leq 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$ - Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints -----Sample Input----- 8 -20 90 -30 -20 80 -70 -60 125 -----Sample Output----- -5 6 8
