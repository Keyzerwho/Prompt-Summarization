 Create a function that takes a Number as its argument and returns a Chinese numeral string. You don't need to validate the input argument, it will always be a Number in the range `[-99999.999, 99999.999]`, rounded to 8 decimal places. Simplified Chinese numerals have characters representing each number from 0 to 9 and additional numbers representing larger numbers like 10, 100, 1000, and 10000.  ``` 0 l ng   1 y    2  r   3 s
