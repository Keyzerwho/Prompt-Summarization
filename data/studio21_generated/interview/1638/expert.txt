 Given a string, find the longest palindrome substring. 
NOTE:** Quadratic asymptotic complexity _(O(N^2))_ or above will __NOT__ work here. ----- ## Examples ### Basic Tests ``` Input: "babad" Output: "bab" (Note: "bab" occurs before "aba") ``` ``` Input: "abababa" Output: "abababa" ``` ``` Input: "cbbd" Output: "bb" ``` ### Edge Cases ``` Input: "ab" Output: "a" ``` ``` Input: "" Output: "" ``` ----- ## Testing Along with the example tests given:  - There are **500** tests using strings of length in range [1 - 1,000]  - There are **50** tests using strings of length in range [1,000 - 10,000]  - There are **5** tests using strings of length in range [10,000 - 100,000]   All test cases can be passed within 10 seconds, but non-linear solutions will time out every time. _Linear performance is essential_.  ## Good Luck! ----- This problem was inspired by [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/) challenge on LeetCode. Except this is the performance version :^)
