 In this kata you have to create all permutations of an input string. This means, you have to shuffle all letters from the input in all possible orders. 
Examples: ```python permutations('a'); # ['a'] permutations('ab'); # ['ab', 'ba'] permutations('aabb'); # ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa'] ``` The order of the permutations doesn't matter.
