 you are given an array s of dimension 2 * n, where, if s[i][j] = '*', it denotes that there is a snake in the house at coordinates (i, j), and if s[i][j] = '.', it denotes that the house is empty.  These snakes are planning a coup against a mongoose who controls their city from outside. So, they are trying their best to meet with other snakes and spread information about the date of the coup. For spreading this information, they can just hiss from their house and usually their hiss is so loud that it will be heard in all the cells except
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The descriptions of the T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer, n. Each of the next two lines contains n characters denoting the first and the second rows of Snakeland respectively. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the minimum number of fences that the mongoose needs to build. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ n ≤ 105 -----Example----- Input 3 2 ** ** 3 *** *.. 3 *.. .*. Output 2 3 1 -----Explanation----- All the examples are shown in the pictures. The fences built are shown by red colored horizontal or vertical segments. You can see that after putting these borders no snake can talk with any another snake.
