 Given $N$ positive integers find if there exists an odd number which is an integer multiple of all the given $N$ numbers. If yes, print "YES", otherwise "NO". You can print any letter in any case. 
-----Input----- - First line contains $T$, number of testcases. Each testcase consists of $2$ lines. - The first line of each test case consists of a positive integer $N$, denoting the number of positive integers Chef has. - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space separated integers $A_i$ each denoting an integer that Chef has with him. -----Output----- For every test case, if there exists such an odd number, print "YES" on a separate line, otherwise "NO". The judge is case insensitive. That means, your code can print any letter in any case ( "Yes", "yes" or "YES" are all accepted). -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^3$ -----Sample Input----- 2 5 1 2 5 4 3 1 7 -----Sample Output----- NO YES -----Explanation----- For test $1$: There exists no odd number. For test $2$: The possible odd numbers can be $7$, $21$, $49$, $315$, â€¦
