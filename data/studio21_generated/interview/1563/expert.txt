 You are given two numbers. You need to add them and return the output in reversed arabic form, assuming no zeroes were lost while reversing.
-----Input----- The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only a positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers seperated by space. These are the reversednumbers you are to add. -----Output----- For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer- the reversed sum of two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeroes in the output. -----Example----- Input: 1 24 1 Output: 34
