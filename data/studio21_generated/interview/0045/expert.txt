 You are given an integer $n$, a non-negative integer $x$ and an integer $k$. You have to output the number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than $x$ cells, in total. You may assume that $k$ is the number of columns, $1 \leq k \leq n$.  
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \le t \le 1000)$  — the number of test cases. The description of each test case contains a single integer $x$ $(1 \le x \le 10^{18})$  — the number of cells for building staircases. -----Output----- For each test case output a single integer  — the number of different nice staircases, that can be built, using not more than $x$ cells, in total. -----Example----- Input 4 1 8 6 1000000000000000000 Output 1 2 1 30 -----Note----- In the first test case, it is possible to build only one staircase, that consists of $1$ stair. It's nice. That's why the answer is $1$. In the second test case, it is possible to build two different nice staircases: one consists of $1$ stair, and another consists of $3$ stairs. This will cost $7$ cells. In this case, there is one cell left, but it is not possible to use it for building any nice staircases, that have not been built yet. That's why the answer is $2$. In the third test case, it is possible to build only one of two nice staircases: with $1$ stair or with $3$ stairs. In the first case, there will be $5$ cells left, that may be used only to build a staircase with $2$ stairs. This staircase is not nice, and Jett only builds nice staircases. That's why in this case the answer is $1$. If Jett builds a staircase with $3$ stairs, then there are no more cells left, so the answer is $1$ again.
