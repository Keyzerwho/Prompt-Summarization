 You are given T pairs of dishes. You need to check if the two dishes are similar and print "similar" or "dissimilar" accordingly. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains four distinct strings, denoting ingredients needed for the first dish. Each ingredient is represented by a string of length between 2 and 10 inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters. The second line of each test case describes the second dish in the same format. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the answer — "similar" if at least half of the ingredients are same, and "dissimilar" otherwise (without the quotes). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 200 - The length of each string will be between 2 and 10 inclusive. -----Example----- Input: 5 eggs sugar flour salt sugar eggs milk flour aa ab ac ad ac ad ae af cookies sugar grass lemon lemon meat chili wood one two three four one two three four gibberish jibberish lalalalala popopopopo jibberisz gibberisz popopopopu lalalalalu Output: similar similar dissimilar similar dissimilar -----Explanation----- Test case 1. The first dish consists of ingredients: eggs, sugar, flour, salt, while the second dish consists of: sugar, eggs, milk, flour. Three of four ingredients are present in both dishes (eggs, sugar, flour) so the two dishes are similar. Test case 2. This example shows that strings in the input don't necessarily represent real food. The answer is again "similar", because two ingredients are present in both dishes ("ac" and "ad"). Test case 3. The only common ingredient is lemon, so the answer is "dissimilar". Remember that at least two ingredients should be present in both dishes.
