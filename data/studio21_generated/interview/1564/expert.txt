 Given an uppercase string S consisting of only uppercase Latin letters, find the number of different country codes that appear in S as contiguous substrings. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains a string S, consisting of uppercase Latin letters. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the number of different country codes appearing in the given string. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - Subtask 1 (35 points): 2 ≤ |S| ≤ 3 - Subtask 2 (65 points): 2 ≤ |S| ≤ 104 -----Example----- Input:2 INBY BYBY Output:3 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. The codes are IN, NB and BY. Example case 2. The codes are BY and YB.
