 You are given a string. Find all possible anagrams of the word. 
-----Input----- Input begins with a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. After that T lines follow each containing a single string S - the word chef has chosen. You can assume that 1 <= T <= 500 and 1 <= |S| <= 500. You can also assume that no character repeats more than 10 times in the string.  -----Output----- Output one line per test case - the number of different words that are anagrams of the word that chef has chosen. As answer can get huge, print it modulo 10^9 + 7 -----Example----- Input: 4 ab aa aA AAbaz Output: 2 1 2 60 Description: In first case "ab" & "ba" are two different words. In third case, note that A & a are different alphabets and hence "Aa" & "aA" are different words.
