 Given a sequence of integers, Chef wants to know the number of sub-sequences of the given sequence, for which, playing the above game on the subsuquence will terminate on $1$. A sub-sequence can be obtained from the original sequence by deleting $0$ or more integers from the original sequence. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases. Then follow the description of $T$ test cases.  - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$, the length of the sequence.  - The second line contains $N$ positive integers, each separated by a single space. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer - the number of sub-sequences of the original sequence, such that, playing the game on the sub-sequence results in ending the game with all the values equal to $1$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$  - $1 \le N \le 60$  - $1 \le A_i \le 10^4$  - All $A_i$ will be distinct. -----Sample Input----- 3 4 2 3 5 7 4 3 4 8 16 3 6 10 15 -----Sample Output----- 11 7 1 -----Explanation----- Test Case 1: The following $11$ sub-sequences are counted. - $\{ 2, 3 \}$ - $\{ 2, 5 \}$ - $\{ 2, 7 \}$ - $\{ 3, 5 \}$ - $\{ 3, 7 \}$ - $\{ 5, 7 \}$ - $\{ 2, 3, 5 \}$ - $\{ 2, 3, 7 \}$ - $\{ 2, 5, 7 \}$ - $\{ 3, 5, 7 \}$ - $\{ 2, 3, 5, 7 \}$ Test Case 2: The following $7$ sub-sequences are counted. - $\{ 3, 4 \}$ - $\{ 3, 8 \}$ - $\{ 3, 16 \}$ - $\{ 3, 4, 8 \}$ - $\{ 3, 4, 16 \}$ - $\{ 3, 8, 16 \}$ - $\{ 3, 4, 8, 16 \}$ Test Case 3: There are $8$ subsequences of $\{ 6, 10, 15 \}$ - $\{\}$ => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence - $\{ 6 \}$ => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence - $\{ 10 \}$ => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence - $\{ 15 \}$ => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence - $\{ 6, 10 \}$ => The game cannot end at $\{ 1, 1 \}$ - $\{ 6, 15 \}$ => The game cannot end at $\{ 1, 1 \}$ - $\{ 10, 15 \}$ => The game cannot end at $\{ 1, 1 \}$ - $\{ 6, 10, 15 \}$ => The game ends at $\{ 1, 1, 1 \}$. Hence this is the only sub-sequence that is counted in the result.
