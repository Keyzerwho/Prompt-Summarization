 Create a function that finds the largest palindromic number made from the product of **at least 2** of the given arguments. ### Notes * Only non-negative numbers will be given in the argument * You don't need to use all the digits of the products * Single digit numbers are considered palindromes * Optimization is needed: dealing with ones and zeros in a smart way will help a lot ## Examples ``` [937, 113] --> 81518 ``` As `937 * 113 = 105881` and the largest palindromic number that can be arranged from the digits of result is:
