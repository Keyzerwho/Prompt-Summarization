 Write a class called User that is used to calculate the amount that a user will progress through a ranking system similar to the one Codewars uses.   ##### Business Rules: * A user starts at rank -8 and can progress all the way to 8. * There is no 0 (zero) rank. The next rank after -1 is 1. * Users will complete activities. These activities also have ranks. * Each time the user completes a ranked activity the users rank progress is updated based off of the activity's rank * The progress earned from the completed activity is relative to what the user's current rank is compared to the rank of the activity *
