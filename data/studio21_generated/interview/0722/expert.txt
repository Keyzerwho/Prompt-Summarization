 You are given an NxN grid. The snakes are occupying the NxN grid. The poison is stored in the KxK grid. The arrows travel across a row (from left to right, or right to left), or across a column (top to bottom or bottom to top) in a straight line. If the arrow enters the KxK grid, some of the poison will stick to the arrow, and if it exits the NxN grid after that, the thieves will have successfully stolen some of the poison. As the King of the snakes, you want to thwart these attempts. You know that the arrows will break and stop
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer, T, the number of testcases. - The first line of each testcase contains three integers: N, K and M, where N is the size of the entire square grid, K is the size of the square containing the poison, and M is the number of initial snakes. - M lines follow, the i-th of which contains four integers: HXi, HYi, TXi, TYi. (HXi, HYi) is the cell which contains the head of the i-th snake. (TXi, TYi) is the cell which contains the tail of the i-th snake. It is guaranteed that both these cells will either lie in the same row, or same column. And hence the cells in between them, including these two cells, represents the i-th snake. -----Output----- - For each testcase, output a single integer in a new line: The minimum number of the snakes that the king can keep and still protect the poison. If it is not possible to protect the poison even with all the snakes, output -1. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 4 - 3 ≤ N ≤ 109 - 1 ≤ K ≤ N-2 - Both N and K will be odd integers - 1 ≤ M ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ HXi, HYi, TXi, TYi ≤ N - It is guaranteed that at least one of (HXi = TXi), and (HYi = TYi) will be true for all i - None of the cells in the KxK grid will be occupied by any snake -----Example----- Input: 2 7 3 7 1 1 6 1 1 2 3 2 5 2 5 2 2 4 2 6 6 2 6 4 5 6 5 7 7 1 7 4 7 3 7 1 1 6 1 1 2 3 2 5 2 5 2 2 6 2 6 6 2 6 4 5 6 5 7 7 1 7 4 Output: 3 -1 -----Explanation----- The first example corresponds to: Note that the top-left corner cell of the NxN grid is by definition, (1,1). The inner square contains the poison, and the seven snakes are shown in different colours. The green snake is the 1st snake in the input. We can remove all but 3 snakes and protect the poison. One such configuration is this: You can check that no arrow can enter the inner poison square and exit the outer square without hitting a snake. Hence is it safe. Also, you cannot do this with fewer snakes. Hence 3 is the answer. The second testcase corresponds to: You can check that even with all the snakes, this is not a safe configuration, because the thieves can shoot an arrow down the 5th column, and they can steal poison. Hence, the answer is -1.
