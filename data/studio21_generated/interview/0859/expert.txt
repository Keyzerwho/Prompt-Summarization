 You are given $N$ natural numbers. You need to find $K$-th highest number.
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. - The line of each test case contains a two integers $N$ and $K$. -----Output:----- For each test case, print a single line containing integer $K$-th highest number else print -$1$ when invalid command pressed. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$ - $1 \leq K \leq N$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 4 2 5 5 -----Sample Output:----- 2 0 -----EXPLANATION:----- For first valid constraints generating output as 0 2 1 5  1^1 first BT number is 0 2^0 second BT number is 2 3^2 third BT number is 1 4^1 fourth BT number is 5 Hence the answer is 2.
