 Given an integer $N$, find the number of special numbers (numbers whose product of their digits is equal to $N$) and partial special numbers (numbers with one or more 1's). 
-----Input:----- - Integers $N$ is taken as input from input stream.  -----Output:----- - Print the number of  $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq N \leq 100$ numbers to be count will be less then 10^6 -----Sample Input:----- 3 -----Sample Output:----- 1 20 -----EXPLANATION:----- There are only one natural numbers, the product of the digits of which is 3  :- {3}. There are 20 natural numbers with digit 1 , whose  product of the digits  is 3 :-{13, 31, 113 ,131 311 ,1113 ,1131 ,1311, 3111 ,11113, 11131, 11311 ,13111, 31111, 111113, 111131, 111311,113111, 131111 ,311111}
