 You are given N and K, you need to output the expected length of the compressed string for given N and K if the input string is randomly uniformly chosen from all possibilities.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of queries. The description of T test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and K denoting the number of letters in the input string and the maximum number of distinct characters that can be present in the string. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the expected length of the compressed string.  Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error is less than 10-2 -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ N, K ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 2 3 1 3 2 Output: 2.0 4.0 -----Explanation-----Example case 1: There is only one string: aaa with compressed string = a, 3. Therefore length = 2 Example case 2 Input strings: "aaa": "a, 3". Length = 2 "aab": "a, 2, b, 1". Length = 4  "aba": "a, 1, b, 1, a, 1". Length = 6 "abb": "a, 1, b, 2". Length = 4 "baa": "b, 1, a, 2". Length = 4 "bab": "b, 1, a, 1, b, 1". Length = 6 "bba": "b, 2, a, 1". Length = 4 "bbb": "b, 3". Length = 2 Expected value = (2+4+6+4+4+6+4+2)/8 = 32/8 = 4
