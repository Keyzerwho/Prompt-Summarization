 You are given two positive integers M and F, 
-----Input----- - First line contains single integer T denoting test cases. - Second Line contains single integer N for number of challengers. - Third Line contains space separated two integer denoting strength M & F - Next Line contains strength space separated N integer ith of which denoting Si of N challengers respectively. -----Output----- - Yes or No corresponding the result. - Also, if Yes, print, Multan, Fultan, Both accordingly.  -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ M, F ≤ 109 - 0 ≤ Si ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 2 7 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 14 6 5 7 1 2 8 9 10 11 Output: Yes Multan No -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Multan (M) defeats total 4 challengers with strengths 4, 8, 10, 14 and Fultan (F) defeats 1 challenger with strength 9. Their total wins are 5 out of 7 and win accuracy of 71.4%. Hence, 'Yes' and since Multan is better wrestler so 'Multan' Example case 2. Multan defeats 1 and Fultan defeat 0 challengers. Total wins 1 out of 6 with accuracy 16.67% Hence, No.
