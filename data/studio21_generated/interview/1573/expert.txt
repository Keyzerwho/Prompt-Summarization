 You are given $N$ players with $1 \le i \le N$.  You need to find number of matches that Naman has to win so that everybody is happy.  
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players. -----Output:----- - If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes). - Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$.  - If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins.  - You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied. - You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $2 \leq N \leq 100$ -----Subtasks----- - 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$ - 90 points :  Original Constraints.  -----Sample Input:----- 2 3 2 -----Sample Output:----- YES 010 001 100 NO -----Explanation:----- One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.
