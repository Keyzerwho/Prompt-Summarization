 You are given a collection of tiles with 0 or 1 written on them. To amuse herself, Lavanya has decided to pick a number $N$ and try and construct as many binary sequences of length $N$ as possible using her collection of tiles. For example if $N$ = 1, she can only make the sequence 1. For $N$=2, she can make 11 and 00. For $N$=4, there are 5 possibilities: 0011, 0000, 1001, 1100 and 1111. Lava
-----Input:----- A single line with a single integer $N$. -----Output:----- A single integer indicating the number of binary sequences of length $N$, modulo 15746, that Lavanya can make using her tiles. -----Constraints:----- You may assume that $N \leq$ 1000000. -----Sample Input:----- 4 -----Sample Output:----- 5 -----Explanation:----- This corresponds to the example discussed above.
