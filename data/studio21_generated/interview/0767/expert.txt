 N citizens of Tutaria participate in three events. Each citizen takes t seconds in COBOL, u seconds in pole vault, and v seconds in doughnut eating. The Supreme Leader wants to arrange them in such a way that the event ends as early as possible. 
-----Input format----- The first line of input has a single integer, N, the number of citizens of the Republic of Tutaria. The next N lines contain 3 space-separated integers each: line i gives the time taken by the citizen i for COBOL programming, pole vault, and doughnut-eating respectively. -----Output format----- The output should have a single line with a single integer, the earliest time at which the event can end. -----Test Data----- The testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs. • Subtask 1 [30 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 3000. • Subtask 2 [70 points] : 1 ≤ N ≤ 200000. In both the subtasks, all the numbers in the input (except possibly N) are in the range 1 to 10000, inclusive. -----Example----- Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above. -----Sample input----- 3 18 7 6  23 10 27 20 9 14 -----Sample output----- 74 -----Note:----- Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format. Please remove all diagnostic print statements before making your final submission. A program with extraneous output will be treated as incorrect!
