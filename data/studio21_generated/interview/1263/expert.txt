 You are given an array of integers. Find the maximum number of summands that can be included in the sum. 
-----Input:----- - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.  - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$.  -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq K \leq 6$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 4 1 38 2 -----Sample Output:----- 2 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power) But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers.  For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25
