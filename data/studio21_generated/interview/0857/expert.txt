 You have two crews. Draws and losses are zero points. Each member of the crew can compete in only one race per round. Each crew has the same number of members. Dom and his crew have a reputation of being the best. Given the time it takes each member of the two crews to complete the race, you have to figure out the number of races Dom will win. 
-----Input----- The first line of input is the T, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single number N, the number of racers on each crew. This is followed by two lines, each having N space separated integers containing the time taken by each member of Dominic's crew and the rival crew respectively. -----Output----- Output a single integer. The maximum number of points that Dominic can get. -----Constraints----- 1<=T<=100 1<=N<=100 Time taken by each member will be between 1 and 500 -----Example----- Input: 1 3 5 4 1 5 4 1 Output: 2 -----Explanation----- If Dom selects Racer 1 of his team to go against Racer 2 of the other team, Racer 2 of his team against Racer 3 of the other team and Racer 3 of his team against Racer 1 of the other team then he ends up with two wins and a loss which gives him 2 points. ...
