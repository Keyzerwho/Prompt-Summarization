 You are given a string "S" representing the initial state. S[i] = 'L', if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left; S[i] = 'R', if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right; S[i] = '.', if the i-th domino has not been pushed. Return a string representing the final state. 
Example 1: Input: ".L.R...LR..L.." Output: "LL.RR.LLRRLL.." Example 2: Input: "RR.L" Output: "RR.L" Explanation: The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino. Note: 0 <= N <= 10^5 String dominoes contains only 'L', 'R' and '.'
