 You are given an array $a$ consisting of 2 elements $0$ and $1$ ($a = [0, 1]$). After sorting the array, $a$ becomes: ``` [1, 0] ``` Your task is to find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form. Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements. 
Example 1: Input: [3,6,9,1] Output: 3 Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either Â             (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3. Example 2: Input: [10] Output: 0 Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0. Note:        You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.        Try to solve it in linear time/space.
