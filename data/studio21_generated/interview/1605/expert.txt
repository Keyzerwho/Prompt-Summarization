 You are given 2 integers a,b. You have to find the sum of all nice integers. Positive integer x is called nice if $\operatorname{mod}(x, b) \neq 0$ and $\frac{\operatorname{div}(x, b)}{\operatorname{mod}(x, b)} = k$, where k is some integer number in range [1, a]. By $\operatorname{div}(x, y)$ we denote the quotient of integer division of x and y. By $\operatorname{mod}(x, y)
-----Input----- The single line of the input contains two integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^7). -----Output----- Print a single integer representing the answer modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 1 1 Output 0 Input 2 2 Output 8 -----Note----- For the first sample, there are no nice integers because $\operatorname{mod}(x, 1)$ is always zero. For the second sample, the set of nice integers is {3, 5}.
