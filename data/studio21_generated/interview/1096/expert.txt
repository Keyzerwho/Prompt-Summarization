 You can reach the centre exactly at the starting time of the contest, if possible. And you can leave the examination centre the very second the contest ends, if possible. You can assume that you will always be able to attend at least one contest that is, there will always be a contest such that there is a V wormhole before it and a W wormhole after it. For instance, suppose there are 3 contests with (start,end) times (15,21), (5,10), and (7,25), respectively.  Suppose the V wormhole is available at times 4, 14, 25, 2
-----Input format----- The first line contains 3 space separated integers N, X, and Y, where N is the number of contests, X is the number of time instances when wormhole V can be used and Y is the number of time instances when wormhole W can be used.  The next N lines describe each contest.  Each of these N lines contains two space separated integers S and E, where S is the starting time of the particular contest and E is the ending time of that contest, with S < E.  The next line contains X space separated integers which are the time instances when the wormhole V can be used.  The next line contains Y space separated integers which are the time instances when the wormhole W can be used. -----Output format----- Print a single line that contains a single integer, the minimum time needed to be spent to take part in a contest. -----Testdata----- All the starting and ending times of contests are distinct and no contest starts at the same time as another contest ends. The time instances when wormholes are available are all distinct, but may coincide with starting and ending times of contests. All the time instances (the contest timings and the wormhole timings) will be integers between 1 and 1000000 (inclusive). - Subtask 1 (30 marks) - Subtask 2 (70 marks) You may assume that  1 ≤ N ≤ 105, 1 ≤ X ≤ 105, and 1 ≤ Y ≤ 105. In 30% of the cases,  1 ≤ N ≤ 103, 1 ≤ X ≤ 103, and 1 ≤ Y ≤ 103. -----Sample Input----- 3 4 2 15 21 5 10 7 25 4 14 25 2 13 21 -----Sample Output----- 8
