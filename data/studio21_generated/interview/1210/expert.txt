 You are given a list of juniors and the counting could start from left or right you have to predict which number you have to speak and in which language when your turn comes. 
-----Input:----- -  First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  -  Each testcase contains 2 lines first consist 2 space separated integers, $N$ (total count) , $X$ (your position from left), next line consist of 2 space separated characters  L or R (Direction from which counting starts L-left, R-Right) and H or E (the language to start counting). -----Output:----- For each testcase, output a single line consisting space seperated Integer P and Character L where P is the number you will speak and L is the language (H or E). -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 120$ - $1 \leq X \leq N$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 15 5 L H 20 14 R E *try to trim extra white spaces like new line during input in case of wrong answer -----Sample Output:----- 5 H 7 E -----EXPLANATION:----- - When counting starts from left with H it alternates like H E H E H….. on the fifth position H comes - When Count starts from right with E it alternates like E H E H E H E….. with E on the position of 14th student from right.
