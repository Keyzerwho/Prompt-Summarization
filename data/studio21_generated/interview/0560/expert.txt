 You are given two integer arrays of length N. For each array, you need to find the sum of finish times of all races. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. - The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN. - The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BN. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins or "Draw" if the result is a draw (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000 for each valid i - 1 ≤ Bi ≤ 1000 for each valid i -----Example----- Input: 3 5 3 1 3 3 4 1 6 2 5 3 5 1 6 2 5 3 3 1 3 3 4 3 4 1 3 2 2 7 Output: Alice Bob Draw -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Alice will choose the finish time in the last race to be considered zero, which means her sum of finish times is 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 10, while Bob will choose the finish time of his second race to be considered zero, so his total sum of finish times is 1 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 11. Since Alice's sum is smaller, she is considered the winner. Example case 2: We're dealing with the same situation as in the previous case, but finish times for the players are swapped, so Bob wins this time. Example case 3: Alice will choose the finish time of the first race to be considered zero, which means her total time is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4. Bob will choose the finish time of his last race to be considered zero, which makes his total time 2 + 2 + 0 = 4. The competition is considered a draw because both players have equal sums of finish times.
