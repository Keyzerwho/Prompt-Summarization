 The input is a N   N grid initially filled by zeros. You need to find the maximum element in the grid.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and Q denoting the size of the grid and the number of performed operations respectively. Each of the following Q lines describe an operation in the format described above. -----Output----- Output a single line containing the maximum number at the grid after performing all the operations. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N ≤ 314159 - 1 ≤ Q ≤ 314159 - 1 ≤ X ≤ 3141 - 1 ≤ R, C ≤ N -----Example----- Input: 2 4 RowAdd 1 3 ColAdd 2 1 ColAdd 1 4 RowAdd 2 1 Output: 7 -----Explanation----- The grid changes as follows: 00  33  34  74  74 00  00  01  41  52 The maximum number in the final grid is 7.
