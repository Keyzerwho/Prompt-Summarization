 You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ operations with this array: during the $i$-th operation, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum length subarray consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd (not divisible by $2$) then assign (set) $a[\frac{l+r}{2}] 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pokémon and number of operations respectively. The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pokémon. $i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pokémon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.  -----Output----- For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap. -----Example----- Input 3 3 0 1 3 2 2 0 1 2 7 0 1 2 5 4 3 6 7 Output 3 2 9 -----Note----- In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5−3+7=9$.
