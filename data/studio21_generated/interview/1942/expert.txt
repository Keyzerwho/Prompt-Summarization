Constraints: 1 <= favoriteCompanies.length <= 100 1 <= favoriteCompanies[i].length <= 500 1 <= favoriteCompanies[i][j].length <= 20 All strings in favoriteCompanies[i] are distinct. All lists of favorite companies are distinct, that is, If we sort alphabetically each list then favoriteCompanies[i] != favoriteCompanies
