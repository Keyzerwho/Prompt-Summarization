 Given an array of integers, return the length of the longest mountain.  Return 0 if there is no mountain. 
Example 1: Input: [2,1,4,7,3,2,5] Output: 5 Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5. Example 2: Input: [2,2,2] Output: 0 Explanation: There is no mountain. Note: 0 <= A.length <= 10000 0 <= A[i] <= 10000 Follow up: Can you solve it using only one pass? Can you solve it in O(1) space?
