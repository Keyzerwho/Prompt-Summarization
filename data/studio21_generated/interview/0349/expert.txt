 Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array. In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points.  After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1. You start with 0 points.  Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations. Note: The length of nums is at most 20000. Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].
