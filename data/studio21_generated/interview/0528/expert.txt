 The Principal wants to find minimum number of shots taken to find the distance X by using $N$ bullets. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $N, L$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer the minimum number of shots to find the distance X. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $2 \leq N,L \leq 100$ *N is always less than  equal to square root of L -----Subtasks----- - 10 points : $ N = 1$ - 40 points : $ N = 2$ - 50 points : Original Constraints. -----Sample Input:----- 2 1 10 2 10 -----Sample Output:----- 10 4 -----EXPLANATION:----- -  There is only single bullet which is to be fired from distance 1 to 10 to get the distance X so in the worst case it can take up to 10 shots to find the distance X. -  there are 2 bullets and distance 10 meters suppose if distance X is 10 we can get to that by firing first bullet at 4 then 7 then 9 then  at 10 it will break  it took only 4 turns, and if the distance X was 3, we can get that by firing first bullet at 4 it will get destroyed than we use 2nd bullet at 1 , 2, 3  and 2nd bullet will also break it also took 4 turns. You can check for any position minimum number of turns will be at most 4.
