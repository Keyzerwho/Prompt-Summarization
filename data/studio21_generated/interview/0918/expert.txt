 Mr. Wire Less is not that good at implementing circuit in a breadboard. In his Digital Logic Design course, he has to implement several boolean functions using the breadboard. In a breadboard, inputs are given through the switches and outputs are taken through the LEDs. Each input switch can be either in ground state or in high state. So, if he wishes to implement a boolean function, f(x1, x2, .., xn) that takes n boolean values as input and returns m boolean values as output, he will use n switches and m LEDs.  Mr. Wire Less can quickly assemble the necessary ICs and wires,
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a positive integer T(T ≤ 105), denoting the number of test-case. Each of the following T lines contains a single non-negative integer n(n ≤ 1020). -----Output----- For every test-case, output a single containing test-case number and the minimum number of switch-toggle modulo 8589934592 (233). -----Sample-----  Input    2 1 2 Output Case 1: 1 Case 2: 3
