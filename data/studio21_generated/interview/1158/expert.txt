-----Input----- The first line contains an integer N. Then N lines follow. Each line has the name Si of the menu and its price Pi separated by a single space. -----Output----- Print the number of menus whose prices are one of Ciel numbers. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 1 ≤ |Si| ≤ 100, where |Si| denotes the length of Si Each letter of Si is either an alphabetical letter or a digit or a single quotation mark or a space. 1 ≤ Pi < 1000000 (106) Pi contains no leading zeros. -----Sample Input----- 6 milk 58 Ciel's Drink 80 The curry 2nd edition 888888 rice omelet 85855 unagi 1 The first    and last letters can be a space    358 -----Sample Output----- 3 -----Output details----- 58 and 888888 and 358 are Ciel numbers. 80 and 85855 and 1 are not Ciel numbers. -----Notes----- Different operating systems have different ways of representing a newline; do not assume one particular way will be used.
