 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $m$ worms. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum number of worms that may be eaten in first postion after $m$ days. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of piles. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} ≤ 10^6), where a_{i} is the number of worms in the i-th pile. The third line contains single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot. The fourth line contains m integers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{m} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n}), the labels of the juicy worms. -----Output----- Print m lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where the worm labeled with the number q_{i} is. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 7 3 4 9 3 1 25 11 Output 1 5 3 -----Note----- For the sample input:   The worms with labels from [1, 2] are in the first pile.  The worms with labels from [3, 9] are in the second pile.  The worms with labels from [10, 12] are in the third pile.  The worms with labels from [13, 16] are in the fourth pile.  The worms with labels from [17, 25] are in the fifth pile.
