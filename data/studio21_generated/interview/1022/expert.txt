 You are given two cities. The cities are directly connected. Return the lengths of all roads.   Example 1: Input:  cities = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]],  A = 3 Output: 3 Explanation:  The length of road is 3.   Example 2: Input:  cities = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]],  A = 4 Output
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. For each valid $i$, $A_i = -1$ denotes that the length of road $i$ is unknown. -----Output----- For each test case, print a line containing the string "NO" if there is no solution or "YES" otherwise. If a solution exists, print a second line containing $N$ space-separated positive integers â€” the lengths of all roads in your solution. Each of these integers should be $\le 10^9$. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $3 \le N \le 10^5$ - $1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ or $A_i = -1$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ for all test cases does not exceed $3\cdot 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (10 points): $N \le 4$ Subtask #2 (20 points): $A_i = \pm 1$ for each valid $i$ Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 4 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 2 4 1 -1 -1 4 4 1 -1 2 -1 -----Example Output----- YES 1 1 1 1 NO YES 1 4 1 4 NO
