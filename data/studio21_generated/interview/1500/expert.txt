 The input given is a valid parentheses sequence. You need to output a string which will replace the original one. 
-----Input----- 	The first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process. 	The only line of each testcase contains one string A denoting Mike's parentheses sequence. It is guaranteed that A only consists of the characters '(' and ')'. It is also guaranteed that A is a valid parentheses sequence. -----Output----- 	The output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. The only line of each testcase should contain one string B denoting the valid parentheses sequence that should be chosen by Mike to replace A. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 5; 1 ≤ |A| ≤ 100000(105). -----Example----- Input: 1 ()((()())) Output: ((()))
