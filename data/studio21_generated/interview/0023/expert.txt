 You are given $n$ voters. For each of them, you have two possible methods: (1) Pay him coins (2) Make other voters vote for him ($m_i = 1$ if voter $i$ votes for you and $m_i = 0$ if voter $i$ does not vote for you). There are $n$ voters. For each of them, you have two possible methods: (1) Pay him coins (2) Make other voters vote for him ($m_i = 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 5000$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5000$) — the number of voters. The next $n$ lines contains the description of voters. $i$-th line contains two integers $m_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^9, 0 \le m_i < n$). It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5000$. -----Output----- For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you. -----Example----- Input 3 3 1 5 2 10 2 8 7 0 1 3 1 1 1 6 1 1 1 4 1 4 1 6 2 6 2 3 2 8 2 7 4 4 5 5 Output 8 0 7 -----Note----- In the first test case you have to buy vote of the third voter. Then the set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${3} \rightarrow {1, 3} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3}$. In the second example you don't need to buy votes. The set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${1} \rightarrow {1, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}$. In the third test case you have to buy votes of the second and the fifth voters. Then the set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${2, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$.
