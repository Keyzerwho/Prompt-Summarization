 You are given four dishes: salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. The dishes of consecutive days must be different. The dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. You are given some period. You need to calculate how many schedules exist. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains a single integer N denoting the number of days for which the schedule should be made. -----Output----- For each test case output a single integer in a separate line, the answer for the corresponding test case. -----Constraints-----1 ≤ T ≤ 100 2 ≤ N ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 3 2 3 5 Output: 12 24 240 -----Explanation----- Case 1. For N = 2 days we have the following 12 schedules: First day Second day  salo   borsch    salo   varenyky    salo   galushky    borsch   salo    borsch   varenyky    borsch   galushky    varenyky   salo    varenyky   borsch    varenyky   galushky    galushky   salo    galushky   borsch    galushky   varenyky   Case 2. For N = 3 we have the following 24 schedules: First daySecond dayThird day  salo   borsch   varenyky    salo   borsch   galushky    salo   varenyky   borsch    salo   varenyky   galushky    salo   galushky   borsch    salo   galushky   varenyky    borsch   salo   varenyky    borsch   salo   galushky    borsch   varenyky   salo    borsch   varenyky   galushky    borsch   galushky   salo    borsch   galushky   varenyky    varenyky   salo   borsch    varenyky   salo   galushky    varenyky   borsch   salo    varenyky   borsch   galushky    varenyky   galushky   salo    varenyky   galushky   borsch    galushky   salo   borsch    galushky   salo   varenyky    galushky   borsch   salo    galushky   borsch   varenyky    galushky   varenyky   salo    galushky   varenyky   borsch   Case 3. Don't be afraid. This time we will not provide you with a table of 240 schedules. The only thing we want to mention here is that apart from the previous two cases schedules for other values of N can have equal dishes (and even must have for N > 4). For example the schedule (salo, borsch, salo, borsch) is a correct schedule for N = 4 while the schedule (varenyky, salo, galushky, verynky, salo) is a correct schedule for N = 5.
