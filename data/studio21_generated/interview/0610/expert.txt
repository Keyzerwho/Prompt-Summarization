 Given $N$ spots numbered $1$ through $N$, determine if people are following social distancing advice or not. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if social distancing is being followed or "NO" otherwise (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N \le 100$ - $0 \le A_i \le 1$ for each valid $i$ - at least one spot is occupied -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 3 1 0 1 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 11 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 -----Example Output----- NO YES NO -----Explanation----- Example case 1: The first and third spots are occupied and the distance between them is $2$ feet. Example case 2: The first and seventh spots are occupied and the distance between them is $6$ feet.
