 You're given an array of integers. You need to find the number of scholarships offered. 
-----Input:----- - The first line will contain a single integer, $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - The first line of each test case contains four integers; $N$, $R$, $|X|$ and $|Y|$ denoting the number of participants, maximum number of scholarships offered, number of old participants, and the number of participants involved in plagiarism, respectively. - The second line of each test case contains $|X|$ space separated integers $x_1, x_2 \ldots x_{|X|}$ denoting the indices of people who participated in previous years. If $X$ is empty, this line is skipped and no empty line is in the input. - The third line of each test case contains $|Y|$ space separated integers $y_1, y_2 \ldots y_{|Y|}$  denoting the indices of people who are involved in plagiarism. If $Y$ is empty, this line is skipped and no empty line is in input. -----Output:----- For each testcase, print a single integer in a new line, denoting the number of participants who shall get the scholarship. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^{15}$ - $0 \leq R \leq 10^{15}$ - $0 \leq |X|, |Y| \leq min(N, 2*10^5)$ - $1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq N$ - All $x_i$ are distinct - All $y_i$ are distinct - Sum of $|X|$ over all test cases does not exceed $5*10^5$ - Sum of $|Y|$ over all test cases does not exceed $5*10^5$ -----Subtasks----- - 20 points : $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$, and the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $3*10^3$ - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 2*10^5$, and the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5*10^5$ - 50 points: Original constraints -----Sample Input:----- 3 5 3 0 1 4 10 2 4 6 3 1 7 6 4 3 1 5 9 7 10 4 4 6 3 1 7 6 4 3 1 5 9 7 -----Sample Output:----- 3 2 3 -----EXPLANATION:----- - In the first testcase, only participant $4$ is involved in plagiarism, and thus not eligible for the scholarship. No user has participated in previous years, and so no empty line is there in the sample. All participants except participant $4$ are eligible for the scholarship, but only three of them get it because $R = 3$. - Both second and third testcases are the same, except for $R$. In both samples, only participants $2$, $8$ and $10$ are eligible for scholarships. - In the second testcase, since the maximum number of scholarships is $2$, only $2$ participants get scholarships. - In the third testcase, all three eligible participants get scholarships.
