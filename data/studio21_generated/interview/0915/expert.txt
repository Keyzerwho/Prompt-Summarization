 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. - First line will contain a single integer denoting n. - Second line will contain n space separated integers where ith integer corresponds to the day dith as given in the problem. -----Output----- Print a single line corresponding to the answer of the problem. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 104 - 1 ≤ n  ≤ 50 - 1 ≤ di ≤ 100 -----Example----- Input: 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 Output: 2 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Devu can give party to second friend on day 2 and first friend on day 3, so he can save both his friendships. Example case 2. Both the friends want a party on day 1, and as the Devu can not afford more than one party a day, so he can save only one of the friendships, so answer is 1.
