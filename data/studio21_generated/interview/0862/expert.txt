  Given an integer n and an integer k, calculate how many jars of cow's milk Dhoni and Sir Jadeja will get.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. -  The first line of each test case contains integer N , M, K denoting the number of milk jars, maximum number of time Dhoni will drink from any jar and maximum amount of milk Dhoni will drink at any time respectively. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the amount of milk in each jar.  -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single line containing the amount of milk Sir Jadega will get modulo 1,000,000,007. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤  10  - 1 ≤ N ≤  10^5  - 0 ≤ M ≤  10^6  - 1 ≤ K ≤  10^6  - 0 ≤ Ai ≤  10^9  -----Example----- Input: 1 3 3 3 15 8 10 Output: 9
