 You are given $N$ students, $N$ friends and $M$ facts.  You need to output the number of ways in which two students can be selected in such a way that they are not friends. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain two integers $N$ and $M$.  - Then $M$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ denoting the students who are friends. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output the number of ways in which  two students can be selected in such a way that they are friends. -----Constraints----- - $2 \leq N \leq 200000$ - $0 \leq M \leq 200000$ - $1 \leq A_i,B_i \leq N$ -----Sample Input:----- 5 3 1 2                                                    3 4 1 5 -----Sample Output:----- 6 -----EXPLANATION:----- Groups of friend are $[1,2,5]$ and $[3,4]$.Hence the answer is  3 X 2 =6.
