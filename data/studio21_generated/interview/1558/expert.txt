 Anas is playing a game on a grid with $N$ rows and $M$ columns. The rows are numbered $1$ through $N$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ through $M$ from left to right. Anas wants to destroy this grid. To do that, he wants to send two heroes from the top left cell to the bottom right cell: - The first hero visits cells in row-major order: $(1,1) \rightarrow (1,2) \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow (1,M) \rightarrow (2,1) \rightarrow
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing $N \cdot M$ space-separated integers as described above. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $2 \le N, M \le 1,000$ - the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): - $2 \le N, M \le 50$ - the sum of $N \cdot M$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000$ Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 2 3 -----Example Output----- 6 4 3 3 2 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: - $K = 0$: All cells will be destroyed by the heroes. - $K = 1$: The first hero will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (1,3), (2,2)]$, while the second one will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]$. - $K = 2$: The first hero will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (2,1)]$, while the second one will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (2,2)]$. - $K = 3$: The first hero will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (2,2)]$, while the second one will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (1,3)]$. - $K = 4$: The first hero will destroy the cells $[(1,1), (2,3)]$ and the second one will also destroy the cells $[(1,1), (2,3)]$. - $K = 5$ : The first hero will destroy the cell $(1,1)$ and the second one will also destroy the cell $(1,1)$.
