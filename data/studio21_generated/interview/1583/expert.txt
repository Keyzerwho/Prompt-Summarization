 You are given an integer $n$ and an integer $x$. The input consists of 2 lines. First line contains an integer $n$ and second line contains an integer $x$. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows." - The first line of each test case contains seven space separated integers n, sx, sy , ex, ey, bx, by.  -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to minimum number of moves Jerry needs. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 2 ≤ n ≤ 20 -  1 ≤ sx, sy , ex, ey, bx, by ≤ n  - No two or more poitns in the three points are same. -----Example----- Input: 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 1 1 3 1 2 Output: 2 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. ... Jerry will move directly (1, 1) to (2, 1) and then to (2, 2) in total 2 moves. Example case 2. ...
