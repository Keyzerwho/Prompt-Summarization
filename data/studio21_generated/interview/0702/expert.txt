 You are given two tanks with initial temperatures $Tc$ and $Th$. There is a pipe between them. The pipe allows flow of water between them. The water changes the temperature of both tanks. The tank with higher temperature becomes lower and tank with lower temperature becomes higher. You need to predict whether pipe will burst after $m$ minutes. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, three  integers $m, Tc,Th$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer "Yes" if Pipe will burst after m minutes "No" if pipe will not burst. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100000$ - $1 \leq m,Tc,Th \leq 10^9$ - $Tc \leq Th $ -----Sample Input:----- 2 4 5 10 2 2 5 -----Sample Output:----- Yes No
