 Given an integer array A, and an integer target, return the number of tuples i, j, k  such that i < j < k and A[i] + A[j] + A[k] == target. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.  Enumerating by the values (A[i], A[j], A[k]): (1, 2, 5) occurs 8 times; (1, 3, 4) occurs 8 times; (2
