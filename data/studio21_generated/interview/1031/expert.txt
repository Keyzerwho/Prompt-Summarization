 You are given hypotenuse H and area S. You need to find a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow. For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S. -----Output----- Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ H ≤ 106 - 1 ≤ S ≤ 1012 -----Example----- Input:4 5 6 6 10 258303 89837245228 616153 77878145466 Output:3.00000 4.00000 5.00000 -1 -1 285168.817674 546189.769984 616153.000000
