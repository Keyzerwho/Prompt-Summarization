 you are given a list of toys. Each toy represents a real number. Determine which boxes can be the special box after Chaneka found her super toy. Example 1: Input: toys = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[2,2],[2,3],[3,3]], 1 <= toys.length <= 100 toys[i].length == 2 -10^4 <= toys[i][0], toys[i][1]
-----Input----- The first line has an integer $T$ $(1 \le T \le 5 \cdot 10^4)$, the number of test cases. Every case contains a line with four space-separated integers $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$ $(0 \le A, B, C, D \le 10^6, A + B + C + D > 0)$, which denotes the number of toys in the first, second, third, and fourth box, respectively. -----Output----- For each case, print four space-separated strings. Each string represents the possibility that the first, second, third, and fourth box can be the special box from left to right. For each box, print "Ya" (Without quotes, Indonesian for yes) if that box can be the special box. Print "Tidak" (Without quotes, Indonesian for No) otherwise. -----Example----- Input 2 1 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 Output Ya Ya Tidak Tidak Tidak Ya Tidak Tidak -----Note----- For the first case, here is a scenario where the first box is the special box:   The first box had toys with fun values $\{-3\}$.  The second box had toys with fun values $\{ -0.5, -0.5 \}$  The fourth box had toys with fun values $\{ 3 \}$  The sewing sequence:   Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-0.5$ and $-0.5$ to a toy with fun $0.25$ and then put it in the third box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-3$ and $0.25$ to a toy with fun $-0.75$ and then put it in the second box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-0.75$ and $3$ to a toy with fun $-1.25$ and then put it in the first box, which then became the special box.  Here is a scenario where the second box ends up being the special box:   The first box had toys with fun values $\{-3\}$  The second box had toys with fun values $\{ -0.33, -0.25 \}$.  The fourth box had toys with fun values $\{ 3 \}$.  The sewing sequence:   Chaneka sews the toy with fun $-3$ and $-0.33$ to a toy with fun $0.99$ and then put it in the third box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $0.99$ and $3$ to a toy with fun $2.97$ and then put in it the fourth box.  Chaneka sews the toy with fun $2.97$ and $-0.25$ to a toy with fun $-0.7425$ and then put it in the second box, which then became the special box.  There is only one toy for the second case, so Chaneka does not have to sew anything because that toy, by definition, is the super toy.
