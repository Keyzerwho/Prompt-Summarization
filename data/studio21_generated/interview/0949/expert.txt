 You are given N integers $a[1], a[2], ..... a[N]$  written on his magical stick.The password is the maximum number of moves Fizza can perform, for any position $i$ such that 1 < = $i$ < = $N$ and integer $X$ is present at $i$-th position. In one move she can perform one of the following operations -> $(1)$  If ( $i$ + 1 < = $N$ ) she can go to position 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase consists of  two lines of input. - Input $N$. - Input $N$ integers .  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line Maximum number of moves. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq a[i] \leq 2*10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 8 6 3 6 4 5 4 3 6 9 5 5 4 5 2 1 3 4 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 -----Sample Output:----- 1 2 0 -----EXPLANATION:----- In the first case, integers at position 1 and 3 are the same and at alternate positions. In the second case, integers at position 1, 2, 4 follow the conditions.
