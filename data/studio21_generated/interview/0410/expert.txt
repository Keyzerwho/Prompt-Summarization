 Given three integers lo, hi and k. The task is to sort all integers in the interval [lo, hi] by the power value in ascending order, if two or more integers have the same power value sort them by ascending order. Return the k-th integer in the range [lo, hi] sorted by the power value. Notice that for any integer x (lo <= x <= hi) it is guaranteed that x will transform into 1 using these steps and that the power of x is will fit in 32 bit signed integer.   Example 1: Input: lo = 12, hi
