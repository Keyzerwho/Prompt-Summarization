 You are given N numbers with attractiveness attached to each number. You need to find minimum velocity at the first segment to satisfy all conditions. -----Constraints-----  - 1 N 10^7  - 1 x < y N  - x, y are integers.  - 1 x_i, y_i 10^9  - 1 x < y N  - x_i, y_i are integers.  - 1 x_i, y_i 10^9
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments. The second line contains N space-separated integers W1, W2, ..., WN denoting the attractiveness of shops.  -----Output----- - For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal possible velocity at the beginning. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 - 1 ≤ Wi ≤ 10^6 -----Example----- Input: 2 5 6 5 4 3 2 5 3 4 3 1 1 Output: 6 5 -----Explanation----- Example case 1.  If we choose velocity 6, on the first step we have 6 >= 6 everything is OK, then we should decrease the velocity to 5 and on the 2nd segment we'll receive 5 >= 5, again OK, and so on.  Example case 2.  If we choose velocity 4, the promanade will be ruined on the 2nd step (we sould decrease our velocity, so the maximal possible will be 3 which is less than 4).
