 You are given an integer $N$, an integer $S$, and an integer $v$. You need to return the number of coins needed to pay $S$. Example 1: Input: N = 5, S = 5, v = 4 Output: 1 Example 2: Input: N = 6, S = 5, v = 3 Output: 1 Example 3: Input: N = 7, S = 6, v = 4 Output: 1
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $S$ and $N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum number of coins. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10,000$ - $1 \le S \le 10^9$ - $2 \le N \le 10^9$ - $N$ is even -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 4 2 2 1 14 30 10 31 4 -----Example Output----- 1 1 3 9 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: One coin with value $2$ is sufficient. Example case 2: We need to use one coin with value $1$. Example case 3: We need $3$ coins, each with value $10$. Example case 4: We can use seven coins with value $4$, one coin with value $2$ and one coin with value $1$.
