 You are given two integers N and L. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $T$ $(1 \le T \le 10^5)$ denotes the number of test cases. The next $T$ lines each contain a single integer $N$ $(1 \le N \le 10^{18})$. -----Output----- $T$ lines, each line is the answer requested by Mr. Chanek. -----Example----- Input 2 5 6 Output 2 4 -----Note----- For the first case, the game is as follows:   Mr. Chanek takes one coin.  The opponent takes two coins.  Mr. Chanek takes one coin.  The opponent takes one coin.  For the second case, the game is as follows:   Mr. Chanek takes three coins.  The opponent takes one coin.
