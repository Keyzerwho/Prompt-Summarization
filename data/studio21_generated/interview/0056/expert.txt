 You are given integers $n,k$. Construct a grid $A$ with size $n \times n$ consisting of integers $0$ and $1$. The very important condition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly $k$. In other words, the number of $1$ in the grid is equal to $k$. Let's define:  $A_{i,j}$ as the integer in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.  $R_i = A_{i,1}+A_{i
-----Input----- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Next $t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. For each test case the only line contains two integers $n$, $k$ $(1 \le n \le 300, 0 \le k \le n^2)$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ for all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, firstly print the minimum possible value of $f(A)$ among all tables, for which the condition is satisfied. After that, print $n$ lines contain $n$ characters each. The $j$-th character in the $i$-th line should be equal to $A_{i,j}$. If there are multiple answers you can print any. -----Example----- Input 4 2 2 3 8 1 0 4 16 Output 0 10 01 2 111 111 101 0 0 0 1111 1111 1111 1111 -----Note----- In the first test case, the sum of all elements in the grid is equal to $2$, so the condition is satisfied. $R_1 = 1, R_2 = 1$ and $C_1 = 1, C_2 = 1$. Then, $f(A) = (1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 0$, which is the minimum possible value of $f(A)$. In the second test case, the sum of all elements in the grid is equal to $8$, so the condition is satisfied. $R_1 = 3, R_2 = 3, R_3 = 2$ and $C_1 = 3, C_2 = 2, C_3 = 3$. Then, $f(A) = (3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2 = 2$. It can be proven, that it is the minimum possible value of $f(A)$.
