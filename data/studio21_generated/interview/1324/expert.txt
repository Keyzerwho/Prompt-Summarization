 You are given an array consisting of n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty. Each step you selects a non-empty array cell with the maximum index and moves the number written in it to the nearest empty cell to the left of the selected one. The process continues until all n numbers will appear in the first n cells of the array. For example if n = 4, the array is changing as follows: [Image]  You have to write a program that allows you to determine the $gc
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase consists of a single line of input, which has two integers: $N, K$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum gcd or -1. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $1 \leq N, K \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 6 3 -----Sample Output:----- 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- The only possible distribution is $[1, 2, 3]$. So the answer is 1.
