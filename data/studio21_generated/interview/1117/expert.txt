 You are given N$N$ players participating in this competition, numbered 1$1$ through N$N$. Initially, the skill level of each player is zero. There are also M$M$ challenges (numbered 1$1$ through M$M$). For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th challenge has three parameters Li$L_i$, Ri$R_i$ and Xi$X_i$ with the following meaning: for each player between the Li$L_i$-th and Ri$R_
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and Q$Q$. - M$M$ lines follow. For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Li$L_i$, Ri$R_i$ and Xi$X_i$. - Q$Q$ more lines follow. For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Ai$A_i$ and Bi$B_i$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing N$N$ space-separated integers. For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th of these integers should denote the maximum skill level of the i$i$-th player. -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤1,000$1 \le T \le 1,000$ - 1≤N≤100,000$1 \le N \le 100,000$ - 1≤M≤1,000$1 \le M \le 1,000$ - 1≤Q≤10,000$1 \le Q \le 10,000$ - 1≤Li≤Ri≤N$1 \le L_i \le R_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$ - 1≤Ai≤Bi≤M$1 \le A_i \le B_i \le M$ for each valid i$i$ - |Xi|≤1,000,000$|X_i| \le 1,000,000$ for each valid i$i$ - the sum of N$N$ over all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000$1,000,000$ - the sum of M$M$ over all test cases does not exceed 5,000$5,000$ - the sum of Q$Q$ over all test cases does not exceed 50,000$50,000$ -----Example Input----- 1 5 3 4 1 1 3 1 2 -4 4 5 2 1 2 1 3 1 1 2 3 -----Example Output----- 3 0 0 4 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: - The first player will select the 3$3$-rd compo. - The second and third players will not select any compo. - The fourth player will select the 1$1$-st, 2$2$-nd and 4$4$-th compos. - The fifth player will select all the compos.
