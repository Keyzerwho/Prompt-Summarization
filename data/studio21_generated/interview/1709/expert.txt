 Given an array of positive or negative integers   I= [i1,..,in] you have to produce a sorted array P of the form  [ [p, sum of all ij of I for which p is a prime factor (p positive) of ij] ...] P will be sorted by increasing order of the prime numbers. The final result has to be given as a string in Java, C#, C, C++ and as an array of arrays in other languages. Example: ```python I = [12, 15] # result = [[2, 12], [3
