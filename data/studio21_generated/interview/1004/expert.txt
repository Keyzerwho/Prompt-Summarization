 You are given a square hoverboard with $n$ soldiers on it. Split it into $k$ smaller square boards.   Example: Input: n = 4, k = 2 Output: 2 Explanation: Split the board into two smaller boards {[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3]}.   Note: 1 <= n <= 200 1 <= k <= n
-----Input----- A single integer N denoting the side length of the big hoverboard. -----Output----- In the first line, output the integer 'k' which is the minimum number of square boards into which the bigger board can be split up. In the second line, output k space separated integers which denote the sizes of the smaller square hoverboards.This must be in increasing order of sizes. -----Constraints----- N ranges from 2 to 50. -----Example----- Input: 3 Output: 6 1 1 1 1 1 2 -----Explanation----- A square of side length 3 can be split into smaller squares in two ways: Either into 9 squares of side1 or 5 squares of side 1 and 1 square of size 2.The second case is the favourable one.
