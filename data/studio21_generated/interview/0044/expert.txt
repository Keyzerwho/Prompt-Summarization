 You are given $n$ kids, and $4n$ chairs. Two kids can't sit on the same chair. The teacher really doesn't want the mess at the table, so she wants to seat the kids so there are no $2$ of the kid that can indulge. More formally, she wants no pair of chairs $a$ and $b$ that the kids occupy to fulfill the condition above. Since the teacher is very busy with the entertainment of the kids, she asked you to solve this problem.
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$) — the number of kids. -----Output----- Output $t$ lines, which contain $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $4n$ — the numbers of chairs that the kids should occupy in the corresponding test case. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. You can print $n$ numbers in any order. -----Example----- Input 3 2 3 4 Output 6 4 4 6 10 14 10 12 8
