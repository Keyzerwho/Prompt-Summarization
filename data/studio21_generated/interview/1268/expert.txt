 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or
Note: $\left \lfloor a \right \rfloor$ denotes the floor($a$). -----Input----- - Each case contains three space-separated positive integers $n$, $m$ and $x$ where $n, x \leq 1000$ and $m \leq 10^{15}$.  - End of input is determined by three zeros.  - There are no more than 1000 test cases. -----Output----- - For each case, output in a single line the total unit of money the library gets in that day. -----Sample Input----- 1 100 9 11 2 10 12 2 11 0 0 0 -----Sample Output----- 9 15 16 -----Explanation:----- Testcase 2: Here, $n=11$, $m=2$, $x=10$. For 1st person,  $t=21$ and he/she gives $\left \lfloor \frac{21-11}{2} \right \rfloor = 5$ units of money. For 2nd person, $t=32$ and he/she gives $\left \lfloor \frac{32-11}{2} \right \rfloor= 10$ units of money. So, total units of money $= 5+10 = 15$
