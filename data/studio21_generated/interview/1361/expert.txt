     You are given $n$ integers $A[1], A[2] ..... A[n]$ and a number $k$. You have to apply $A[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} A[j]$ on the array $k$ times. Finally, you have to apply $modulo$ $(10^9 + 7)$ operation to each element of the array. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input:----- - First line of the input consists of two space separated integers $n$ and $k$.  - Second line contains $n$ space separated integers $A[1] .. A[n]$. -----Output:----- In a single line print $n$ space separated integers, the values of the resultant array after applying all the operations. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq n \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq k \leq 10^{12}$ - $1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- - 20 Points: $1 \leq k \leq 1000$ - 30 Points: $1 \leq k \leq 1000000$ - 50 Points: Original Constraints -----Sample Input:----- $4$ $2$ $3$ $4$ $1$ $5$ -----Sample Output:----- $3$ $10$ $18$ $31$ -----EXPLANATION:----- After applying the prefix sum operation once the array becomes -> $3$ $7$ $8$ $13$ After applying the prefix sum operation for the second time, the array becomes -> $3$ $10$ $18$ $31$ After applying $modulo$ $(10^9 +7)$ operation, array becomes -> $3$ $10$ $18$ $31$
