 you wants to get from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ by making multiple hops. you can only hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its $n$ favorite numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. What is the minimum number of hops you need to move from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ you can only hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its $n
