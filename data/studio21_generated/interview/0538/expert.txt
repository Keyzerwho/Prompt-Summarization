 You are given numbers SG and FG. You are given an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s. Return the speed of the other car accurately. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  Each of the next T lines contain five space separated integers S, SG, FG, D, T corresponding to the Sebi's car speed, Sebi's guess, his father's guess, D as defined in the statement and the time at which both the cars at against the markers (in seconds), respectively. -----Output----- Output description. For each test case, output a single line containing "SEBI", "FATHER" or "DRAW" (without quotes) denoting whose guess is better. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000 - 0 ≤ S ≤ 130 - 0 ≤ SG, FG ≤ 300 - 1 ≤ D ≤ 30 - 1 ≤ T ≤ 300 -  The other car speed doesn't exceed 300 kph. -----Example----- Input: 2 100 180 200 20 60 130 131 132 1 72 Output: SEBI FATHER -----Explanation----- Example case 1. There are total 20 - 1 = 19 markers in between the Sebi's car and the other car. So, the distance between those cars at time T is 20 * 50 = 1000 meters = 1 km. As T = 60 seconds, i.e. 1 minutes. So, the other car goes 1 km more than Sebi's car in 1 minute. So, the other car will go 60 km more than Sebi's car in 1 hour. So, its speed is 60 kmph more than Sebi's car, i.e. 160 kmph. Sebi had made a guess of 180 kmph, while his father of 200 kmph. Other car's real speed is 160 kmph. So, Sebi's guess is better than his father. Hence he wins the game. Example case 2. The situation of this example is depicted in the image provided in the statement. You can find the speed of other car and see that Father's guess is more accurate.
