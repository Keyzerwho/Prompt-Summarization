 You are given a list of $N$ events with their start time $S_i$,end time $E_i$ and preferred room $P_i$,you need to calculate the maximum number of events that can take place. Note that the $i$th event wants to occupy the $p_i$ room from [$s_i$, $f_i$) . 
-----Input:----- The first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases . Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $N$ and $K$ , the number of events and the number of rooms respectively . Each of the next $N$ lines contains three integers $s_i$ ,$e_i$ and $p_i$,the start time ,end time and the preferred room of ith event. -----Output:----- Print the maximum number of events that can take place. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq  K \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq  Si <  Ei \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq Pi \leq K$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 4 2 1 10 1 10 20 2 15 50 2 20 30 2 -----Sample Output:----- 3 -----EXPLANATION:----- Chef can allow events 1st ,2nd and 4th,to get the maximum 3.
