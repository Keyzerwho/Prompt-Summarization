 You are given a positive integer $t$. You are also given $N$ countries $1, 2, \ldots, N$, with populations $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$. Each country has $x$ cures ready. On each day, Chef can supply twice the number of cures that were delivered (i.e. people that were cured) on the previous day. Chef cannot supply leftovers from the previous or any earlier day, as the cures expire in a day. The number of cures delivered to some country on some day cannot exceed the number of infected people it currently has, either.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $x$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum number of days. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^3$ - $1 \le N \le 10^5$ - $1 \le a_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - $1 \le x \le 10^9$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): $a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_N$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 40 30 20 10 50 3 10 20 1 110 -----Example Output----- 5 9 6
