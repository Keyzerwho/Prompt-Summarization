 You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. Example 1: Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1 Output: 6 Explanation: There are 6 possible combinations. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]
