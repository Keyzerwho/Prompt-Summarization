You are given two positive integers — A and B — in 7-ary system such that B * C = A and  B is a divisor of A. Calculate the number C modulo 7L.

-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer T — the number of test cases. T tests follow.

For each test case, the first line contains the integer A, and the second line contains the integer B, and the third line contains the integer L. A and B are given in 7-ary system.
