Calculate the number C modulo 7L. Input: First line of input contains an integer T — the number of test cases. T tests follow. For each test case, the first line contains the integer A, and the second line contains the integer B, and the third line contains the integer L. A and B are given in 7-ary system. Output: Output the answer in 7-ary system. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - A and B are both positive integers. - Length of A is a positive integer and doesn't exceed 106. - L and length of B are positive integers and do not exceed 10000. Example: Input:3 21 5 10 202 13 1 202 13 2 Output:3 3 13
