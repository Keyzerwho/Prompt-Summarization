Given a set of n numbers, divide them into subsets of sizes at most different by 1, such that difference in the sum of numbers in each subset is minimum.

-----Input-----
First line consists of an integer n which denotes the size of the set. Second line is the set.

-----Output-----
The first line is the first subset.
The second line is the second subset.

-----Constraints-----
n can range from 2 to 99. The numbers may vary from 1 to 10^4.

-----Example-----
Input:
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Output:
1 2 4 7
3 5 6

-----Explanation-----
These 7 values must be separated into 2 sets of sizes 3 and 4.In this case, it is possible to form two sets (1,2,4,7) & (3,5,6) of equal size.The set containing the first value (i.e.) and the elements of the output sets have the same order as the input.
