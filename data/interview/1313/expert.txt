You are given an array A that consists of N positive integers.

Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A. 
If such number does not exist, output -1.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of the array A for the corresponding test case. The second line contains N space separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].

-----Output-----

For each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
1 ≤ T ≤ 100000

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

The sum of values of N in each test file does not exceed 100000

1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100000

i>0
