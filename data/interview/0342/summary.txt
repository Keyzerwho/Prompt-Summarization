Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it.
Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s.
You may assume the following rules:


You receive a valid 2 dimentional array, made of only structures or empty
slots.  Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. 
At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two structures.


Example:
X..X
...X
...X

In the above 2 dimentional array there are 2 structures.

Invalid Example:
...X
XXXX
...X

This is an invalid 2 dimentional array that you will not receive - as structures
will always have a cell separating between them.
