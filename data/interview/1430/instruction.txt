You are given $N$ nodes arranged in a cycle initialised to zero and a difference $K$. 
Find and return the minimum number of increments required so that each node is atleast $1$ and adjacent nodes have a difference of is atleast $K$.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The only line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of increments you need.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq  10^6$
- $2 \leq  N \leq  10^3$
- $0 \leq  K \leq 10^4$ 

-----Sample Input:-----
1 
2 1

-----Sample Output:-----
3

-----EXPLANATION:-----
The minimum number of increments required is $3$. One node needs to be incremented once and the other node needs to be incremented $2$ times.
