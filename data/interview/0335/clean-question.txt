You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.  The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side.  Each steel support must be an equal height.You have a collection of rods which can be welded together.  For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation.  If you cannot support the billboard, return 0. Example 1:Input: 1,2,3,6Output: 6Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.Example 2:Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6Output: 10Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.Example 3:Input: 1,2Output: 0Explanation: The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0. Note:0 <= rods.length <= 201 <= rodsi <= 1000The sum of rods is at most 5000.
