You are given a positive integer N.Find how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) are there such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. Input: The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly one line containing an integer N. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 (105) - 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 (104) Output: For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs (p, q) of primes such that N = p + 2q. Example: Input: 3 2 7 11 Output: 0 1 2
