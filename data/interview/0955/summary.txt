In this problem, given a positive integer N. Your task is to calculate how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

Each test case consists of exactly one line containing an integer N.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 (105)
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 (104)

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the number of ordered pairs (p, q) of primes such that N = p + 2q.

-----Example-----
Input:
3
2
7
11

Output:
0
1
2

-----Explanation-----
Case #1: There are no ordered pairs (p, q) such that p + 2q = 2.
Case #2: There is only one ordered pair (p, q) = (3, 2) such that p + 2q = 7.
Case #3: There are two ordered pairs (p, q) = (7, 2), (5, 3) such that p + 2q = 11.
