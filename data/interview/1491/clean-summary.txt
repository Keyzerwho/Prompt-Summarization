You are given four numbers x, y, z, w which make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. You have to check that if it is possible to shuffle x, y, z, w to make some proportion or not. Input: Only line of the input contains four space separated positive integers - a, b, c, d. Output: Print "Possible" if it is possible to shuffle a, b, c, d to make proportion, otherwise "Impossible" (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 1000 Example: Input: 1 2 4 2 Output: Possible
