The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$. Output: For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if all people can be served or "NO" otherwise (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N \le 10^3$ - $a_i \in \{5, 10, 15\}$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (40 points): $a_i \in \{5, 10\}$ for each valid $i$ Subtask #2 (60 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 2 5 10 2 10 5 2 5 15 -----Example Output----- YES NO NO
