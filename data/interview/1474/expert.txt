Write a code to search for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X in given different numbers. 

-----Input-----
First Line contains number of test cases T. First Line of each test case contains N. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,....,AN. Where Ai integer indicates ith number. Next Line contains digit X.

-----Output-----
Output the number which is having maximum frequency of digit X. If two or more numbers are having same maximum frequency then output the first occurred number among them in A1,A2,A3,....,AN

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 30
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10200
- 0 ≤ X ≤ 9

-----Example-----
Input:
2
5
345 1323 165 98 456
3
5
335 876 98 1323 349
3

Output:
1323
335
