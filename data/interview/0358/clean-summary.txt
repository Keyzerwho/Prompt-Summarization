You are given following inputs: original string S, starting index i, source word x and target word y. You need to perform replacement operations with this rule: If x starts at position i in S, you need to replace that occurrence of x with y. If not, we do nothing. All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = 0, 1, sources = "ab","bc" is not a valid test case. Consider: 0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100 0 < indexesi < S.length <= 1000 All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters. Example 1: Input: S = "abcd", indexes = 0,2, sources = "a","cd", targets = "eee","ffff" Output: "eeebffff" Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee". "cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff". Example 2: Input: S = "abcd", indexes = 0,2, sources = "ab","ec", targets = "eee","ffff" Output: "eeecd" Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee". "ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.
