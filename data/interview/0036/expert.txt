Marmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile contains a_{i} worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a_1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers a_1 + 1 to a_1 + a_2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding.

Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of piles.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3, a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n} ≤ 10^6), where a_{i} is the number of worms in the i-th pile.

The third line contains single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot.

The fourth line contains m integers q_1, q_2, ..., q_{m} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_{n}), the labels of the juicy worms.


-----Output-----

Print m lines to the standard output. The i-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where the worm labeled with the number q_{i} is.
