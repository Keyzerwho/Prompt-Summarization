You are given $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes. Input: - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$. - $N$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers $S_i$ and $J_i$. Output: For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N \le 100$ - $1 \le S_i \le J_i \le 300$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 5 1 3 4 4 4 10 1 11 2 7 -----Example Output----- 2
