The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.
  
You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution?

-----Input-----

The first line of input will contain the number of villages V (1 ≤ V ≤ 100). The following V lines each describe one village. The description of each village consists of 250 space-separated integers k, drawn from one of the above distributions.


-----Output-----

Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The village's line shall state poisson if the village's distribution is of the Poisson type, and uniform if the answer came from a uniform distribution.
