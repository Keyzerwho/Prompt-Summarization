You are given a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. There will be a collison if two boys like the same girl. Calculate the number of different collisions Input: The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively. Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'. Output: For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10 Example: Input: 2 4 3 111 100 110 000 2 2 10 01 Output: 4 0
