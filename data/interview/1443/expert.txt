Calculate the number of different collisions if a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls are given where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0 and collison occurs when two boys like the same girl. 

-----Input-----
The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively.
Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'.

-----Output-----
For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10
