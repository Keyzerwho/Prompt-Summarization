You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag.
There should be atleast K balloons of same color in each withdrawal.
Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least k balloons of same color.



-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a three space-separated integers R, G and B. 

The second line contains only one integer K.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of balloons need to take out from the bag.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ R, G, B ≤ 109
- 1 ≤ K ≤ max{R, G, B}


-----Example-----
Input:
2
3 3 3
