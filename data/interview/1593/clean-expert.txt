You are given sum of Rs. N as input, Find smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N if there are denominations notes of Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. Input: The first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N. Output: For each test case, display the smallest number of notes that will combine to give N, in a new line. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000 Example: Input 3 1200 500 242 Output 12 5 7
