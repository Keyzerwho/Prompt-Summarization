Given a message containing English letters(A-Z), it is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1,'B' -> 2 ……………… 'Z' -> 26. Determine the total number of ways to decode it. While decoding you need to choose a substring of characters and not a subsequence. Also a chosen substring should not contain any leading "0"s, but can contain trailing "0"s.Print the answer as modulo 10^9 + 7 i.e 1000000007. -----Input:----- The first line of the input consists of single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a string. -----Output:----- For each test case print a single integer - the total number of ways to decode the digit string. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $2 \leq S \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 12 226 -----Sample Output:----- 2 3
