Find the factorial of each number from 1 to given positive integer n. Input: First line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The next T lines contain an integer N. Output: For each test case, print a single line containing the solution to the spell which is equal to factorial of N, i.e. N!. Since the output could be large, output it modulo 1589540031. Example: Input: 4 1 2 3 4 Output: 1 2 6 24
