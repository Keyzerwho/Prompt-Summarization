You are given a point P(0,0). You have to find the distance between P and other two point A and B. Print that point which is closer to the point P.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the data set for this problem is an integer representing the number of collections of data that follow. Each collection contains 4 integers: the x-coordinate and then the 
y-coordinate of point A followed by the x-coordinate and then the  y-coordinate of point B.

-----Output:-----
All letters are upper case.
The output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below.

-----Assumptions:-----
The x-coordinate is in the range –20 .. 20. The y-coordinate is in the range –20 .. 20.


-----Sample Input:-----
4
3 -2 -5 -3
0 6 1 2
-7 8 4 -1
3 3 -2 2

-----Sample Output:-----
A IS CLOSER
B IS CLOSER
B IS CLOSER
B IS CLOSER
