You are given a total of S items.Only N items can be purchased only. These items will be picked randomly. You need M item including your personal item. Your shopping will complete only if there are atleast K of her item and your personal item. What is the probability that you will purchase your K item with your personal item. -----Input:----- First line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test starts with a single line having 4 space separated integers, S, N, M and K. -----Output:----- For each test case, output a line containing the required probability. The answer will be accepted if the relative error is not more than 10-6. -----Constraints:----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ S ≤ 1000 1 ≤ N ≤ S 1 ≤ M ≤ S 0 ≤ K < M -----Example:-----Input: 3 10 10 5 3 10 4 6 4 3 2 2 1 Output: 1.000000 0.000000 0.500000
