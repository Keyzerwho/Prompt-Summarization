Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val|Â and A is an ancestor of B. Example 1: Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13] Output: 7 Note: The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000. Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.
