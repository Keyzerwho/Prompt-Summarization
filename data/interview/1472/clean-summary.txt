You are given a number $N$.You have to find a $Special$ $Number$ and a $Partial$ special number.Special Number are those product of its digits is equal to number itself and there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it. Print the count of the $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given $N$ . -----Input:----- - Integers $N$ is taken as input from input stream. -----Output:----- - Print the number of $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given $N$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq N \leq 100$ numbers to be count will be less then 10^6 -----Sample Input:----- 3 -----Sample Output:----- 1 20 -----EXPLANATION:----- There are only one natural numbers, the product of the digits of which is 3 :- {3}. There are 20 natural numbers with digit 1 , whose product of the digits is 3 :-{13, 31, 113 ,131 311 ,1113 ,1131 ,1311, 3111 ,11113, 11131, 11311 ,13111, 31111, 111113, 111131, 111311,113111, 131111 ,311111}
