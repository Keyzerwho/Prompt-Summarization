You are given circular track of radius $R$.Two person A and B are standing on the same point.They have to complete $X round and speed of A and B are given. You have to find how many times they will meet after the race starts and before completing all the rounds. -----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, four integers $X, R, A, B$. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer the number of times whey will meet before any of them completes $X$ rounds. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq R \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq X \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq A \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq B \leq 10^9$ - Speed of both are different -----Sample Input:----- 2 3 10 2 5 2 20 5 10 -----Sample Output:----- 1 0
