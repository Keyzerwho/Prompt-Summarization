There are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free.

Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of voters.

The next $n$ lines contains the description of voters. $i$-th line contains two integers $m_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^9, 0 \le m_i < n$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.
