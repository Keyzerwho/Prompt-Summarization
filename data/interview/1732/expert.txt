The input given are lists of linear equations.

You need to write a method ```solve``` that accepts the input and outputs a dictionary with a value for each variable in the equations. 

If the system does not have a unique solution, return ```null```.

For example :  
  
"2x + 4y + 6z = 18"  
"3y + 3z = 6"  
"x + 2y = z - 3"
  
should result in a map :  
  
x = 2  
y = -1  
z = 3
