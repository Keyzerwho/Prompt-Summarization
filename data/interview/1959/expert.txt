You are given glasses stacked in a pyramid.
You need to output how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is when champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.

Glasses poured will be in the range of [0, 10 ^ 9].
i and j will be in the range of [0, 99].

Example 1:
Input: poured = 1, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1
Output: 0.0
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). 
There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

Example 2:
Input: poured = 2, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1
Output: 0.5
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. 
The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.
