We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  
Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.  
When the top most glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  
When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is (both i and j are 0 indexed.)

Glasses poured will be in the range of [0, 10 ^ 9].
i and j will be in the range of [0, 99].
 

Example 1:
Input: poured = 1, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1
Output: 0.0
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). 
There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

Example 2:
Input: poured = 2, query_glass = 1, query_row = 1
Output: 0.5
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. 
The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.
