A stack of circular disk should be arranged in such a way that radius of disk on the top of the stack should not exceed the radius of the largest disk in the stack by more than 1. The bottom most disk should have its radius as 1. Find out in how many ways stack can be created containing N disks. Input First line of the input contains T (T <= 1000) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000) denoting the size of the required stack. Output For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size N can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo 1000000007. Example Input 2 1 2 Output 1 2
