Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". For the equation, if there is no solution, return "No solution" or if infinite solutions, return "Infinite solutions" or if exactly one solution for the equation, ensure that the value of x is an integer. Example 1: Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2" Output: "x=2" Example 2: Input: "x=x" Output: "Infinite solutions" Example 3: Input: "2x=x" Output: "x=0" Example 4: Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2" Output: "x=-1" Example 5: Input: "x=x+2" Output: "No solution"
