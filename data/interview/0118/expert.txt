You are given an array of length $n$ and you want to split it into several non-empty sets. The value of $i$-th element is $a_i$. You want to generate the maximum number of sets from the list. There is a restriction for each set: the number of values in the team multiplied by the minimum value among all values in the team must be at least $x$.

Each value should belong to at most one set. Some value may be left without being part of any set.

-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5; 1 \le x \le 10^9$) — the number of values and the restriction of sets respectively.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots , a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the value of the $i$-th element.

The sum of $n$ over all inputs does not exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of sets that you can generate.
