You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers. For instance, if we are given an array $[10, 20, 30, 40]$, we can permute it so that it becomes $[20, 40, 10, 30]$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($20>10$, $40>20$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $2$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case. Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of integers. You can permute its integers. You want to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Find the maximal number of such integers. 

This is now a little serie :) Funny Dots You will get two Integer n (width) and m (height) and your task is to draw following pattern. Each line is seperated with '\n'. Both integers are equal or greater than 1. No need to check for invalid parameters. e.g.:                                           +---+---+---+             +---+                         | o | o | o | dot(1,1) => | o |          dot(3,2) =>    +---+---+---+                         +---+                         | o | o | o |                                           +---+---+---+  Serie: ASCII Fun ASCII Fun #1: X-Shape ASCII Fun #2: Funny Dots ASCII Fun #3: Puzzle Tiles ASCII Fun #4: Build a pyrami

You are given an unweighted, undirected graph. Write a program to check if it's a tree topology. 
tl;dr: Write a program to check for a given unweighted, undirected graph whether it's a tree topology or not. 

You are given a text consisting of n lines. Each line contains some space-separated words, consisting of lowercase English letters. We define a syllable as a string that contains exactly one vowel and any arbitrary number (possibly none) of consonants. In English alphabet following letters are considered to be vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y'. Each word of the text that contains at least one vowel can be divided into syllables. Each character should be a part of exactly one syllable. For example, the word "mamma" can be divided into syllables as "ma" and "mma", "mam" and "ma", and "mamm" and "a". Words that consist of only consonants should be ignored. The verse patterns for the given text is a sequence of n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. Text matches the given verse pattern if for each i from 1 to n one can divide words of the i-th line in syllables in such a way that the total number of syllables is equal to p_{i}. You are given the text and the verse pattern. Check, if the given text matches the given verse pattern.
