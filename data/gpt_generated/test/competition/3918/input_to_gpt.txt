Implement a function which takes a string, and returns its hash value. Algorithm steps: * `a` := sum of the ascii values of the input characters * `b` := sum of every difference between the consecutive characters of the input (second char minus first char, third minus second, ...) * `c` := (`a` OR `b`) AND ((NOT `a`) shift left by 2 bits) * `d` := `c` XOR (32 * (`total_number_of_spaces` + 1)) * return `d` **Note**: OR, AND, NOT, XOR are bitwise operations. ___ ###

-----Problem Statement----- Levy's conjecture, named after Hyman Levy, states that all odd integers greater than 5 can be represented as the sum of an odd prime number and an even semiprime. To put it algebraically, 2n + 1 = p + 2q always has a solution in primes p and q (not necessary to be distinct) for n > 2. (Source: Wikipedia) In this problem, given a positive integer N (not necessary to be odd integer greater than 5). Your task is to calculate how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 
tl;dr: You are given a positive integer N.Find how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) are there such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 

Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

You are given two arrays A and B, each of size n. The error, E, between these two arrays is defined $E = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(a_{i} - b_{i})^{2}$. You have to perform exactly k_1 operations on array A and exactly k_2 operations on array B. In one operation, you have to choose one element of the array and increase or decrease it by 1. Output the minimum possible value of error after k_1 operations on array A and k_2 operations on array B have been performed.
