 You are given a string of length N. The string contains only lowercase letters. You are also given a list of M conditions. Each condition is a triplet of integers (x_i, l_i, r_i). The triplet represents the number of lowercase letters in the string that are less than or equal to x_i, the number of lowercase letters in the string that are greater than or equal to l_i, and the number of lowercase letters in the string that are greater than or equal to r_i. Your goal is to find the number of ways to paint the string to satisfy all the conditions. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M l_1 r_1 x_1 l_2 r_2 x_2 : l_M r_M x_M -----Output----- Print the number of ways to paint the squares to satisfy all the conditions, modulo 10^9+7. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 1 3 3 -----Sample Output----- 6 The six ways are:  - RGB  - RBG  - GRB  - GBR  - BRG  - BGR where R, G and B correspond to red, green and blue squares, respectively.
