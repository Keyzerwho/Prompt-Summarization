Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is `to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others`. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in **evenness**. Help Bob   to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number. `!` Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a `real IQ test`, which means indexes of the elements start from `1 (not 0)` ##
tl;dr: Write a function that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number. 

Han Solo and Chewbacca start a space journey to planet Naboo on the Millennium Falcon. During the journey they land at a mysterious planet with high gravity where they find n diamond stones scattered all around. All the stones are of same weight. Each stone has a value according to its purity which can be detected by a special device. They choose to divide the stones fairly among themselves in two halves so that they carry almost equal weights such that the difference between the value of two halves is as small as possible. If n is even, then sizes of two halves must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd, then size of one half must be (n-1)/2 and size of the other half must be (n+1)/2. Given the value of stones, help them to divide the stones among themselves. 
tl;dr: Given a set of n numbers, divide them into subsets of sizes at most different by 1, such that difference in the sum of numbers in each subset is minimum. 

Karlsson has recently discovered a huge stock of berry jam jars in the basement of the house. More specifically, there were $2n$ jars of strawberry and blueberry jam. All the $2n$ jars are arranged in a row. The stairs to the basement are exactly in the middle of that row. So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly $n$ jars to his left and $n$ jars to his right. For example, the basement might look like this: [Image]  Being the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right. Finally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.  Jars are numbered from $1$ to $2n$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $n$ and $n+1$. What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left  Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: There were $2n$ values of A and B arranged in a list. You should start at the middle of the list. $n$ values to the left and $n$ values to the right. You can choose to make a value zero from either the first non-zero value to left or the first non-zero value to right. Finally, at the end the number of A's and B's should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.  Jars are numbered from $1$ to $2n$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $n$ and $n+1$. What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left  Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases. 

There are N squares arranged in a row. The squares are numbered 1, 2, ..., N, from left to right. Snuke is painting each square in red, green or blue. According to his aesthetic sense, the following M conditions must all be satisfied. The i-th condition is:  - There are exactly x_i different colors among squares l_i, l_i + 1, ..., r_i. In how many ways can the squares be painted to satisfy all the conditions  Find the count modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   300  - 1   M   300  - 1   l_i   r_i   N  - 1   x_i   3
