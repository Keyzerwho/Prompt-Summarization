Your are given a string $S$ containing only lowercase letter and a array of character $arr$. Find whether the given string only contains characters from the given character array.  Print $1$ if the string contains characters from the given array only else print $0$. 
tl;dr: You are given an array to check whether the characters of given string S belongs to it or not. Print 1 if it contains else print 0. 

There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

There are N squares arranged in a row. The squares are numbered 1, 2, ..., N, from left to right. Snuke is painting each square in red, green or blue. According to his aesthetic sense, the following M conditions must all be satisfied. The i-th condition is:  - There are exactly x_i different colors among squares l_i, l_i + 1, ..., r_i. In how many ways can the squares be painted to satisfy all the conditions  Find the count modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   300  - 1   M   300  - 1   l_i   r_i   N  - 1   x_i   3
