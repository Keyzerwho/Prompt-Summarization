 You are given a rooted tree with n nodes. Each internal node has at least two sons. You need to determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain n nodes. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 24). Next line contains n positive integers: the i-th number represents c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n). -----Output----- Output on the first line "YES" (without quotes) if there exist at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions, otherwise output "NO" (without quotes).  -----Examples----- Input 4 1 1 1 4 Output YES Input 5 1 1 5 2 1 Output NO
