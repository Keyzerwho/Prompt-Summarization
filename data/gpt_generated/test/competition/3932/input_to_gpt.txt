Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem. You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once  Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a b c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a bbc" and "babbc". Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring. Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

For an array $b$ of length $m$ we define the function $f$ as  $ f(b) = \begin{cases} b[1] & \quad \text{if } m = 1 \\ f(b[1] \oplus b[2],b[2] \oplus b[3],\dots,b[m-1] \oplus b[m]) & \quad \text{otherwise,} \end{cases} $  where $\oplus$ is bitwise exclusive OR. For example, $f(1,2,4,8)=f(1\oplus2,2\oplus4,4\oplus8)=f(3,6,12)=f(3\oplus6,6\oplus12)=f(5,10)=f(5\oplus10)=f(15)=15$ You are given an array $a$ and a few queries. Each query is represented as two integers $l$ and $r$. The answer is the maximum value of $f$ on all continuous subsegments of the array $a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$.

You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of $n\cdot m$ identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. $\{3$  The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece.  Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

Iahub and Iahubina went to a picnic in a forest full of trees. Less than 5 minutes passed before Iahub remembered of trees from programming. Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food.  Iahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that   each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;  node i has c_{i} nodes in its subtree   Iahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain n nodes.
