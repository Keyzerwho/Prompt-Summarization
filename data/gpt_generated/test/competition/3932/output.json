Moreover, he invented a new problem and Iahubina has to solve it, otherwise Iahub won't give her the food. Iahub asks Iahubina: can you build a rooted tree, such that   each internal node (a node with at least one son) has at least two sons;  node i has c_{i} nodes in its subtree   Iahubina has to guess the tree. Being a smart girl, she realized that it's possible no tree can follow Iahub's restrictions. In this way, Iahub will eat all the food. You need to help Iahubina: determine if there's at least one tree following Iahub's restrictions. The required tree must contain n nodes. ",
