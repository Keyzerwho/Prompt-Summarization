 Given a tree with N vertices, find a way to color the tree with black and white colors and weights so that the sum of the weights of the vertices with the same color as a given vertex is equal to a given number.
-----Inputs----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N P_2 P_3 ... P_N X_1 X_2 ... X_N -----Outputs----- If it is possible to allocate colors and weights to the vertices so that the condition is satisfied, print POSSIBLE; otherwise, print IMPOSSIBLE. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 1 4 3 2 -----Sample Output----- POSSIBLE For example, the following allocation satisfies the condition:  - Set the color of Vertex 1 to white and its weight to 2.  - Set the color of Vertex 2 to black and its weight to 3.  - Set the color of Vertex 3 to white and its weight to 2. There are also other possible allocations.
