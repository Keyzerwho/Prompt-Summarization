To each vertex in the tree, Snuke will allocate a color, either black or white, and a non-negative integer weight. Snuke has a favorite integer sequence, X_1, X_2, ..., X_N, so he wants to allocate colors and weights so that the following condition is satisfied for all v. - The total weight of the vertices with the same color as v among the vertices contained in the subtree whose root is v, is X_v. Here, the subtree whose root is v is the tree consisting of Vertex v and all of its descendants. Determine whether it is possible to allocate colors and weights in this way. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \\leq N \\leq 1 000  - 1 \\leq P_i \\leq i - 1  - 0 \\leq X_i \\leq 5 000 ",
