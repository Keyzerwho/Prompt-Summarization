Moreover, the girl wrote a positive integer to every edge of the tree (possibly, different integers on different edges). Let's define dist(v, u) as the sum of the integers written on the edges of the simple path from v to u. The vertex v controls the vertex u (v   u) if and only if u is in the subtree of v and dist(v, u)   a_{u}. Alyona wants to settle in some vertex. In order to do this, she wants to know for each vertex v what is the number of vertices u such that v controls u. ",
