A subsequence of a string S is a string that can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from S without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, arc, artistic and (an empty string) are all subsequences of artistic; abc and ci are not. You are given a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Find the shortest string among the strings consisting of lowercase English letters that are not subsequences of A. If there are more than one such string, find the lexicographically smallest one among them. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |A| \leq 2 \times 10^5  - A consists of lowercase English letters.

Given a string S. You have to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of S are grouped and groups are space-separated (see sample below)

Gildong recently learned how to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in $O(n\log{n})$ time for a sequence of length $n$. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn't find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he's going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, to test his code with your output. The quiz is as follows. Gildong provides a string of length $n-1$, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element. He wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible.

Fox Ciel studies number theory. She thinks a non-empty set S contains non-negative integers is perfect if and only if for any $a, b \in S$ (a can be equal to b), $(a \text{xor} b) \in S$. Where operation xor means exclusive or operation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or). Please calculate the number of perfect sets consisting of integers not greater than k. The answer can be very large, so print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
