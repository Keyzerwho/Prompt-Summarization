There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

Given a string S. You have to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of S are grouped and groups are space-separated (see sample below)

Fox Ciel studies number theory. She thinks a non-empty set S contains non-negative integers is perfect if and only if for any $a, b \in S$ (a can be equal to b), $(a \text{xor} b) \in S$. Where operation xor means exclusive or operation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or). Please calculate the number of perfect sets consisting of integers not greater than k. The answer can be very large, so print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
