 Calculate the number of perfect sets consisting of integers not greater than k. The answer can be very large, so print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of required sets modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 2 Input 2 Output 3 Input 3 Output 5 Input 4 Output 6 -----Note----- In example 1, there are 2 such sets: {0} and {0, 1}. Note that {1} is not a perfect set since 1 xor 1 = 0 and {1} doesn't contain zero. In example 4, there are 6 such sets: {0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}, {0, 4} and {0, 1, 2, 3}.
