Let's say we have a number, `num`. Find the number of values of `n` such that: there exists `n` consecutive **positive** values that sum up to `num`. A positive number is `> 0`. `n` can also be 1. ```python #
tl;dr: Given `num`. Find the total count of existing consecutive **positive** values that sum up to `num`. A positive number is `> 0`. `n` can also be 1. ```python #
