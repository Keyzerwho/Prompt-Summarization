There is an integer sequence of length 2^N: A_0, A_1, ..., A_{2^N-1}. (Note that the sequence is 0-indexed.) For every integer K satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 2^N-1, solve the following problem:  - Let i and j be integers. Find the maximum value of A_i + A_j where 0 \leq i < j \leq 2^N-1 and (i or j) \leq K. Here, or denotes the bitwise OR. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 18  - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9  - All values in input are integers.

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.   Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   
tl;dr: You have to apply + and - symbol between the given list non-negative integers to achieve the target S. In how many ways are there to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   

Molly Hooper has n different kinds of chemicals arranged in a line. Each of the chemicals has an affection value, The i-th of them has affection value a_{i}. Molly wants Sherlock to fall in love with her. She intends to do this by mixing a contiguous segment of chemicals together to make a love potion with total affection value as a non-negative integer power of k. Total affection value of a continuous segment of chemicals is the sum of affection values of each chemical in that segment. Help her to do so in finding the total number of such segments.
