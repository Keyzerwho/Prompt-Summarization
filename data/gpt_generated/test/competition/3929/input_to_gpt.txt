You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. Find the maximum possible value of $a_{i} \operatorname{mod} a_{j}$ (integer remainder of a_{i} divided by a_{j}), where 1   i, j   n and a_{i}   a_{j}.

In Finite Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (FEIS), all integer sequences of lengths between 1 and N (inclusive) consisting of integers between 1 and K (inclusive) are listed. Let the total number of sequences listed in FEIS be X. Among those sequences, find the (X/2)-th (rounded up to the nearest integer) lexicographically smallest one. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N,K \leq 3   10^5  - N and K are integers.

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers. You want to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of $len$ to it, where $len$ is the length of this segment (added integers can be different).  It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero.

Snuke has decided to play with N cards and a deque (that is, a double-ended queue). Each card shows an integer from 1 through N, and the deque is initially empty. Snuke will insert the cards at the beginning or the end of the deque one at a time, in order from 1 to N. Then, he will perform the following action N times: take out the card from the beginning or the end of the deque and eat it. Afterwards, we will construct an integer sequence by arranging the integers written on the eaten cards, in the order they are eaten. Among the sequences that can be obtained in this way, find the number of the sequences such that the K-th element is 1. Print the answer modulo 10^{9} + 7. -----Constraints-----  - 1   K   N   2{,}000
