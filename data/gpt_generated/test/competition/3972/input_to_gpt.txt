You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number. Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.  Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order. 
tl;dr: You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number in a pair. A chain if formed when a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Find the length of longest chain which can be formed.  

Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

Let $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ be an array of $n$ positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index $i$ such that $a_i = i$, and remove $a_i$ from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated). The weight of $a$ is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove. You must answer $q$ independent queries $(x, y)$: after replacing the $x$ first elements of $a$ and the $y$ last elements of $a$ by $n+1$ (making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of $a$

How many infinite sequences a_1, a_2, ... consisting of {{1, ... ,n}} satisfy the following conditions   - The n-th and subsequent elements are all equal. That is, if n \leq i,j, a_i = a_j.  - For every integer i, the a_i elements immediately following the i-th element are all equal. That is, if i < j < k\leq i+a_i, a_j = a_k. Find the count modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq n \leq 10^6
