You've got array A, consisting of n integers and a positive integer k. Array A is indexed by integers from 1 to n. You need to permute the array elements so that value $\sum_{i = 1}^{n - k}|A [ i ] - A [ i + k ]|$ became minimal possible. In particular, it is allowed not to change order of elements at all.

There are $n$ lamps on a line, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each one has an initial state off ($0$) or on ($1$). You're given $k$ subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, such that the intersection of any three subsets is empty. In other words, for all $1 \le i_1 < i_2 < i_3 \le k$, $A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap A_{i_3} = \varnothing$. In one operation, you can choose one of these $k$ subsets and switch the state of all lamps in it. It is guaranteed that, with the given subsets, it's possible to make all lamps be simultaneously on using this type of operation. Let $m_i$ be the minimum number of operations you have to do in order to make the $i$ first lamps be simultaneously on. Note that there is no condition upon the state of other lamps (between $i+1$ and $n$), they can be either off or on. You have to compute $m_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$.

Bike is interested in permutations. A permutation of length n is an integer sequence such that each integer from 0 to (n - 1) appears exactly once in it. For example, [0, 2, 1] is a permutation of length 3 while both [0, 2, 2] and [1, 2, 3] is not. A permutation triple of permutations of length n (a, b, c) is called a Lucky Permutation Triple if and only if $\forall i(1 \leq i \leq n), a_{i} + b_{i} \equiv c_{i} \operatorname{mod} n$. The sign a_{i} denotes the i-th element of permutation a. The modular equality described above denotes that the remainders after dividing a_{i} + b_{i} by n and dividing c_{i} by n are equal. Now, he has an integer n and wants to find a Lucky Permutation Triple. Could you please help him
