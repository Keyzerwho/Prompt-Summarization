=====Problem Statement===== ABCXYZ company has up to 100 employees. The company decides to create a unique identification number (UID) for each of its employees. The company has assigned you the task of validating all the randomly generated UIDs. A valid UID must follow the rules below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits (0-9). It should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z & 0-9). No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid UID.

Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

In this kata, you have to define a function named **func** that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - **[output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation]**, but **you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.**

A few years ago Sajjad left his school and register to another one due to security reasons. Now he wishes to find Amir, one of his schoolmates and good friends. There are n schools numerated from 1 to n. One can travel between each pair of them, to do so, he needs to buy a ticket. The ticker between schools i and j costs $(i + j) \operatorname{mod}(n + 1)$ and can be used multiple times. Help Sajjad to find the minimum cost he needs to pay for tickets to visit all schools. He can start and finish in any school.
