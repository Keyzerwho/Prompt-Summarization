We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.   Each glass holds one cup (250ml) of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.   When the top most glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.   When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has it's excess champagne fall on the floor.) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.   After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.   After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.   After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below. Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is (both i and j are 0 indexed.)   
tl;dr: You are given glasses stacked in a pyramid. You need to output how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is when champagne is poured in the first glass at the top. Glasses poured will be in the range of [0, 10 ^ 9]. i and j will be in the range of [0, 99]. 

Chef is very organised in whatever he does and likes to maintain statistics of his work. Chef has expertise in web development and hence is a regular contributor on a forum. Chef sometimes makes multiple contributions in a single day.. Each day chef makes at least 1 contribution he is assigned a shade of green. The greater the number of contribution in a single day the darker shade of green he gets assigned and vice versa. Your job is to find out the number of days chef is assigned a same shade of green and print the number of times chef is assigned a unique shade of green. -----INPUT----- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of days chef has contributed towards the forum. The next line contains N spaced integers the number of contributions chef has made if he has made any. -----OUTPUT----- The output will contain numbers on separate lines that show the number of individual green shades chef has earned in ascending order of intensity of the shades of green. -----CONSTRAINTS----- 1 <= T <= 25 5 <= N <= 50 1 <= Ai <= 50 -----EXAMPLE

Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees. 
tl;dr: You are given three angles of a triangle.Check whether these angles form a valid triangle or not.  

In one of the games Arkady is fond of the game process happens on a rectangular field. In the game process Arkady can buy extensions for his field, each extension enlarges one of the field sizes in a particular number of times. Formally, there are n extensions, the i-th of them multiplies the width or the length (by Arkady's choice) by a_{i}. Each extension can't be used more than once, the extensions can be used in any order. Now Arkady's field has size h   w. He wants to enlarge it so that it is possible to place a rectangle of size a   b on it (along the width or along the length, with sides parallel to the field sides). Find the minimum number of extensions needed to reach Arkady's goal.
