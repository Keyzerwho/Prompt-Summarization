Allen is hosting a formal dinner party. $2n$ people come to the event in $n$ pairs (couples). After a night of fun, Allen wants to line everyone up for a final picture. The $2n$ people line up, but Allen doesn't like the ordering. Allen prefers if each pair occupies adjacent positions in the line, as this makes the picture more aesthetic. Help Allen find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions he must perform to make it so that each couple occupies adjacent positions in the line. 
tl;dr: You have to line up $2n$ number of different items which are in $n$ pairs. Find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions which must be performed to make it so that each item pair occupies adjacent positions in the line. 

----- ARRAY AND DISTINCT ELEMENTS ----- Chef is multitalented but he mistakenly took part in 2 contest which will take place at the same time. So while chef is busy at one cooking contest, he wants you to take part in coding contest. Chef wants u to solve this program for him. 	 You have been given an array of size n. You have to calculate a subarray of size k with maximum sum having distinct elements same as original array.

You are playing some computer game. One of its levels puts you in a maze consisting of n lines, each of which contains m cells. Each cell either is free or is occupied by an obstacle. The starting cell is in the row r and column c. In one step you can move one square up, left, down or right, if the target cell is not occupied by an obstacle. You can't move beyond the boundaries of the labyrinth. Unfortunately, your keyboard is about to break, so you can move left no more than x times and move right no more than y times. There are no restrictions on the number of moves up and down since the keys used to move up and down are in perfect condition. Now you would like to determine for each cell whether there exists a sequence of moves that will put you from the starting cell to this particular one. How many cells of the board have this property
