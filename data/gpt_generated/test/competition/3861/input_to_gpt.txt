Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between). For example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     3    / \   9  20     /  \    15   7 return its zigzag level order traversal as: [   [3],   [20,9],   [15,7]

The chef was searching for his pen in the garage but he found his old machine with a display and some numbers on it. If some numbers entered then some different output occurs on the display. Chef wants to crack the algorithm that the machine is following. 
tl;dr: Write a code to print the average of the multiplication of a given number N with N-1 integer.                                    1 

Given an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of n integers, find the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square. A number x is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer y such that x = y^2.
