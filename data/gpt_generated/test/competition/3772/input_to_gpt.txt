A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are there  Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there  
tl;dr: You are at top-left corner of an m X n grid. Considering only down or right actions, how many unique paths are present to reach bottom-right corner. 

Snuke is playing a puzzle game. In this game, you are given a rectangular board of dimensions R   C, filled with numbers. Each integer i from 1 through N is written twice, at the coordinates (x_{i,1},y_{i,1}) and (x_{i,2},y_{i,2}). The objective is to draw a curve connecting the pair of points where the same integer is written, for every integer from 1 through N. Here, the curves may not go outside the board or cross each other. Determine whether this is possible. -----Constraints-----  - 1   R,C   10^8  - 1   N   10^5  - 0   x_{i,1},x_{i,2}   R(1   i   N)  - 0   y_{i,1},y_{i,2}   C(1   i   N)  - All given points are distinct.  - All input values are integers.

Mad scientist Mike is building a time machine in his spare time. To finish the work, he needs a resistor with a certain resistance value. However, all Mike has is lots of identical resistors with unit resistance R_0 = 1. Elements with other resistance can be constructed from these resistors. In this problem, we will consider the following as elements:   one resistor;  an element and one resistor plugged in sequence;  an element and one resistor plugged in parallel.  [Image]  With the consecutive connection the resistance of the new element equals R = R_{e} + R_0. With the parallel connection the resistance of the new element equals $R = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{e}} + \frac{1}{R_{0}}}$. In this case R_{e} equals the resistance of the element being connected. Mike needs to assemble an element with a resistance equal to the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$. Determine the smallest possible number of resistors he needs to make such an element.
