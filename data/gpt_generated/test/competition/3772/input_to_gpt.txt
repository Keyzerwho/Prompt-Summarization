At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

Task: Make a function that converts a word to pig latin. The rules of pig latin are: ``` If the word has more than 3 letters:   1. Take the first letter of a word and move it to the end   2. Add -ay to the word Otherwise leave the word alone. ```

Mr. E Ven only likes even length words. Please create a translator so that he doesn't have to hear those pesky odd length words. For some reason he also hates punctuation, he likes his sentences to flow. Your translator should take in a string and output it with all odd length words having an extra letter (the last letter in the word). It should also remove all punctuation (., !) as well as any underscores (_). "How did we end up here  We go " translated becomes->  "Howw didd we endd up here We go

Mad scientist Mike is building a time machine in his spare time. To finish the work, he needs a resistor with a certain resistance value. However, all Mike has is lots of identical resistors with unit resistance R_0 = 1. Elements with other resistance can be constructed from these resistors. In this problem, we will consider the following as elements:   one resistor;  an element and one resistor plugged in sequence;  an element and one resistor plugged in parallel.  [Image]  With the consecutive connection the resistance of the new element equals R = R_{e} + R_0. With the parallel connection the resistance of the new element equals $R = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{e}} + \frac{1}{R_{0}}}$. In this case R_{e} equals the resistance of the element being connected. Mike needs to assemble an element with a resistance equal to the fraction $\frac{a}{b}$. Determine the smallest possible number of resistors he needs to make such an element.
