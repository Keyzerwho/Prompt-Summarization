#Permutation  position In this kata you will have to permutate through a string of lowercase letters, each permutation will start at ```a``` and you must calculate how many iterations it takes to reach the current permutation. ##examples ``` input: 'a' result: 1 input: 'c' result: 3 input: 'z' result: 26 input: 'foo' result: 3759 input: 'aba' result: 27 input: 'abb' result: 28 ``
tl;dr: You will have to permutate through a string of lowercase letters, each permutation will start at a and you must calculate how many iterations it takes to reach the current permutation. 

You are given a sequence of $n$ digits $d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}$. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:  each digit is painted either in the color $1$ or in the color $2$;  if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $1$, and then after them all the digits painted in the color $2$, then the resulting sequence of $n$ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).  For example, for the sequence $d=914$ the only valid coloring is $211$ (paint in the color $1$ two last digits, paint in the color $2$ the first digit). But $122$ is not a valid coloring ($9$ concatenated with $14$ is not a non-decreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Nauuo is a girl who loves random picture websites. One day she made a random picture website by herself which includes $n$ pictures. When Nauuo visits the website, she sees exactly one picture. The website does not display each picture with equal probability. The $i$-th picture has a non-negative weight $w_i$, and the probability of the $i$-th picture being displayed is $\frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^nw_j}$. That is to say, the probability of a picture to be displayed is proportional to its weight. However, Nauuo discovered that some pictures she does not like were displayed too often.  To solve this problem, she came up with a great idea: when she saw a picture she likes, she would add $1$ to its weight; otherwise, she would subtract $1$ from its weight. Nauuo will visit the website $m$ times. She wants to know the expected weight of each picture after all the $m$ visits modulo $998244353$. Can you help her  The expected weight of the $i$-th picture can be denoted by $\frac {q_i} {p_i}$ where $\gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, you need to print an integer $r_i$ satisfying $0\le r_i<998244353$ and $r_i\cdot p_i\equiv q_i\pmod{998244353}$. It can be proved that such $r_i$ exists and is unique.
