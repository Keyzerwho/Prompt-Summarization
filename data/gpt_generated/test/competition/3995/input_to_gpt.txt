An array of integers $p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n}$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$. There is a hidden permutation of length $n$. For each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element. Your task is to restore the permutation.

Genos recently installed the game Zuma on his phone. In Zuma there exists a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal of the game is to destroy all the gemstones in the line as quickly as possible. In one second, Genos is able to choose exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  Let us remind, that the string (or substring) is called palindrome, if it reads same backwards or forward. In our case this means the color of the first gemstone is equal to the color of the last one, the color of the second gemstone is equal to the color of the next to last and so on.

Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 5. If any of the permutations is divisible by 5 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: If any of the permutations of a given number  N is divisible by 5, then print 1 else print 0. 

Let $s$ be some string consisting of symbols "0" or "1". Let's call a string $t$ a substring of string $s$, if there exists such number $1 \leq l \leq |s| - |t| + 1$ that $t = s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_{l + |t| - 1}$. Let's call a substring $t$ of string $s$ unique, if there exist only one such $l$.  For example, let $s = $"1010111". A string $t = $"010" is an unique substring of $s$, because $l = 2$ is the only one suitable number. But, for example $t = $"10" isn't a unique substring of $s$, because $l = 1$ and $l = 3$ are suitable. And for example $t =$"00" at all isn't a substring of $s$, because there is no suitable $l$. Today Vasya solved the following problem at the informatics lesson: given a string consisting of symbols "0" and "1", the task is to find the length of its minimal unique substring. He has written a solution to this problem and wants to test it. He is asking you to help him. You are given $2$ positive integers $n$ and $k$, such that $(n \bmod 2) = (k \bmod 2)$, where $(x \bmod 2)$ is operation of taking remainder of $x$ by dividing on $2$. Find any string $s$ consisting of $n$ symbols "0" or "1", such that the length of its minimal unique substring is equal to $k$.
