You are given a string S consisting of a,b and c. Find the number of strings that can be possibly obtained by repeatedly performing the following operation zero or more times, modulo 998244353:  - Choose an integer i such that 1\leq i\leq |S|-1 and the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in S are different. Replace each of the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in S with the character that differs from both of them (among a, b and c). -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq |S| \leq 2   10^5  - S consists of a, b and c.

A simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1 
tl;dr: You have find out the frequency of letters in a given string and print it as the new string which comprises of the letter followed by its frequency.For example string is- abcdabf. Then the new string is- a2b2c1d1f1 

Let $s$ be some string consisting of symbols "0" or "1". Let's call a string $t$ a substring of string $s$, if there exists such number $1 \leq l \leq |s| - |t| + 1$ that $t = s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_{l + |t| - 1}$. Let's call a substring $t$ of string $s$ unique, if there exist only one such $l$.  For example, let $s = $"1010111". A string $t = $"010" is an unique substring of $s$, because $l = 2$ is the only one suitable number. But, for example $t = $"10" isn't a unique substring of $s$, because $l = 1$ and $l = 3$ are suitable. And for example $t =$"00" at all isn't a substring of $s$, because there is no suitable $l$. Today Vasya solved the following problem at the informatics lesson: given a string consisting of symbols "0" and "1", the task is to find the length of its minimal unique substring. He has written a solution to this problem and wants to test it. He is asking you to help him. You are given $2$ positive integers $n$ and $k$, such that $(n \bmod 2) = (k \bmod 2)$, where $(x \bmod 2)$ is operation of taking remainder of $x$ by dividing on $2$. Find any string $s$ consisting of $n$ symbols "0" or "1", such that the length of its minimal unique substring is equal to $k$.
