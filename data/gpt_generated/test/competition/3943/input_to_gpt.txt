You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. Find the maximum possible value of $a_{i} \operatorname{mod} a_{j}$ (integer remainder of a_{i} divided by a_{j}), where 1   i, j   n and a_{i}   a_{j}.

We have a sequence A of N non-negative integers. Compute the sum of \prod _{i = 1} ^N \dbinom{B_i}{A_i} over all sequences B of N non-negative integers whose sum is at most M, and print it modulo (10^9 + 7). Here, \dbinom{B_i}{A_i}, the binomial coefficient, denotes the number of ways to choose A_i objects from B_i objects, and is 0 when B_i < A_i. -----Constraints-----  - All values in input are integers.  - 1 \leq N \leq 2000  - 1 \leq M \leq 10^9  - 0 \leq A_i \leq 2000

A rectangle with sides $A$ and $B$ is cut into rectangles with cuts parallel to its sides. For example, if $p$ horizontal and $q$ vertical cuts were made, $(p + 1) \cdot (q + 1)$ rectangles were left after the cutting. After the cutting, rectangles were of $n$ different types. Two rectangles are different if at least one side of one rectangle isn't equal to the corresponding side of the other. Note that the rectangle can't be rotated, this means that rectangles $a \times b$ and $b \times a$ are considered different if $a \neq b$. For each type of rectangles, lengths of the sides of rectangles are given along with the amount of the rectangles of this type that were left after cutting the initial rectangle. Calculate the amount of pairs $(A; B)$ such as the given rectangles could be created by cutting the rectangle with sides of lengths $A$ and $B$. Note that pairs $(A; B)$ and $(B; A)$ are considered different when $A \neq B$.

User ainta loves to play with cards. He has a cards containing letter "o" and b cards containing letter "x". He arranges the cards in a row, and calculates the score of the deck by the formula below.  At first, the score is 0.  For each block of contiguous "o"s with length x the score increases by x^2.  For each block of contiguous "x"s with length y the score decreases by y^2.    For example, if a = 6, b = 3 and ainta have arranged the cards in the order, that is described by string "ooxoooxxo", the score of the deck equals 2^2 - 1^2 + 3^2 - 2^2 + 1^2 = 9. That is because the deck has 5 blocks in total: "oo", "x", "ooo", "xx", "o". User ainta likes big numbers, so he wants to maximize the score with the given cards. Help ainta make the score as big as possible. Note, that he has to arrange all his cards.
