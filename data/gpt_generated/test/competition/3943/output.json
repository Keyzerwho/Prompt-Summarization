He arranges the cards in a row, and calculates the score of the deck by the formula below. At first, the score is 0. For each block of contiguous \"o\"s with length x the score increases by x^2. For each block of contiguous \"x\"s with length y the score decreases by y^2. For example, if a = 6, b = 3 and ainta have arranged the cards in the order, that is described by string \"ooxoooxxo\", the score of the deck equals 2^2 - 1^2 + 3^2 - 2^2 + 1^2 = 9. That is because the deck has 5 blocks in total: \"oo\", \"x\", \"ooo\", \"xx\", \"o\". User ainta likes big numbers, so he wants to maximize the score with the given cards. Help ainta make the score as big as possible. Note, that he has to arrange all his cards.",
