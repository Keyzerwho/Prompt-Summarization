 You are given a device with two wires. The wires are plugged into the wall and the device in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view): [Image] You are also given the sequence in which the wires run above each other. You are not allowed to unplug the wires or move the device. Determine if it is possible to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. 
-----Input----- The single line of the input contains a sequence of characters "+" and "-" of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). The i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) position of the sequence contains the character "+", if on the i-th step from the wall the "plus" wire runs above the "minus" wire, and the character "-" otherwise. -----Output----- Print either "Yes" (without the quotes) if the wires can be untangled or "No" (without the quotes) if the wires cannot be untangled. -----Examples----- Input -++- Output Yes Input +- Output No Input ++ Output Yes Input - Output No -----Note----- The first testcase corresponds to the picture in the statement. To untangle the wires, one can first move the "plus" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then draw it under the "minus" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses. In the second testcase the "plus" wire makes one full revolution around the "minus" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled:  [Image]  In the third testcase the "plus" wire simply runs above the "minus" wire twice in sequence. The wires can be untangled by lifting "plus" and moving it higher:  [Image]  In the fourth testcase the "minus" wire runs above the "plus" wire once. The wires cannot be untangled without moving the device itself:  [Image]
