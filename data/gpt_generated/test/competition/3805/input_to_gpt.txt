Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom  note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.  Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note. 
tl;dr: Given two strings a and b return true if a can be constructed from string charecters in b else false Each letter in the b string can only be used once in your a string. 

Given an integer, take the (mean) average of each pair of consecutive digits. Repeat this process until you have a single integer, then return that integer. e.g. 
tl;dr: You are given an integer, take the average of each pair of consecutive digits. Repeat this process until you have a single integer, then return that integer. If the average of two digits is not an integer, round the result up. 

Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for extraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the first time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper glance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that the wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again. The device is powered by two wires "plus" and "minus". The wires run along the floor from the wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the device have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are plugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or more places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture below has four such places (top view): [Image]  Mike knows the sequence in which the wires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the "plus" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture). He would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving the device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved and stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut. To understand the problem better please read the notes to the test samples.
