# Task Elections are in progress! Given an array of numbers representing votes given to each of the candidates, and an integer which is equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election. The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all. **Note**: big arrays will be tested. #

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1. As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero. For example: ```python monkeyCount(10) # --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] monkeyCount(1) # --> [1] ``
tl;dr: Given the number n, populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero. 

Leha decided to move to a quiet town Vi kopolis, because he was tired by living in Bankopolis. Upon arrival he immediately began to expand his network of hacked computers. During the week Leha managed to get access to n computers throughout the town. Incidentally all the computers, which were hacked by Leha, lie on the same straight line, due to the reason that there is the only one straight street in Vi kopolis. Let's denote the coordinate system on this street. Besides let's number all the hacked computers with integers from 1 to n. So the i-th hacked computer is located at the point x_{i}. Moreover the coordinates of all computers are distinct.  Leha is determined to have a little rest after a hard week. Therefore he is going to invite his friend Noora to a restaurant. However the girl agrees to go on a date with the only one condition: Leha have to solve a simple task. Leha should calculate a sum of F(a) for all a, where a is a non-empty subset of the set, that consists of all hacked computers. Formally, let's denote A the set of all integers from 1 to n. Noora asks the hacker to find value of the expression $\sum_{a \subseteq A, a \neq \varnothing} F(a)$. Here F(a) is calculated as the maximum among the distances between all pairs of computers from the set a. Formally, $F(a) = \operatorname{max}_{i, j \in a}|x_{i} - x_{j}|$. Since the required sum can be quite large Noora asks to find it modulo 10^9 + 7. Though, Leha is too tired. Consequently he is not able to solve this task. Help the hacker to attend a date.
