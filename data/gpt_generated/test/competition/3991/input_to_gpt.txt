You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000.

You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.  Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1. Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.

Leha decided to move to a quiet town Vi kopolis, because he was tired by living in Bankopolis. Upon arrival he immediately began to expand his network of hacked computers. During the week Leha managed to get access to n computers throughout the town. Incidentally all the computers, which were hacked by Leha, lie on the same straight line, due to the reason that there is the only one straight street in Vi kopolis. Let's denote the coordinate system on this street. Besides let's number all the hacked computers with integers from 1 to n. So the i-th hacked computer is located at the point x_{i}. Moreover the coordinates of all computers are distinct.  Leha is determined to have a little rest after a hard week. Therefore he is going to invite his friend Noora to a restaurant. However the girl agrees to go on a date with the only one condition: Leha have to solve a simple task. Leha should calculate a sum of F(a) for all a, where a is a non-empty subset of the set, that consists of all hacked computers. Formally, let's denote A the set of all integers from 1 to n. Noora asks the hacker to find value of the expression $\sum_{a \subseteq A, a \neq \varnothing} F(a)$. Here F(a) is calculated as the maximum among the distances between all pairs of computers from the set a. Formally, $F(a) = \operatorname{max}_{i, j \in a}|x_{i} - x_{j}|$. Since the required sum can be quite large Noora asks to find it modulo 10^9 + 7. Though, Leha is too tired. Consequently he is not able to solve this task. Help the hacker to attend a date.
