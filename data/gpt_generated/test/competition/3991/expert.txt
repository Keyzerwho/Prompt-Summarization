 Given a set of points, find the sum of the maximum distance between any two points. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) denoting the number of hacked computers. The second line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the coordinates of hacked computers. It is guaranteed that all x_{i} are distinct. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the required sum modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 2 4 7 Output 3 Input 3 4 3 1 Output 9 -----Note----- There are three non-empty subsets in the first sample test:$\{4 \}$, $\{7 \}$ and $\{4,7 \}$. The first and the second subset increase the sum by 0 and the third subset increases the sum by 7 - 4 = 3. In total the answer is 0 + 0 + 3 = 3. There are seven non-empty subsets in the second sample test. Among them only the following subsets increase the answer: $\{4,3 \}$, $\{4,1 \}$, $\{3,1 \}$, $\{4,3,1 \}$. In total the sum is (4 - 3) + (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (4 - 1) = 9.
