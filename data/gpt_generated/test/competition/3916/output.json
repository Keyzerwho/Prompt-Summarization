            "text": " The system inside A.R.C.'s Library core can be considered as an undirected graph with infinite number of processing nodes, numbered with all positive integers ($1, 2, 3, \\ldots$). The node with a number $x$ ($x > 1$), is directly connected with a node with number $\\frac{x}{f(x)}$, with $f(x)$ being the lowest prime divisor of $x$. Vanessa's mind is divided into $n$ fragments. Due to more than 500 years of coma, the fragments have been scattered: the $i$-th fragment is now located at the node with a number $k_i!$ (a factorial of $k_i$). To maximize the chance of successful awakening, Ivy decides to place the samples in a node $P$, so that the total length of paths from each fragment to $P$ is smallest possible. If there are multiple fragments located at the same node, the path from that node to $P$ needs to be counted multiple times. In the world of zeros and ones, such a requirement is very simple for Ivy. Not longer than a second later, she has already figured out such a node. But for a mere human like you, is this still possible  For simplicity, please answer the minimal sum of paths' lengths from every fragment to the emotion samples' assembly node $P$. ",
