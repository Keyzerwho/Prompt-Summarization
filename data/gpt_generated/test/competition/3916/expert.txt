 Given a number $n$, find the minimal sum of paths' lengths from every fragment to the emotion samples' assembly node $P$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$) — number of fragments of Vanessa's mind. The second line contains $n$ integers: $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n$ ($0 \le k_i \le 5000$), denoting the nodes where fragments of Vanessa's mind are located: the $i$-th fragment is at the node with a number $k_i!$. -----Output----- Print a single integer, denoting the minimal sum of path from every fragment to the node with the emotion samples (a.k.a. node $P$). As a reminder, if there are multiple fragments at the same node, the distance from that node to $P$ needs to be counted multiple times as well. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 4 Output 5 Input 4 3 1 4 4 Output 6 Input 4 3 1 4 1 Output 6 Input 5 3 1 4 1 5 Output 11 -----Note----- Considering the first $24$ nodes of the system, the node network will look as follows (the nodes $1!$, $2!$, $3!$, $4!$ are drawn bold): [Image] For the first example, Ivy will place the emotion samples at the node $1$. From here:   The distance from Vanessa's first fragment to the node $1$ is $1$.  The distance from Vanessa's second fragment to the node $1$ is $0$.  The distance from Vanessa's third fragment to the node $1$ is $4$.  The total length is $5$. For the second example, the assembly node will be $6$. From here:   The distance from Vanessa's first fragment to the node $6$ is $0$.  The distance from Vanessa's second fragment to the node $6$ is $2$.  The distance from Vanessa's third fragment to the node $6$ is $2$.  The distance from Vanessa's fourth fragment to the node $6$ is again $2$.  The total path length is $6$.
