Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.  Program is very simple, Given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers. 
tl;dr: Write a program to add given two integers A and B. 

Given two strings representing two complex numbers. You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition. 
tl;dr: Write program to return a string representing the multiplication of given two  strings of complex numbers. 

 sir - CHAOS  sir - V. "Everything has been planned out. No more hidden concerns. The condition of Cytus is also perfect. The time right now...... 00:01:12...... It's time." The emotion samples are now sufficient. After almost 3 years, it's time for Ivy to awake her bonded sister, Vanessa. The system inside A.R.C.'s Library core can be considered as an undirected graph with infinite number of processing nodes, numbered with all positive integers ($1, 2, 3, \ldots$). The node with a number $x$ ($x > 1$), is directly connected with a node with number $\frac{x}{f(x)}$, with $f(x)$ being the lowest prime divisor of $x$. Vanessa's mind is divided into $n$ fragments. Due to more than 500 years of coma, the fragments have been scattered: the $i$-th fragment is now located at the node with a number $k_i!$ (a factorial of $k_i$). To maximize the chance of successful awakening, Ivy decides to place the samples in a node $P$, so that the total length of paths from each fragment to $P$ is smallest possible. If there are multiple fragments located at the same node, the path from that node to $P$ needs to be counted multiple times. In the world of zeros and ones, such a requirement is very simple for Ivy. Not longer than a second later, she has already figured out such a node. But for a mere human like you, is this still possible  For simplicity, please answer the minimal sum of paths' lengths from every fragment to the emotion samples' assembly node $P$.
