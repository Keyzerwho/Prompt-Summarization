Snuke is playing a puzzle game. In this game, you are given a rectangular board of dimensions R   C, filled with numbers. Each integer i from 1 through N is written twice, at the coordinates (x_{i,1},y_{i,1}) and (x_{i,2},y_{i,2}). The objective is to draw a curve connecting the pair of points where the same integer is written, for every integer from 1 through N. Here, the curves may not go outside the board or cross each other. Determine whether this is possible. -----Constraints-----  - 1   R,C   10^8  - 1   N   10^5  - 0   x_{i,1},x_{i,2}   R(1   i   N)  - 0   y_{i,1},y_{i,2}   C(1   i   N)  - All given points are distinct.  - All input values are integers.

You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.

Some time ago Mister B detected a strange signal from the space, which he started to study. After some transformation the signal turned out to be a permutation p of length n or its cyclic shift. For the further investigation Mister B need some basis, that's why he decided to choose cyclic shift of this permutation which has the minimum possible deviation. Let's define the deviation of a permutation p as $\sum_{i = 1}^{i = n}|p [ i ] - i|$. Find a cyclic shift of permutation p with minimum possible deviation. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Let's denote id k (0   k < n) of a cyclic shift of permutation p as the number of right shifts needed to reach this shift, for example:   k = 0: shift p_1, p_2, ... p_{n},  k = 1: shift p_{n}, p_1, ... p_{n} - 1,  ...,  k = n - 1: shift p_2, p_3, ... p_{n}, p_1.
