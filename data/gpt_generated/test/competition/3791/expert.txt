 Find a cyclic shift of permutation p with minimum possible deviation. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. 
-----Input----- First line contains single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) — the length of the permutation. The second line contains n space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the elements of the permutation. It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct. -----Output----- Print two integers: the minimum deviation of cyclic shifts of permutation p and the id of such shift. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 2 3 Output 0 0 Input 3 2 3 1 Output 0 1 Input 3 3 2 1 Output 2 1 -----Note----- In the first sample test the given permutation p is the identity permutation, that's why its deviation equals to 0, the shift id equals to 0 as well. In the second sample test the deviation of p equals to 4, the deviation of the 1-st cyclic shift (1, 2, 3) equals to 0, the deviation of the 2-nd cyclic shift (3, 1, 2) equals to 4, the optimal is the 1-st cyclic shift. In the third sample test the deviation of p equals to 4, the deviation of the 1-st cyclic shift (1, 3, 2) equals to 2, the deviation of the 2-nd cyclic shift (2, 1, 3) also equals to 2, so the optimal are both 1-st and 2-nd cyclic shifts.
