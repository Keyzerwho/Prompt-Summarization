After some transformation the signal turned out to be a permutation p of length n or its cyclic shift. For the further investigation Mister B need some basis, that's why he decided to choose cyclic shift of this permutation which has the minimum possible deviation. Let's define the deviation of a permutation p as $\\sum_{i = 1}^{i = n}|p [ i ] - i|$. Find a cyclic shift of permutation p with minimum possible deviation. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Let's denote id k (0   k < n) of a cyclic shift of permutation p as the number of right shifts needed to reach this shift, for example:   k = 0: shift p_1, p_2, ... p_{n},  k = 1: shift p_{n}, p_1, ... p_{n} - 1,  ...,  k = n - 1: shift p_2, p_3, ... p_{n}, p_1.",
