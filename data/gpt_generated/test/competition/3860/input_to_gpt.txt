You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of $n\cdot m$ identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. $\{3$  The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece.  Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

This is a follow up from my kata The old switcheroo Write ```python def encode(str) ``` that takes in a string ```str``` and replaces all the letters with their respective positions in the English alphabet. ```python encode('abc') == '123'   # a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd encode('codewars') == '315452311819' encode('abc-#@5') == '123-#@5' ``` String are case sensitive
tl;dr: Write a function encode that takes in a string str and replaces all the letters with their respective positions in the English alphabet. String are case sensitive. 

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd (not divisible by $2$) then assign (set) $a[\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ (where $i$ is the number of the current action), otherwise (if $r-l+1$ is even) assign (set) $a[\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$.  Consider the array $a$ of length $5$ (initially $a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$). Then it changes as follows:  Firstly, we choose the segment $[1; 5]$ and assign $a[3] := 1$, so $a$ becomes $[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[1; 2]$ and assign $a[1] := 2$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[4; 5]$ and assign $a[4] := 3$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 3, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[2; 2]$ and assign $a[2] := 4$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]$;  and at last we choose the segment $[5; 5]$ and assign $a[5] := 5$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]$.  Your task is to find the array $a$ of length $n$ after performing all $n$ actions. Note that the answer exists and unique. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

There are $b$ boys and $g$ girls participating in Olympiad of Metropolises. There will be a board games tournament in the evening and $n$ participants have accepted the invitation. The organizers do not know how many boys and girls are among them. Organizers are preparing red badges for girls and blue ones for boys. Vasya prepared $n+1$ decks of badges. The $i$-th (where $i$ is from $0$ to $n$, inclusive) deck contains $i$ blue badges and $n-i$ red ones. The total number of badges in any deck is exactly $n$. Determine the minimum number of decks among these $n+1$ that Vasya should take, so that there will be a suitable deck no matter how many girls and boys there will be among the participants of the tournament.
