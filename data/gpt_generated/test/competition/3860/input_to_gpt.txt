In this kata, you have to define a function named **func** that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - **[output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation]**, but **you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.**

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between). For example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     3    / \   9  20     /  \    15   7 return its zigzag level order traversal as: [   [3],   [20,9],   [15,7]

There are $b$ boys and $g$ girls participating in Olympiad of Metropolises. There will be a board games tournament in the evening and $n$ participants have accepted the invitation. The organizers do not know how many boys and girls are among them. Organizers are preparing red badges for girls and blue ones for boys. Vasya prepared $n+1$ decks of badges. The $i$-th (where $i$ is from $0$ to $n$, inclusive) deck contains $i$ blue badges and $n-i$ red ones. The total number of badges in any deck is exactly $n$. Determine the minimum number of decks among these $n+1$ that Vasya should take, so that there will be a suitable deck no matter how many girls and boys there will be among the participants of the tournament.
