Alice's school is planning to take some students from her class on a field trip. Alice is really excited about it. There are a total of S students in her class. But due to budget constraints, the school is planning to take only N students for the trip. These students will be picked randomly. And each student has equal chance of being picked. Alice's friend circle has M students including her. Though she is excited about the field trip, she will enjoy it only if there are atleast K of her friends with her on the trip. She is wondering what are the chances of that happening. She needs your help. Tell her the probability that she will enjoy given that she goes on the trip. 
tl;dr: Only N items can be chosen randomly from a total of S items. You need M item including your one personal item. If there are atleast K item which are required and one your own item. What is the probability that you will purchase your K item with your one personal item. 

There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

=====Problem Statement===== A newly opened multinational brand has decided to base their company logo on the three most common characters in the company name. They are now trying out various combinations of company names and logos based on this condition. Given a string s, which is the company name in lowercase letters, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string. Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count. Sort in descending order of occurrence count. If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in alphabetical order. For example, according to the conditions described above, GOOGLE would have it's logo with the letters G, O, E.  
tl;dr: =====Problem Statement===== Given a string s in lowercase, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string and their occurance count. Sort in descending order of occurrence count, and then by alphabetical order to break ties. For example, GOOGLE would output G 2 O 2 E 1 

Let's introduce a number system which is based on a roman digits. There are digits I, V, X, L which correspond to the numbers $1$, $5$, $10$ and $50$ respectively. The use of other roman digits is not allowed. Numbers in this system are written as a sequence of one or more digits. We define the value of the sequence simply as the sum of digits in it. For example, the number XXXV evaluates to $35$ and the number IXI   to $12$. Pay attention to the difference to the traditional roman system   in our system any sequence of digits is valid, moreover the order of digits doesn't matter, for example IX means $11$, not $9$. One can notice that this system is ambiguous, and some numbers can be written in many different ways. Your goal is to determine how many distinct integers can be represented by exactly $n$ roman digits I, V, X, L.
