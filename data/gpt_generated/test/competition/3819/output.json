There are $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$, and they were mixed with another $n$ empty cards. She piled up the $2n$ cards and drew $n$ of them. The $n$ cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining $n$ cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom. In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it   put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile. Nauuo wants to make the $n$ numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the $i$-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card $i$) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations ",
