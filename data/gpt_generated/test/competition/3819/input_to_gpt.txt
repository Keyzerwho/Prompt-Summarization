# Definition **_Strong number_** is the number that *the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself*. ## **_For example_**:  **_145_**, since  ``` 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 ``` So, **_145_** is a **_Strong number_**.  ____ # Task **_Given_** a number, **_Find if it is Strong or not_**. ____ # Warm-up (Highly recommended) # [Playing With Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers) ___ 
tl;dr: You are given a positive number, find if it is strong or not. 

You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string. Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve. 
tl;dr: You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters.You have to replace a one character by other character present in the string so that the string becomes lexicographically smallest.Find that lexicographically smallest  string. 

Given two strings, the first being a random string and the second being the same as the first, but with three added characters somewhere in the string (three same characters), Write a function that returns the added character ### E.g ``` string1 = "hello" string2 = "aaahello" // => 'a' ``` The above is just an example; the characters could be anywhere in the string and string2 is actually **shuffled**. ### Another example ``` string1 = "abcde" string2 = "2db2a2ec" // => '2' ``` Note that the added character could also exist in the original string ``` string1 = "aabbcc" string2 = "aacccbbcc" // => 'c' ``` You can assume that string2 will aways be larger than string1, and there will always be three added characters in string2. ```if:c Write the function `added_char()` that takes two strings and return the added character as described above. ``` ```if:javascript Write the function `addedChar()` that takes two strings and return the added character as described above. ``

Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards. One day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones. There are $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$, and they were mixed with another $n$ empty cards. She piled up the $2n$ cards and drew $n$ of them. The $n$ cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining $n$ cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom. In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it   put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile. Nauuo wants to make the $n$ numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the $i$-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card $i$) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations
