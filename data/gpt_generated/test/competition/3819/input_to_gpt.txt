The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other. Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both  Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others        Explanation Self-Explanator
tl;dr: You are given a string, if it contains the word berhampore , print GCETTB or if it contains serampore print GCETTS. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both, otherwise print others.Ignore the case.   Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others      

You are given a string s of length n. Does a tree with n vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., n.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., n-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - If the i-th character in s is 1, we can have a connected component of size i by removing one edge from the tree.  - If the i-th character in s is 0, we cannot have a connected component of size i by removing any one edge from the tree. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq n \leq 10^5  - s is a string of length n consisting of 0 and 1.

Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards. One day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones. There are $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$, and they were mixed with another $n$ empty cards. She piled up the $2n$ cards and drew $n$ of them. The $n$ cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining $n$ cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom. In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it   put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile. Nauuo wants to make the $n$ numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the $i$-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card $i$) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations
