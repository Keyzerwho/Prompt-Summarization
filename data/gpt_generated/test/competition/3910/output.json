He saw n pairs of friends sitting around a table. i-th pair consisted of a boy, sitting on the a_{i}-th chair, and his girlfriend, sitting on the b_{i}-th chair. The chairs were numbered 1 through 2n in clockwise direction. There was exactly one person sitting on each chair. \u00a0[Image] \u00a0There were two types of food: Kooft and Zahre-mar. Now Mehrdad wonders, was there any way to serve food for the guests such that: \u00a0 \u00a0Each person had exactly one type of food, \u00a0No boy had the same type of food as his girlfriend, \u00a0Among any three guests sitting on consecutive chairs, there was two of them who had different type of food. Note that chairs 2n and 1 are considered consecutive. \u00a0Find the answer for the Mehrdad question. If it was possible, find some arrangement of food types that satisfies the conditions. \u00a0",
