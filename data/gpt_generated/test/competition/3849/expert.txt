 Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values. The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 10^5$). The second line contains a single string of length $n$ that only consists of $0$ and $1$, representing the situation of these $n$ cards, where the color side of the $i$-th card faces up if the $i$-th character is $1$, or otherwise, it faces down and the $i$-th character is $0$. -----Output----- Print "once again" (without quotes) if the total number of their moves can exceed $10^9$, which is considered a draw. In other cases, print "tokitsukaze" (without quotes) if Tokitsukaze will win, or "quailty" (without quotes) if Quailty will win. Note that the output characters are case-sensitive, and any wrong spelling would be rejected. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 0101 Output quailty Input 6 1 010101 Output once again Input 6 5 010101 Output tokitsukaze Input 4 1 0011 Output once again -----Note----- In the first example, no matter how Tokitsukaze moves, there would be three cards with color sides facing the same direction after her move, and Quailty can flip the last card to this direction and win. In the second example, no matter how Tokitsukaze moves, Quailty can choose the same card and flip back to the initial situation, which can allow the game to end in a draw. In the third example, Tokitsukaze can win by flipping the leftmost five cards up or flipping the rightmost five cards down. The fourth example can be explained in the same way as the second example does.
