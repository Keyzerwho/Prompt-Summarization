Codefortia is a small island country located somewhere in the West Pacific. It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads. Codefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:   it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible.  The king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned  
tl;dr: You are given a connected graph of $n$ nodes and $m$ bidirectional edges. For each node $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, you need to find a minimum spanning tree. Then output the minimum cost required to travel between node $1$ and node $p$.

You are given an array $a_1, a_2 \dots a_n$. Calculate the number of tuples $(i, j, k, l)$ such that:   $1 \le i < j < k < l \le n$;  $a_i = a_k$ and $a_j = a_l$;

"Duel!" Betting on the lovely princess Claris, the duel between Tokitsukaze and Quailty has started. There are $n$ cards in a row. Each card has two sides, one of which has color. At first, some of these cards are with color sides facing up and others are with color sides facing down. Then they take turns flipping cards, in which Tokitsukaze moves first. In each move, one should choose exactly $k$ consecutive cards and flip them to the same side, which means to make their color sides all face up or all face down. If all the color sides of these $n$ cards face the same direction after one's move, the one who takes this move will win. Princess Claris wants to know who will win the game if Tokitsukaze and Quailty are so clever that they won't make mistakes.
