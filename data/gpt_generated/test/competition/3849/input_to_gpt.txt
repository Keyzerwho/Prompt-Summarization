Given a credit card number we can determine who the issuer/vendor is with a few basic knowns. ```if:python Complete the function `get_issuer()` that will use the values shown below to determine the card issuer for a given card number. If the number cannot be matched then the function should return the string `Unknown`. ``` ```if-not:python Complete the function `getIssuer()` that will use the values shown below to determine the card issuer for a given card number. If the number cannot be matched then the function should return the string `Unknown`. ``` ```if:typescript Where `Issuer` is defined with the following enum type. ~~~typescript enum Issuer {   VISA = 'VISA',   AMEX = 'AMEX',   Mastercard = 'Mastercard',   Discover = 'Discover',   Unknown = 'Unknown', } ~~~ ``` ```markdown | Card Type  | Begins With          | Number Length | |------------|----------------------|---------------| | AMEX       | 34 or 37             | 15            | | Discover   | 6011                 | 16            | | Mastercard | 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55 | 16            | | VISA       | 4                    | 13 or 16      | ``` ```if:c,cpp **C/C++ note:** The return value in C is not freed. ``` ##

Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values.  For example: `[23, 3, 19, 21, 16]` should return `20` (i.e., `23 - 3`). `[1, 434, 555, 34, 112]` should return `554` (i.e., `555 - 1`). The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow

"Duel!" Betting on the lovely princess Claris, the duel between Tokitsukaze and Quailty has started. There are $n$ cards in a row. Each card has two sides, one of which has color. At first, some of these cards are with color sides facing up and others are with color sides facing down. Then they take turns flipping cards, in which Tokitsukaze moves first. In each move, one should choose exactly $k$ consecutive cards and flip them to the same side, which means to make their color sides all face up or all face down. If all the color sides of these $n$ cards face the same direction after one's move, the one who takes this move will win. Princess Claris wants to know who will win the game if Tokitsukaze and Quailty are so clever that they won't make mistakes.
