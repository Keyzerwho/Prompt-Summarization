The factorial of a number, `n!`, is defined for whole numbers as the product of all integers from `1` to `n`.  For example, `5!` is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120` Most factorial implementations use a recursive function to determine the value of `factorial(n)`. However, this blows up the stack for large values of `n` - most systems cannot handle stack depths much greater than 2000 levels. Write an implementation to calculate the factorial of arbitrarily large numbers, *without recursion.* # Rules * `n < 0` should return `nil`/  `None` * `n = 0` should return `1` * `n > 0` should return `n!` # Note Codewars limits the amount of data it will send back and forth, which may introduce a false ceiling for how high of a value of `n` it will accept. All tests use values less than this limit

You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

A bracketed sequence is called correct (regular) if by inserting "+" and "1" you can get a well-formed mathematical expression from it. For example, sequences "(())()", "()" and "(()(()))" are correct, while ")(", "(()" and "(()))(" are not. The teacher gave Dmitry's class a very strange task   she asked every student to come up with a sequence of arbitrary length, consisting only of opening and closing brackets. After that all the students took turns naming the sequences they had invented. When Dima's turn came, he suddenly realized that all his classmates got the correct bracketed sequence, and whether he got the correct bracketed sequence, he did not know. Dima suspects now that he simply missed the word "correct" in the task statement, so now he wants to save the situation by modifying his sequence slightly. More precisely, he can the arbitrary number of times (possibly zero) perform the reorder operation. The reorder operation consists of choosing an arbitrary consecutive subsegment (substring) of the sequence and then reordering all the characters in it in an arbitrary way. Such operation takes $l$ nanoseconds, where $l$ is the length of the subsegment being reordered. It's easy to see that reorder operation doesn't change the number of opening and closing brackets. For example for "))((" he can choose the substring ")(" and do reorder ")()(" (this operation will take $2$ nanoseconds). Since Dima will soon have to answer, he wants to make his sequence correct as fast as possible. Help him to do this, or determine that it's impossible.
