# Scenario  *You're saying good-bye your best friend* , **_See you next happy year_** .  **_Happy Year_** *is the year with only distinct digits* , (e.g) **_2018_** ___ # Task **_Given_** a year, **_Find_** **_The next happy year_** or **_The closest year You'll see your best friend_**      ![!alt](https://i.imgur.com/mdX8dJP.png) ![!alt](https://i.imgur.com/mdX8dJP.png) ___ 
tl;dr: Given a year, find the next happy year or the closest year you'll see your best friend. Input Year with in range 1000     y     9000. 

We have a set of consecutive numbers from ```1``` to ```n```. We want to count all the subsets that do not contain consecutive numbers. E.g. If our set ```S1``` is equal to ```[1,2,3,4,5]``` The subsets that fulfill these property are: ``` [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,4],[2,5],[3,5],[1,3,5] ``` A total of      ```12   ``` subsets. From the set ```S2``` equals to```[1,2,3]```, it is obvious that we have only ```4``` subsets and are: ``` [1],[2],[3],[1,3] ``` Make a code that may give the amount of all these subsets for any integer       ```n >= 2       ```. Features of the random tests: ``` number of tests = 100  10 <= n <= 120 ``

Seyyed and MoJaK are friends of Sajjad. Sajjad likes a permutation. Seyyed wants to change the permutation in a way that Sajjad won't like it. Seyyed thinks more swaps yield more probability to do that, so he makes MoJaK to perform a swap between every pair of positions (i, j), where i < j, exactly once. MoJaK doesn't like to upset Sajjad. Given the permutation, determine whether it is possible to swap all pairs of positions so that the permutation stays the same. If it is possible find how to do that.
