Seyyed thinks more swaps yield more probability to do that, so he makes MoJaK to perform a swap between every pair of positions (i, j), where i < j, exactly once. MoJaK doesn't like to upset Sajjad. Given the permutation, determine whether it is possible to swap all pairs of positions so that the permutation stays the same. If it is possible find how to do that.",
