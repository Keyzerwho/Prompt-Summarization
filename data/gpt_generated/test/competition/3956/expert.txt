 You are given N dice with K sides each. You are also given K. Find the number of combinations of N sides shown by the dice such that the sum of no two different sides is i. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: K N -----Output----- Print 2K-1 integers. The t-th of them (1\leq t\leq 2K-1) should be the answer for i=t+1. -----Sample Input----- 3 3 -----Sample Output----- 7 7 4 7 7  - For i=2, the combinations (1,2,2),(1,2,3),(1,3,3),(2,2,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,3),(3,3,3) satisfy the condition, so the answer is 7.  - For i=3, the combinations (1,1,1),(1,1,3),(1,3,3),(2,2,2),(2,2,3),(2,3,3),(3,3,3) satisfy the condition, so the answer is 7.  - For i=4, the combinations (1,1,1),(1,1,2),(2,3,3),(3,3,3) satisfy the condition, so the answer is 4.
