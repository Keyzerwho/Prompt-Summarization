Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him  Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.  
tl;dr: Given a two dimensional metrix of Latin letters, determine if the word "spoon" (case insensitive) appears in the matrix. 

Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

Consider an N \times N matrix. Let us denote by a_{i, j} the entry in the i-th row and j-th column. For a_{i, j} where i=1 or j=1 holds, its value is one of 0, 1 and 2 and given in the input. The remaining entries are defined as follows:  - a_{i,j} = \mathrm{mex}(a_{i-1,j}, a_{i,j-1}) (2 \leq i, j \leq N) where \mathrm{mex}(x, y) is defined by the following table:\mathrm{mex}(x, y)y=0y=1y=2x=0121x=1200x=2100 How many entries of the matrix are 0, 1, and 2, respectively  -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 500{,}000  - a_{i,j}'s given in input are one of 0, 1 and 2.
