# Task  "AL-AHLY" and "Zamalek" are the best teams in Egypt, but "AL-AHLY" always wins the matches between them. "Zamalek" managers want to know what is the best match they've played so far.    The best match is the match they lost with the minimum goal difference. If there is more than one match with the same difference, choose the one "Zamalek" scored more goals in.    Given the information about all matches they played, return the `index` of the best match (`0-based`). If more than one valid result, return the smallest index. #

You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of $n\cdot m$ identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. $\{3$  The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece.  Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks. 

Consider an N \times N matrix. Let us denote by a_{i, j} the entry in the i-th row and j-th column. For a_{i, j} where i=1 or j=1 holds, its value is one of 0, 1 and 2 and given in the input. The remaining entries are defined as follows:  - a_{i,j} = \mathrm{mex}(a_{i-1,j}, a_{i,j-1}) (2 \leq i, j \leq N) where \mathrm{mex}(x, y) is defined by the following table:\mathrm{mex}(x, y)y=0y=1y=2x=0121x=1200x=2100 How many entries of the matrix are 0, 1, and 2, respectively  -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 500{,}000  - a_{i,j}'s given in input are one of 0, 1 and 2.
