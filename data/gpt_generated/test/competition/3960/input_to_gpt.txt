This challenge is based on [the kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/n-smallest-elements-in-original-order) by GiacomoSorbi. Before doing this one it is advisable to complete the non-performance version first. ___ # Task You will be given an array of random integers and a number `n`. You have to extract `n` smallest integers out of it **preserving the original order**. # 
tl;dr: # Task You will be given an array of random integers and a number n. You have to extract n smallest integers out of it. The original order need to be preserved. # 

# Task  CodeBots decided to make a gift for CodeMaster's birthday. They got a pack of candies of various sizes from the store, but instead of giving the whole pack they are trying to make the biggest possible candy from them. On each turn it is possible:    ```  to pick any two candies of the same size and merge  them into a candy which will be two times bigger;  to pick a single candy of an even size and split it   into two equal candies half of this size each.``` What is the size of the biggest candy they can make as a gift  #

At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

Something happened in Uzhlyandia again... There are riots on the streets... Famous Uzhlyandian superheroes Shean the Sheep and Stas the Giraffe were called in order to save the situation. Upon the arriving, they found that citizens are worried about maximum values of the Main Uzhlyandian Function f, which is defined as follows:$f(l, r) = \sum_{i = l}^{r - 1}|a [ i ] - a [ i + 1 ]|\cdot(- 1)^{i - l}$ In the above formula, 1   l < r   n must hold, where n is the size of the Main Uzhlyandian Array a, and |x| means absolute value of x. But the heroes skipped their math lessons in school, so they asked you for help. Help them calculate the maximum value of f among all possible values of l and r for the given array a.
