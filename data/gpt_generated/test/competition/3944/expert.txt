 Given a string, find the longest palindrome substring.

-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M K -----Output----- Print the answer modulo 1\,000\,000\,007 (=10^9+7). -----Sample Input----- 1 1 1 -----Sample Output----- 17  - If Alice's card is a, then Alice will win regardless of Bob's and Charlie's card. There are 3Ã—3=9 such patterns.  - If Alice's card is b, Alice will only win when Bob's card is a, or when Bob's card is c and Charlie's card is a. There are 3+1=4 such patterns.  - If Alice's card is c, Alice will only win when Charlie's card is a, or when Charlie's card is b and Bob's card is a. There are 3+1=4 such patterns. Thus, there are total of 9+4+4=17 patterns that will lead to Alice's victory.
