You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.  Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a_1 - x, a_2 - x, ..., a_{n} - x is as small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

Simple transposition is a basic and simple cryptography technique. We make 2 rows and put first a letter in the Row 1, the second in the Row 2, third in Row 1 and so on until the end. Then we put the text from Row 2 next to the Row 1 text and thats it. Complete the function that receives a string and encrypt it with this simple transposition. ##

Master Shifu is training Po to become The Dragon Warrior and as a final assignment he must obtain maximum deliciousness from dumplings. There are  $N$ plates of dumplings in front of him with deliciousness $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$, Po can choose any number of continuous plates of  dumplings. The total deliciousness is the sum of deliciousness of all the  chosen dumplings. What is the minimum number of plates he must choose so that total deliciousness is maximum possible  
tl;dr: You are given N values with weight attached to each value. You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight is maximum possible. 

Alice, Bob and Charlie are playing Card Game for Three, as below:  - At first, each of the three players has a deck consisting of some number of cards. Alice's deck has N cards, Bob's deck has M cards, and Charlie's deck has K cards. Each card has a letter a, b or c written on it. The orders of the cards in the decks cannot be rearranged.  - The players take turns. Alice goes first.  - If the current player's deck contains at least one card, discard the top card in the deck. Then, the player whose name begins with the letter on the discarded card, takes the next turn. (For example, if the card says a, Alice takes the next turn.)  - If the current player's deck is empty, the game ends and the current player wins the game. There are 3^{N+M+K} possible patters of the three player's initial decks. Among these patterns, how many will lead to Alice's victory  Since the answer can be large, print the count modulo 1\,000\,000\,007 (=10^9+7). -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 3 10^5  - 1 \leq M \leq 3 10^5  - 1 \leq K \leq 3 10^5 -----Partial Scores-----  - 500 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying the following: 1 \leq N \leq 1000, 1 \leq M \leq 1000, 1 \leq K \leq 1000.
