Given an array containing only zeros and ones, find the index of the zero that, if converted to one, will make the longest sequence of ones. For instance, given the array: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ``` replacing the zero at index 10 (counting from 0) forms a sequence of 9 ones: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]                   '------------^------------' ``` Your task is to complete the function that determines where to replace a zero with a one to make the maximum length subsequence. **

Heidi is a statistician to the core, and she likes to study the evolution of marmot populations in each of V (1   V   100) villages! So it comes that every spring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her barn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome her friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures. Arriving in a village, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of inhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April Fools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of inhabitants P (10   P   1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-negative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:   Poisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{p^{k} e^{-P}}{k !}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,  Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{1}{2 P + 1}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P.  Heidi collects exactly 250 answers per village. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution. Heidi cannot tell marmots apart, so she may query some marmots several times, and each time the marmot will answer with a new number drawn from the village's distribution. Can you help Heidi to find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
tl;dr: The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  

Alice, Bob and Charlie are playing Card Game for Three, as below:  - At first, each of the three players has a deck consisting of some number of cards. Alice's deck has N cards, Bob's deck has M cards, and Charlie's deck has K cards. Each card has a letter a, b or c written on it. The orders of the cards in the decks cannot be rearranged.  - The players take turns. Alice goes first.  - If the current player's deck contains at least one card, discard the top card in the deck. Then, the player whose name begins with the letter on the discarded card, takes the next turn. (For example, if the card says a, Alice takes the next turn.)  - If the current player's deck is empty, the game ends and the current player wins the game. There are 3^{N+M+K} possible patters of the three player's initial decks. Among these patterns, how many will lead to Alice's victory  Since the answer can be large, print the count modulo 1\,000\,000\,007 (=10^9+7). -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 3 10^5  - 1 \leq M \leq 3 10^5  - 1 \leq K \leq 3 10^5 -----Partial Scores-----  - 500 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying the following: 1 \leq N \leq 1000, 1 \leq M \leq 1000, 1 \leq K \leq 1000.
