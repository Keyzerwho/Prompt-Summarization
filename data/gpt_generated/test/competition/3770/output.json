On Vertex i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) two integers A_i and B_i are written. Edge i (1 \\leq i \\leq M) connects Vertices U_i and V_i. Snuke picks zero or more vertices and delete them. Deleting Vertex i costs A_i. When a vertex is deleted, edges that are incident to the vertex are also deleted. The score after deleting vertices is calculated as follows: - The score is the sum of the scores of all connected components. - The score of a connected component is the absolute value of the sum of B_i of the vertices in the connected component. Snuke's profit is (score) - (the sum of costs). Find the maximum possible profit Snuke can gain. \n",
