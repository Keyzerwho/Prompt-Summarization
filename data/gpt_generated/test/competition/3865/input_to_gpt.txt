Genos recently installed the game Zuma on his phone. In Zuma there exists a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal of the game is to destroy all the gemstones in the line as quickly as possible. In one second, Genos is able to choose exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  Let us remind, that the string (or substring) is called palindrome, if it reads same backwards or forward. In our case this means the color of the first gemstone is equal to the color of the last one, the color of the second gemstone is equal to the color of the next to last and so on. 
tl;dr: You are given a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal is to destroy all the gemstones in the line. In one second, exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones is chosen that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again.  What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the $k$ TV shows. You know the schedule for the next $n$ days: a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le k$), where $a_i$ is the show, the episode of which will be shown in $i$-th day. The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately. How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows $d$ ($1 \le d \le n$) days in a row  In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of $d$ consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

A positive integer $a$ is given. Baron Munchausen claims that he knows such a positive integer $n$ that if one multiplies $n$ by $a$, the sum of its digits decreases $a$ times. In other words, $S(an) = S(n)/a$, where $S(x)$ denotes the sum of digits of the number $x$.  Find out if what Baron told can be true.
