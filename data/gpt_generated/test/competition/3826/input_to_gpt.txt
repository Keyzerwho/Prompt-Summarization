You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.

At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

You are given an array $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$. You can remove at most one subsegment from it. The remaining elements should be pairwise distinct. In other words, at most one time you can choose two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$) and delete integers $a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$ from the array. Remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.  Find the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all remaining elements distinct.
