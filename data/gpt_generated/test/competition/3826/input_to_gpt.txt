Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values.  For example: `[23, 3, 19, 21, 16]` should return `20` (i.e., `23 - 3`). `[1, 434, 555, 34, 112]` should return `554` (i.e., `555 - 1`). The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow
tl;dr: Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values. The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow. 

Given an array of positive integers arr, calculate the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array. Return the sum of all odd-length subarrays of arr.   
tl;dr: You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. 

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the $k$ TV shows. You know the schedule for the next $n$ days: a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le k$), where $a_i$ is the show, the episode of which will be shown in $i$-th day. The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately. How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows $d$ ($1 \le d \le n$) days in a row  In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of $d$ consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

You are given an array $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$. You can remove at most one subsegment from it. The remaining elements should be pairwise distinct. In other words, at most one time you can choose two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$) and delete integers $a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$ from the array. Remaining elements should be pairwise distinct.  Find the minimum size of the subsegment you need to remove to make all remaining elements distinct.
