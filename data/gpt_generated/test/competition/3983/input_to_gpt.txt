You are given an array a with n distinct integers. Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}} (1   x_{i}   n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} a_{x_{i}} \neq \sum_{i = 1}^{k} b_{x_{i}}$

You are given a non-empty string s consisting of lowercase English letters. You have to pick exactly one non-empty substring of s and shift all its letters 'z' $\rightarrow$ 'y' $\rightarrow$ 'x' $\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow$ 'b' $\rightarrow$ 'a' $\rightarrow$ 'z'. In other words, each character is replaced with the previous character of English alphabet and 'a' is replaced with 'z'. What is the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by performing this shift exactly once

Given is an undirected graph G consisting of N vertices numbered 1 through N and M edges numbered 1 through M. Edge i connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i bidirectionally. G is said to be a good graph when both of the conditions below are satisfied. It is guaranteed that G is initially a good graph.  - Vertex 1 and Vertex N are not connected.  - There are no self-loops and no multi-edges. Taro the first and Jiro the second will play a game against each other. They will alternately take turns, with Taro the first going first. In each player's turn, the player can do the following operation:  - Operation: Choose vertices u and v, then add to G an edge connecting u and v bidirectionally. The player whose addition of an edge results in G being no longer a good graph loses. Determine the winner of the game when the two players play optimally. You are given T test cases. Solve each of them. -----Constraints-----  - All values in input are integers.  - 1 \leq T \leq 10^5  - 2 \leq N \leq 10^{5}  - 0 \leq M \leq \min(N(N-1)/2,10^{5})  - 1 \leq a_i,b_i \leq N  - The given graph is a good graph.  - In one input file, the sum of N and that of M do not exceed 2 \times 10^5.
