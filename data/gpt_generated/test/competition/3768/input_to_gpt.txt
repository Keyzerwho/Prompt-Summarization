Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion  Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. 
tl;dr: You have to shuffle digits of the given proportion(x : y :: z : w) in order to check that is it possible to make new proportion or not. 

Dima is a beginner programmer. During his working process, he regularly has to repeat the following operation again and again: to remove every second element from the array. One day he has been bored with easy solutions of this problem, and he has come up with the following extravagant algorithm. Let's consider that initially array contains n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty. Each step Dima selects a non-empty array cell with the maximum index and moves the number written in it to the nearest empty cell to the left of the selected one. The process continues until all n numbers will appear in the first n cells of the array. For example if n = 4, the array is changing as follows: [Image]  You have to write a program that allows you to determine what number will be in the cell with index x (1   x   n) after Dima's algorithm finishes.

Is every value in the array an array  This should only test the second array dimension of the array. The values of the nested arrays don't have to be arrays.

Alice and Bob decided to eat some fruit. In the kitchen they found a large bag of oranges and apples. Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took an apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the friends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they wrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the cards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the letter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out of the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the number of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had written letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the fruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last card way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over. You know how many oranges and apples was in the bag at first. Your task is to find any sequence of cards that Alice and Bob could have played with.
