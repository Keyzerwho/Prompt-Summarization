One day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:  The string consists of n lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals n), exactly k of these letters are distinct.  No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, then the following inequality holds, s_{i}   s_{i} + 1(1   i < n).  Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest.  Help him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist. ",
