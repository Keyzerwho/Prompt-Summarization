 Given a string s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, find the lexicographically smallest string that meets the following conditions: 
-----Input----- A single line contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) — the string's length and the number of distinct letters. -----Output----- In a single line print the required string. If there isn't such string, print "-1" (without the quotes). -----Examples----- Input 7 4 Output ababacd Input 4 7 Output -1
