This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls $x = 0$). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices $0 \leq i < m$, such that $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \right\rfloor$ is odd. Tell her the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$. 
tl;dr: You have $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ where $a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given. You want to pick some dolls, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks. The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$.  Find the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$. 

You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $A$, $B$ and $C$.  Find the number of different groups of three integers ($a$, $b$, $c$) such that $1\leq a\leq b\leq c$ and parallelepiped $A\times B\times C$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $a\times b\times c$. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction. For example, parallelepiped $1\times 5\times 6$ can be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 3\times 5$, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 2\times 3$.

Little penguin Polo adores strings. But most of all he adores strings of length n. One day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:  The string consists of n lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals n), exactly k of these letters are distinct.  No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, then the following inequality holds, s_{i}   s_{i} + 1(1   i < n).  Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest.  Help him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist. String x = x_1x_2... x_{p} is lexicographically less than string y = y_1y_2... y_{q}, if either p < q and x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ... , x_{p} = y_{p}, or there is such number r (r < p, r < q), that x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ... , x_{r} = y_{r} and x_{r} + 1 < y_{r} + 1. The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.
