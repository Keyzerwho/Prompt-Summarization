Toad Rash has a binary string $s$. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones. Let $n$ be the length of $s$. Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $l$, $r$ that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ and there is at least one pair of integers $x$, $k$ such that $1 \leq x, k \leq n$, $l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$, and $s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$. Find this number of pairs for Rash.

You have $n$ gifts and you want to give all of them to children. Of course, you don't want to offend anyone, so all gifts should be equal between each other. The $i$-th gift consists of $a_i$ candies and $b_i$ oranges. During one move, you can choose some gift $1 \le i \le n$ and do one of the following operations:   eat exactly one candy from this gift (decrease $a_i$ by one);  eat exactly one orange from this gift (decrease $b_i$ by one);  eat exactly one candy and exactly one orange from this gift (decrease both $a_i$ and $b_i$ by one).  Of course, you can not eat a candy or orange if it's not present in the gift (so neither $a_i$ nor $b_i$ can become less than zero). As said above, all gifts should be equal. This means that after some sequence of moves the following two conditions should be satisfied: $a_1 = a_2 = \dots = a_n$ and $b_1 = b_2 = \dots = b_n$ (and $a_i$ equals $b_i$ is not necessary). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to equalize all the given gifts. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or at both $x_i$ and $y_i$ The value of an element can not go below 0. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

Little penguin Polo adores strings. But most of all he adores strings of length n. One day he wanted to find a string that meets the following conditions:  The string consists of n lowercase English letters (that is, the string's length equals n), exactly k of these letters are distinct.  No two neighbouring letters of a string coincide; that is, if we represent a string as s = s_1s_2... s_{n}, then the following inequality holds, s_{i}   s_{i} + 1(1   i < n).  Among all strings that meet points 1 and 2, the required string is lexicographically smallest.  Help him find such string or state that such string doesn't exist. String x = x_1x_2... x_{p} is lexicographically less than string y = y_1y_2... y_{q}, if either p < q and x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ... , x_{p} = y_{p}, or there is such number r (r < p, r < q), that x_1 = y_1, x_2 = y_2, ... , x_{r} = y_{r} and x_{r} + 1 < y_{r} + 1. The characters of the strings are compared by their ASCII codes.
