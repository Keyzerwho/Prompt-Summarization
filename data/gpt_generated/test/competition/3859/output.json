The integers from 1 through N are written on the white balls, one on each ball, and they are also written on the black balls, one on each ball. The integer written on the i-th ball from the left (1   i   2N) is a_i, and the color of this ball is represented by a letter c_i. c_i = W represents the ball is white; c_i = B represents the ball is black. Takahashi the human wants to achieve the following objective:  - For every pair of integers (i,j) such that 1   i < j   N, the white ball with i written on it is to the left of the white ball with j written on it.  - For every pair of integers (i,j) such that 1   i < j   N, the black ball with i written on it is to the left of the black ball with j written on it. In order to achieve this, he can perform the following operation:  - Swap two adjacent balls. Find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the objective. ",
