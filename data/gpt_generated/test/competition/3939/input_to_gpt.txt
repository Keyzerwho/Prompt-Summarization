Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable x and its coefficient. If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution". If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions". If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of x is an integer. 
tl;dr: Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". For the equation, if there is no solution, return "No solution" or if infinite solutions, return "Infinite solutions" or if exactly one solution for the equation, ensure that the value of x is an integer. 

Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

Toad Rash has a binary string $s$. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones. Let $n$ be the length of $s$. Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $l$, $r$ that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ and there is at least one pair of integers $x$, $k$ such that $1 \leq x, k \leq n$, $l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$, and $s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$. Find this number of pairs for Rash.

Slime has a sequence of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment $[l \ldots r]$ of this sequence and replace all values $a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r$ to the value of median of $\{a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r\}$. In this problem, for the integer multiset $s$, the median of $s$ is equal to the $\lfloor \frac{|s|+1}{2}\rfloor$-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of $\{1,4,4,6,5\}$ is $4$, and the median of $\{1,7,5,8\}$ is $5$. Slime wants Orac to make $a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_n = k$ using these operations. Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.
