Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.  The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

And each move is represent by a character. The valid entity moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the entity makes a circle. 

Slime has a sequence of positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. In one operation Orac can choose an arbitrary subsegment $[l \ldots r]$ of this sequence and replace all values $a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r$ to the value of median of $\{a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r\}$. In this problem, for the integer multiset $s$, the median of $s$ is equal to the $\lfloor \frac{|s|+1}{2}\rfloor$-th smallest number in it. For example, the median of $\{1,4,4,6,5\}$ is $4$, and the median of $\{1,7,5,8\}$ is $5$. Slime wants Orac to make $a_1 = a_2 = \ldots = a_n = k$ using these operations. Orac thinks that it is impossible, and he does not want to waste his time, so he decided to ask you if it is possible to satisfy the Slime's requirement, he may ask you these questions several times.
