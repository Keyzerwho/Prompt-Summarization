 Given an array of strings, find the k-th character of each string.
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10) — the number of Nephren's questions. Each of the next q lines describes Nephren's question and contains two integers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18). -----Output----- One line containing q characters. The i-th character in it should be the answer for the i-th query. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 1 2 1 111111111111 Output Wh.
