Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him  Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.  
tl;dr: Given a two dimensional metrix of Latin letters, determine if the word "spoon" (case insensitive) appears in the matrix. 

# How many urinals are free  In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and the next person peeing.  For example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with  5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4). ![Imgur Urinals](https://i.imgur.com/imZE6xm.png) ## Your task: You need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule. ### Input A String containing 1s and 0s (
tl;dr: ## Your task: You need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer. ### Input A String containing 1s and 0s (1 <= Length <= 20)   A one stands for a taken urinal and a zero for a free one.  ### 

What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us  [Image] Nephren is playing a game with little leprechauns. She gives them an infinite array of strings, f_{0...  }. f_0 is "What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us ". She wants to let more people know about it, so she defines f_{i} =  "What are you doing while sending "f_{i} - 1"  Are you busy  Will you send "f_{i} - 1" " for all i   1. For example, f_1 is "What are you doing while sending "What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us "  Are you busy  Will you send "What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us " ". Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of f_1. It can be seen that the characters in f_{i} are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces. Nephren will ask the little leprechauns q times. Each time she will let them find the k-th character of f_{n}. The characters are indexed starting from 1. If f_{n} consists of less than k characters, output '.' (without quotes). Can you answer her queries
