A group of n cities is connected by a network of roads. There is an undirected road between every pair of cities, so there are $\frac{n \cdot(n - 1)}{2}$ roads in total. It takes exactly y seconds to traverse any single road. A spanning tree is a set of roads containing exactly n - 1 roads such that it's possible to travel between any two cities using only these roads. Some spanning tree of the initial network was chosen. For every road in this tree the time one needs to traverse this road was changed from y to x seconds. Note that it's not guaranteed that x is smaller than y. You would like to travel through all the cities using the shortest path possible. Given n, x, y and a description of the spanning tree that was chosen, find the cost of the shortest path that starts in any city, ends in any city and visits all cities exactly once.

Kate likes to count words in text blocks. By words she means continuous sequences of English alphabetic characters (from a to z ). Here are examples: `Hello there, little user5453 374 ())$. I d been using my sphere as a stool. Slow-moving target 839342 was hit by OMGd-63 or K4mp.` contains "words" `['Hello', 'there', 'little', 'user', 'I', 'd', 'been', 'using', 'my','sphere', 'as', 'a', 'stool', 'Slow', 'moving', 'target', 'was', 'hit', 'by', 'OMGd', 'or', 'K', 'mp']` Kate doesn't like some of words and doesn't count them. Words to be excluded are "a", "the", "on", "at", "of", "upon", "in" and "as", case-insensitive. Today Kate's too lazy and have decided to teach her computer to count "words" for her.

You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us  [Image] Nephren is playing a game with little leprechauns. She gives them an infinite array of strings, f_{0...  }. f_0 is "What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us ". She wants to let more people know about it, so she defines f_{i} =  "What are you doing while sending "f_{i} - 1"  Are you busy  Will you send "f_{i} - 1" " for all i   1. For example, f_1 is "What are you doing while sending "What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us "  Are you busy  Will you send "What are you doing at the end of the world  Are you busy  Will you save us " ". Note that the quotes in the very beginning and in the very end are for clarity and are not a part of f_1. It can be seen that the characters in f_{i} are letters, question marks, (possibly) quotation marks and spaces. Nephren will ask the little leprechauns q times. Each time she will let them find the k-th character of f_{n}. The characters are indexed starting from 1. If f_{n} consists of less than k characters, output '.' (without quotes). Can you answer her queries
