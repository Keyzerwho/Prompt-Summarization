On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon. A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1   l  r  n), then reverse a_{l}, a_{l} + 1, ..., a_{r} so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum. A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k}, such that p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{k} and a_{p}_1   a_{p}_2   ...   a_{p}_{k}. The length of the subsequence is k. \n",
