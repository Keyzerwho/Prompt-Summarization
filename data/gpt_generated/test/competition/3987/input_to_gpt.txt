Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him  Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.  
tl;dr: Given a two dimensional metrix of Latin letters, determine if the word "spoon" (case insensitive) appears in the matrix. 

A dragon symbolizes wisdom, power and wealth. On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon. A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1   l   r   n), then reverse a_{l}, a_{l} + 1, ..., a_{r} so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum. A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k}, such that p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{k} and a_{p}_1   a_{p}_2   ...   a_{p}_{k}. The length of the subsequence is k.
