 Given a sequence of numbers, reverse them and find the longest non-decreasing subsequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence. The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n). -----Output----- Print a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 1 2 Output 4 Input 10 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 Output 9 -----Note----- In the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4. In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.
