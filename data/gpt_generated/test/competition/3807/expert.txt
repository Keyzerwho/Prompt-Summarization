 You are given a number X. You are also given a number m. You are asked to find the maximum number of blocks that can be added to the tower and the maximum X that results this number of blocks. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains one integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^15), meaning that Limak wants you to choose X between 1 and m, inclusive. -----Output----- Print two integers — the maximum number of blocks in the tower and the maximum required total volume X, resulting in the maximum number of blocks. -----Examples----- Input 48 Output 9 42 Input 6 Output 6 6 -----Note----- In the first sample test, there will be 9 blocks if you choose X = 23 or X = 42. Limak wants to maximize X secondarily so you should choose 42. In more detail, after choosing X = 42 the process of building a tower is:  Limak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with volume not greater than 42. The remaining volume is 42 - 27 = 15.  The second added block has side 2, so the remaining volume is 15 - 8 = 7.  Finally, Limak adds 7 blocks with side 1, one by one.  So, there are 9 blocks in the tower. The total volume is is 3^3 + 2^3 + 7·1^3 = 27 + 8 + 7 = 42.
