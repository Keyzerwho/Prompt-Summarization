            "text": " Limak is a little polar bear. He plays by building towers from blocks. Every block is a cube with positive integer length of side. Limak has infinitely many blocks of each side length. A block with side a has volume a^3. A tower consisting of blocks with sides a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} has the total volume a_1^3 + a_2^3 + ... + a_{k}^3. Limak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer X the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed X. Limak asks you to choose X not greater than m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the end (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondary, he wants to maximize X. Can you help Limak find the maximum number of blocks his tower can have and the maximum X m that results this number of blocks.",
