You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

# Story You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee. Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on... But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work. To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in. # Kata Task Given the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted. #

Limak is a little polar bear. He plays by building towers from blocks. Every block is a cube with positive integer length of side. Limak has infinitely many blocks of each side length. A block with side a has volume a^3. A tower consisting of blocks with sides a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} has the total volume a_1^3 + a_2^3 + ... + a_{k}^3. Limak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell him a positive integer X   the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak adds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such that the total volume doesn't exceed X. Limak asks you to choose X not greater than m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the end (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondarily, he wants to maximize X. Can you help Limak  Find the maximum number of blocks his tower can have and the maximum X   m that results this number of blocks.
