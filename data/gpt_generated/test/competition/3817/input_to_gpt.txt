Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

A sequence of non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of length n is called a wool sequence if and only if there exists two integers l and r (1   l   r   n) such that $a_{l} \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \cdots \oplus a_{r} = 0$. In other words each wool sequence contains a subsequence of consecutive elements with xor equal to 0. The expression $x \oplus y$ means applying the operation of a bitwise xor to numbers x and y. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in languages C++ and Java it is marked as "^", in Pascal   as "xor". In this problem you are asked to compute the number of sequences made of n integers from 0 to 2^{m} - 1 that are not a wool sequence. You should print this number modulo 1000000009 (10^9 + 9).
