You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane.  Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.   
tl;dr: you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 

Chef wants you to distribute candies among $N$ kids who are sitting in a circle. However, he wants to make some kids jealous of others. Thus, he wants you to distribute candies in such a way that there is a difference of at least $K$ candies between two adjacent kids.  Given the value of $N$ and $K$, you need to find the minimum number of candies you need to satisfy the given conditions, such that, each kid gets at least one candy. 
tl;dr: You are given $N$ nodes arranged in a cycle initialised to zero and a difference $K$.  Find and return the minimum number of increments required so that each node is atleast $1$ and adjacent nodes have a difference of is atleast $K$. 

You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide. We will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good. The angle between vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\operatorname{arccos}(\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\vec{y}|})$, where $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\vec{x}|= \sqrt{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is length of $\vec{x}$. Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.

Artsem has a friend Saunders from University of Chicago. Saunders presented him with the following problem. Let [n] denote the set {1, ..., n}. We will also write f: [x]   [y] when a function f is defined in integer points 1, ..., x, and all its values are integers from 1 to y. Now then, you are given a function f: [n]   [n]. Your task is to find a positive integer m, and two functions g: [n]   [m], h: [m]   [n], such that g(h(x)) = x for all $x \in [ m ]$, and h(g(x)) = f(x) for all $x \in [ n ]$, or determine that finding these is impossible.
