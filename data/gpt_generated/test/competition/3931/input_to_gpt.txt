Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes. 
tl;dr: Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes. 

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.  I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n)  returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For example: ```python    nth_fib(4) == 2 ``` Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
tl;dr: Write a function that when given a number n, returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence. 

In the evening Polycarp decided to analyze his today's travel expenses on public transport. The bus system in the capital of Berland is arranged in such a way that each bus runs along the route between two stops. Each bus has no intermediate stops. So each of the buses continuously runs along the route from one stop to the other and back. There is at most one bus running between a pair of stops. Polycarp made n trips on buses. About each trip the stop where he started the trip and the the stop where he finished are known. The trips follow in the chronological order in Polycarp's notes. It is known that one trip on any bus costs a burles. In case when passenger makes a transshipment the cost of trip decreases to b burles (b < a). A passenger makes a transshipment if the stop on which he boards the bus coincides with the stop where he left the previous bus. Obviously, the first trip can not be made with transshipment. For example, if Polycarp made three consecutive trips: "BerBank" $\rightarrow$ "University", "University" $\rightarrow$ "BerMall", "University" $\rightarrow$ "BerBank", then he payed a + b + a = 2a + b burles. From the BerBank he arrived to the University, where he made transshipment to the other bus and departed to the BerMall. Then he walked to the University and returned to the BerBank by bus. Also Polycarp can buy no more than k travel cards. Each travel card costs f burles. The travel card for a single bus route makes free of charge any trip by this route (in both directions). Once purchased, a travel card can be used any number of times in any direction. What is the smallest amount of money Polycarp could have spent today if he can buy no more than k travel cards
