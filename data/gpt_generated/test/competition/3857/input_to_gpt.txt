Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input. 
tl;dr: Your task is to write a function get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) which returns a dictionary {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} 

Given an array containing only zeros and ones, find the index of the zero that, if converted to one, will make the longest sequence of ones. For instance, given the array: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ``` replacing the zero at index 10 (counting from 0) forms a sequence of 9 ones: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]                   '------------^------------' ``` Your task is to complete the function that determines where to replace a zero with a one to make the maximum length subsequence. **

Fox Ciel has n boxes in her room. They have the same size and weight, but they might have different strength. The i-th box can hold at most x_{i} boxes on its top (we'll call x_{i} the strength of the box).  Since all the boxes have the same size, Ciel cannot put more than one box directly on the top of some box. For example, imagine Ciel has three boxes: the first has strength 2, the second has strength 1 and the third has strength 1. She cannot put the second and the third box simultaneously directly on the top of the first one. But she can put the second box directly on the top of the first one, and then the third box directly on the top of the second one. We will call such a construction of boxes a pile.[Image] Fox Ciel wants to construct piles from all the boxes. Each pile will contain some boxes from top to bottom, and there cannot be more than x_{i} boxes on the top of i-th box. What is the minimal number of piles she needs to construct
