**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #16 Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the **first** not repeated character in the entire string. ``` haskell noRepeat "aabbccdde" `shouldBe` 'e' noRepeat "wxyz"      `shouldBe` 'w' noRepeat "testing"   `shouldBe` 'e' ``` 
tl;dr: Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the first not repeated character in the entire string. 

Sasha likes programming. Once, during a very long contest, Sasha decided that he was a bit tired and needed to relax. So he did. But since Sasha isn't an ordinary guy, he prefers to relax unusually. During leisure time Sasha likes to upsolve unsolved problems because upsolving is very useful. Therefore, Sasha decided to upsolve the following problem: You have an array $a$ with $n$ integers. You need to count the number of funny pairs $(l, r)$ $(l \leq r)$. To check if a pair $(l, r)$ is a funny pair, take $mid = \frac{l + r - 1}{2}$, then if $r - l + 1$ is an even number and $a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{mid} = a_{mid + 1} \oplus a_{mid + 2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r$, then the pair is funny. In other words, $\oplus$ of elements of the left half of the subarray from $l$ to $r$ should be equal to $\oplus$ of elements of the right half. Note that $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. It is time to continue solving the contest, so Sasha asked you to solve this task.

Chef has a natural number N. Cheffina challenges chef to check whether the given number is divisible by the sum of its digits or not. If the given number is divisible then print "Yes" else "No". 
tl;dr: Check whether the given natural number N is divisible by the sum of its digits or not. If possible, then print "Yes" else "No". 

Fox Ciel has n boxes in her room. They have the same size and weight, but they might have different strength. The i-th box can hold at most x_{i} boxes on its top (we'll call x_{i} the strength of the box).  Since all the boxes have the same size, Ciel cannot put more than one box directly on the top of some box. For example, imagine Ciel has three boxes: the first has strength 2, the second has strength 1 and the third has strength 1. She cannot put the second and the third box simultaneously directly on the top of the first one. But she can put the second box directly on the top of the first one, and then the third box directly on the top of the second one. We will call such a construction of boxes a pile.[Image] Fox Ciel wants to construct piles from all the boxes. Each pile will contain some boxes from top to bottom, and there cannot be more than x_{i} boxes on the top of i-th box. What is the minimal number of piles she needs to construct
