Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that: Every song is played at least once A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.   
tl;dr: You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Polycarp is reading a book consisting of $n$ pages numbered from $1$ to $n$. Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by $m$, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, pages divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. Your task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down. You have to answer $q$ independent queries. 
tl;dr: You are given a number $n$ and a value $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $m$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 

Jeff got 2n real numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n as a birthday present. The boy hates non-integer numbers, so he decided to slightly "adjust" the numbers he's got. Namely, Jeff consecutively executes n operations, each of them goes as follows:  choose indexes i and j (i   j) that haven't been chosen yet;  round element a_{i} to the nearest integer that isn't more than a_{i} (assign to a_{i}:   a_{i}  );  round element a_{j} to the nearest integer that isn't less than a_{j} (assign to a_{j}:   a_{j}  ).  Nevertheless, Jeff doesn't want to hurt the feelings of the person who gave him the sequence. That's why the boy wants to perform the operations so as to make the absolute value of the difference between the sum of elements before performing the operations and the sum of elements after performing the operations as small as possible. Help Jeff find the minimum absolute value of the difference.
