Mr. E Ven only likes even length words. Please create a translator so that he doesn't have to hear those pesky odd length words. For some reason he also hates punctuation, he likes his sentences to flow. Your translator should take in a string and output it with all odd length words having an extra letter (the last letter in the word). It should also remove all punctuation (., !) as well as any underscores (_). "How did we end up here  We go " translated becomes->  "Howw didd we endd up here We go
tl;dr: Your translator should take in a string and output it with all odd length words having an extra letter that is the last letter in the word. It should also remove all punctuation as well as any underscores. 

Saket loves to play with strings. One day , while he was having fun with Cyclic Permutations of available strings to him, he observed that despite being scarce in numbers Vowels were really clingy.Being clingy means for almost every given string, there was a Cyclic Permutation in which atleast two vowels were together. So he decided to check this property for all the available strings to him. As the number of strings can be very large, help Saket determine whether the given string is clingy or not. 
tl;dr: Given a string return "Yes" if there are two vowels adjacent in it (first and last letter are adjacent), "No" otherwise.

Polycarpus just has been out of luck lately! As soon as he found a job in the "Binary Cat" cafe, the club got burgled. All ice-cream was stolen. On the burglary night Polycarpus kept a careful record of all club visitors. Each time a visitor entered the club, Polycarpus put down character "+" in his notes. Similarly, each time a visitor left the club, Polycarpus put character "-" in his notes. We know that all cases of going in and out happened consecutively, that is, no two events happened at the same time. Polycarpus doesn't remember whether there was somebody in the club at the moment when his shift begun and at the moment when it ended. Right now the police wonders what minimum number of distinct people Polycarpus could have seen. Assume that he sees anybody coming in or out of the club. Each person could have come in or out an arbitrary number of times.
