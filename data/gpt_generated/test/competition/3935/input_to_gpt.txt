You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

You are the principal of the Cake school in chefland and today is your birthday. You want to treat each of the children with a small cupcake which is made by you. But there is a problem, You don't know how many students are present today. The students have gathered of the morning assembly in $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Now you have to calculate how many cakes you have to make such that each child gets a cupcake.  
tl;dr: You are given $R$ rows and $C$ columns of a matrix. Calculate the total number in the matrix.  

Boy Dima gave Julian a birthday present   set $B$ consisting of positive integers. However, he didn't know, that Julian hates sets, but enjoys bipartite graphs more than anything else! Julian was almost upset, but her friend Alex said, that he can build an undirected graph using this set in such a way: let all integer numbers be vertices, then connect any two $i$ and $j$ with an edge if $|i - j|$ belongs to $B$. Unfortunately, Julian doesn't like the graph, that was built using $B$. Alex decided to rectify the situation, so he wants to erase some numbers from $B$, so that graph built using the new set is bipartite. The difficulty of this task is that the graph, Alex has to work with, has an infinite number of vertices and edges! It is impossible to solve this task alone, so Alex asks you for help. Write a program that erases a subset of minimum size from $B$ so that graph constructed on the new set is bipartite. Recall, that graph is bipartite if all its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from different sets.
