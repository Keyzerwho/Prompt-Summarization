*This kata is inspired by [Project Euler Problem #387](https://projecteuler.net/problem=387)* --- A [Harshad number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number) (or Niven number) is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits. A *right truncatable Harshad number* is any Harshad number that, when recursively right-truncated, results in a Harshad number at each truncation. By definition, 1-digit numbers are **not** right truncatable Harshad numbers. For example `201` (which is a Harshad number) yields `20`, then `2` when right-truncated, which are all Harshad numbers. Thus `201` is a *right truncatable Harshad number*. ## Your task Given a range of numbers (`(a, b)`, both included), return the list of right truncatable Harshad numbers in this range. ```if-not:javascript

The chef won a duet singing award at Techsurge & Mridang 2012. From that time he is obsessed with the number 2. He just started calculating the powers of two. And adding the digits of the results. But he got puzzled after a few calculations. So gave you the job to generate the solutions to 2^n and find their sum of digits. 
tl;dr: Obtain the solutions to 2^n for a given n and display their sum of digits. 

Complete the function that determines the score of a hand in the card game [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) (aka 21). The function receives an array of strings that represent each card in the hand (`"2"`, `"3",` ..., `"10"`, `"J"`, `"Q"`, `"K"` or `"A"`) and should return the score of the hand (integer). ~~~if:c 
tl;dr: Complete the function that determines the score of a hand in the card game Blackjack and return the highest score of the cards that is less than or equal to 21. If there is no score less than or equal to 21 return the smallest score more than 21. Number cards count as their face value. Jack, Queen and King count as 10. An Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11. 

Boy Dima gave Julian a birthday present   set $B$ consisting of positive integers. However, he didn't know, that Julian hates sets, but enjoys bipartite graphs more than anything else! Julian was almost upset, but her friend Alex said, that he can build an undirected graph using this set in such a way: let all integer numbers be vertices, then connect any two $i$ and $j$ with an edge if $|i - j|$ belongs to $B$. Unfortunately, Julian doesn't like the graph, that was built using $B$. Alex decided to rectify the situation, so he wants to erase some numbers from $B$, so that graph built using the new set is bipartite. The difficulty of this task is that the graph, Alex has to work with, has an infinite number of vertices and edges! It is impossible to solve this task alone, so Alex asks you for help. Write a program that erases a subset of minimum size from $B$ so that graph constructed on the new set is bipartite. Recall, that graph is bipartite if all its vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from different sets.
