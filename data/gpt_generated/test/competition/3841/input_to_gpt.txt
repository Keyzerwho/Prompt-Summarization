There are n cards of different colours placed in a line, each of them can be either red, green or blue cards. Count the minimum number of cards to withdraw from the line so that no two adjacent cards have the same colour. 
tl;dr: You are given n cards of 3 different colours placed in a line. Count the minimum number of cards to withdraw from the line so that no two adjacent cards have the same colour. 

Sasha likes programming. Once, during a very long contest, Sasha decided that he was a bit tired and needed to relax. So he did. But since Sasha isn't an ordinary guy, he prefers to relax unusually. During leisure time Sasha likes to upsolve unsolved problems because upsolving is very useful. Therefore, Sasha decided to upsolve the following problem: You have an array $a$ with $n$ integers. You need to count the number of funny pairs $(l, r)$ $(l \leq r)$. To check if a pair $(l, r)$ is a funny pair, take $mid = \frac{l + r - 1}{2}$, then if $r - l + 1$ is an even number and $a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{mid} = a_{mid + 1} \oplus a_{mid + 2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r$, then the pair is funny. In other words, $\oplus$ of elements of the left half of the subarray from $l$ to $r$ should be equal to $\oplus$ of elements of the right half. Note that $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. It is time to continue solving the contest, so Sasha asked you to solve this task.

In order to put away old things and welcome a fresh new year, a thorough cleaning of the house is a must. Little Tommy finds an old polynomial and cleaned it up by taking it modulo another. But now he regrets doing this... Given two integers p and k, find a polynomial f(x) with non-negative integer coefficients strictly less than k, whose remainder is p when divided by (x + k). That is, f(x) = q(x) (x + k) + p, where q(x) is a polynomial (not necessarily with integer coefficients).
