Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

In order to put away old things and welcome a fresh new year, a thorough cleaning of the house is a must. Little Tommy finds an old polynomial and cleaned it up by taking it modulo another. But now he regrets doing this... Given two integers p and k, find a polynomial f(x) with non-negative integer coefficients strictly less than k, whose remainder is p when divided by (x + k). That is, f(x) = q(x) (x + k) + p, where q(x) is a polynomial (not necessarily with integer coefficients).
