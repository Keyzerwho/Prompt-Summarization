            "text": " Petya's friends made him a birthday present a bracket sequence. Petya was quite disappointed with his gift, because he dreamed of correct bracket sequence, yet he told his friends nothing about his dreams and decided to fix present himself. To make everything right, Petya is going to move at most one bracket from its original place in the sequence to any other position. Reversing the bracket (e.g. turning \"(\" into \")\" or vice versa) isn't allowed. We remind that bracket sequence $s$ is called correct if: $s$ is empty; $s$ is equal to \"($t$)\", where $t$ is correct bracket sequence; $s$ is equal to $t_1 t_2$, i.e. concatenation of $t_1$ and $t_2$, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are correct bracket sequences. For example, \"(()())\", \"()\" are correct, while \")(\" and \"())\" are not. Help Petya to fix his birthday present and understand whether he can move one bracket so that the sequence becomes correct.",
