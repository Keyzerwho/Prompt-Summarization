 You have a bracket sequence. You can move at most one bracket from its original place in the sequence to any other position. Reversing the bracket (e.g. turning "(" into ")" or vice versa) isn't allowed. You need to fix the sequence so that it becomes correct. 
-----Input----- First of line of input contains a single number $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$) — length of the sequence which Petya received for his birthday. Second line of the input contains bracket sequence of length $n$, containing symbols "(" and ")". -----Output----- Print "Yes" if Petya can make his sequence correct moving at most one bracket. Otherwise print "No". -----Examples----- Input 2 )( Output Yes Input 3 (() Output No Input 2 () Output Yes Input 10 )))))((((( Output No -----Note----- In the first example, Petya can move first bracket to the end, thus turning the sequence into "()", which is correct bracket sequence. In the second example, there is no way to move at most one bracket so that the sequence becomes correct. In the third example, the sequence is already correct and there's no need to move brackets.
