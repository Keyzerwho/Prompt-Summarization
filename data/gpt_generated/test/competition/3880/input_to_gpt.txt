You are given a string s of length n. Does a tree with n vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., n.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., n-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - If the i-th character in s is 1, we can have a connected component of size i by removing one edge from the tree.  - If the i-th character in s is 0, we cannot have a connected component of size i by removing any one edge from the tree. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq n \leq 10^5  - s is a string of length n consisting of 0 and 1.

You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane.  Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.   
tl;dr: you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 

You have initially a string of N characters, denoted by A1,A2...AN. You have to print the size of the largest subsequence of string A such that all the characters in that subsequence are distinct ie. no two characters in that subsequence should be same. A subsequence of string A is a sequence that can be derived from A by deleting some elements  and without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
tl;dr: You have to remove duplicates and print the length of unique characters of the given string. 

Yaroslav has an array, consisting of (2 n - 1) integers. In a single operation Yaroslav can change the sign of exactly n elements in the array. In other words, in one operation Yaroslav can select exactly n array elements, and multiply each of them by -1. Yaroslav is now wondering: what maximum sum of array elements can be obtained if it is allowed to perform any number of described operations  Help Yaroslav.
