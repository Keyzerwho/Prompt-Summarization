You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers. For instance, if we are given an array $[10, 20, 30, 40]$, we can permute it so that it becomes $[20, 40, 10, 30]$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($20>10$, $40>20$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $2$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case. Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of integers. You can permute its integers. You want to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Find the maximal number of such integers. 

-----General Statement:----- Given the actual high and low temperatures for the day and the normal high and low temperatures for that day, calculate the average difference from normal. 
tl;dr: Determine the average of the difference of the high temperatures and the difference of the low temperatures. 

Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order. Iroha is looking for X,Y,Z-Haiku (defined below) in integer sequences. Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku  Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0   x < y < z < w   N) such that all of the following are satisfied:  - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X  - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y  - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Since the answer can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 3   N   40  - 1   X   5  - 1   Y   7  - 1   Z   5

You are given an array of positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}   T of length n   T. We know that for any i > n it is true that a_{i} = a_{i} - n. Find the length of the longest non-decreasing sequence of the given array.
