It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this! Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one. Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left. One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation:  (n)   the number of primes no larger than n, rub(n)   the number of palindromic numbers no larger than n. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones. He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient A find the maximum n, such that  (n)   A rub(n). ",
