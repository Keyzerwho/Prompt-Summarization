You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening  Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages. These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before: * hello - english * ciao - italian * salut - french * hallo - german * hola - spanish * ahoj - czech republic * czesc - polish By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!! PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test) PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the test
tl;dr: Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hello in different languages. Regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests

Mr. E Ven only likes even length words. Please create a translator so that he doesn't have to hear those pesky odd length words. For some reason he also hates punctuation, he likes his sentences to flow. Your translator should take in a string and output it with all odd length words having an extra letter (the last letter in the word). It should also remove all punctuation (., !) as well as any underscores (_). "How did we end up here  We go " translated becomes->  "Howw didd we endd up here We go
tl;dr: Your translator should take in a string and output it with all odd length words having an extra letter that is the last letter in the word. It should also remove all punctuation as well as any underscores. 

Rikhail Mubinchik believes that the current definition of prime numbers is obsolete as they are too complex and unpredictable. A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this! Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one. Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left. One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation:  (n)   the number of primes no larger than n, rub(n)   the number of palindromic numbers no larger than n. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones. He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient A find the maximum n, such that  (n)   A rub(n).
