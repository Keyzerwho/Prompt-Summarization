We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.   Each glass holds one cup (250ml) of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.   When the top most glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.   When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has it's excess champagne fall on the floor.) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.   After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.   After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.   After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below. Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is (both i and j are 0 indexed.)   
tl;dr: You are given glasses stacked in a pyramid. You need to output how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is when champagne is poured in the first glass at the top. Glasses poured will be in the range of [0, 10 ^ 9]. i and j will be in the range of [0, 99]. 

Stuart is obsessed to numbers. He like all type of numbers in fact he is having a great collection of numbers in his room. His collection includes N different large numbers. But today he is searching for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X. Numbers are large so he can t do the task on his own. Help him to find a number having maximum frequency of digit X. 
tl;dr: Write a code to search for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X in given different numbers.  

You are given a sequence of $n$ digits $d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}$. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:  each digit is painted either in the color $1$ or in the color $2$;  if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $1$, and then after them all the digits painted in the color $2$, then the resulting sequence of $n$ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).  For example, for the sequence $d=914$ the only valid coloring is $211$ (paint in the color $1$ two last digits, paint in the color $2$ the first digit). But $122$ is not a valid coloring ($9$ concatenated with $14$ is not a non-decreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

Rikhail Mubinchik believes that the current definition of prime numbers is obsolete as they are too complex and unpredictable. A palindromic number is another matter. It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this! Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one. Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left. One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation:  (n)   the number of primes no larger than n, rub(n)   the number of palindromic numbers no larger than n. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones. He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient A find the maximum n, such that  (n)   A rub(n).
