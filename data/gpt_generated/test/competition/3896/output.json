            "text": " As a tradition, every year before IOI all the members of Natalia Fan Club are invited to Malek Dance Club to have a fun night together. Malek Dance Club has 2^{n} members and coincidentally Natalia Fan Club also has 2^{n} members. Each member of MDC is assigned a unique id i from 0 to 2^{n} - 1. The same holds for each member of NFC. One of the parts of this tradition is one by one dance, where each member of MDC dances with a member of NFC. A dance pair is a pair of numbers (a, b) such that member a from MDC dances with member b from NFC. The complexity of a pairs' assignment is the number of pairs of dancing pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that a < c and b > d. You are given a binary number of length n named x. We know that member i from MDC dances with member $i \\oplus x$ from NFC. Your task is to calculate the complexity of this assignment modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Expression $x \\oplus y$ denotes applying \u00a0XOR \u00a0to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in C++ and Java it denotes as \u00a0^ , in Pascal \u00a0 \u00a0xor . ",
