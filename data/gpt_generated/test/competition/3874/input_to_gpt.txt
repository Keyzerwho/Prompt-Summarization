It's Friday night, and Chuck is bored. He's already run 1,000 miles, stopping only to eat a family sized bag of Heatwave Doritos and a large fistful of M&Ms. He just can't stop thinking about kicking something!  There is only one thing for it, Chuck heads down to his local MMA gym and immediately challenges every fighter there to get in the cage and try and take him down... AT THE SAME TIME!  You are provided an array of strings that represent the cage and Chuck's opponents. Your task, in traditional Chuck style, is to take their heads off!! Throw punches, kicks, headbutts (or more likely - regex or iteration...) but whatever you do, remove their heads. Return the same array of strings, but with the heads ('O') removed and replaced with a space (' '). If the provided array is empty, or is an empty string, return 'Gym is empty'. If you are given an array of numbers, return 'This isn't the gym!!'. FIGHT!! *Original design of this kata was a much more beautiful thing - the test cases illustrate the idea, and the intended output. I am unable to make the actual output go over multiple lines so for now at least you will have to imagine the beauty!

# Story Due to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face. And because the local council has lost most of our tax money to a Nigerian email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly.  Instead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand! What a bunch of cheapskates! Can you do it  # Kata Given the ```angle``` (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format. Round _down_ to the nearest minute. # 
tl;dr: Given the angle of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format and round down to the nearest minute. 0 <= angle <= 360 # 

Little X has n distinct integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. He wants to divide all of them into two sets A and B. The following two conditions must be satisfied:  If number x belongs to set A, then number a - x must also belong to set A.  If number x belongs to set B, then number b - x must also belong to set B.  Help Little X divide the numbers into two sets or determine that it's impossible.

Polycarp is a beginner programmer. He is studying how to use a command line. Polycarp faced the following problem. There are n files in a directory and he needs to delete some of them. Polycarp wants to run a single delete command with filename pattern as an argument. All the files to be deleted should match the pattern and all other files shouldn't match the pattern. Polycarp doesn't know about an asterisk '*', the only special character he knows is a question mark ' ' which matches any single character. All other characters in the pattern match themselves only. Formally, a pattern matches a filename if and only if they have equal lengths and all characters in the corresponding positions are equal except when the character in the pattern is ' ', in which case the corresponding filename character does not matter. For example, the filename pattern "a ba ":  matches filenames "aabaa", "abba.", "a.ba9" and "a.ba.";  does not match filenames "aaba", "abaab", "aabaaa" and "aabaa.".  Help Polycarp find a pattern which matches files to be deleted and only them or report if there is no such pattern.
