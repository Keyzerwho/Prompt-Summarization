You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $A$, $B$ and $C$.  Find the number of different groups of three integers ($a$, $b$, $c$) such that $1\leq a\leq b\leq c$ and parallelepiped $A\times B\times C$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $a\times b\times c$. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction. For example, parallelepiped $1\times 5\times 6$ can be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 3\times 5$, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 2\times 3$.

Heidi is a statistician to the core, and she likes to study the evolution of marmot populations in each of V (1   V   100) villages! So it comes that every spring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her barn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome her friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures. Arriving in a village, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of inhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April Fools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of inhabitants P (10   P   1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-negative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:   Poisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{p^{k} e^{-P}}{k !}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,  Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{1}{2 P + 1}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P.  Heidi collects exactly 250 answers per village. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution. Heidi cannot tell marmots apart, so she may query some marmots several times, and each time the marmot will answer with a new number drawn from the village's distribution. Can you help Heidi to find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
tl;dr: The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  

It's that time of the year, Felicity is around the corner and you can see people celebrating all around the Himalayan region. The Himalayan region has n gyms. The i-th gym has g_{i} Pokemon in it. There are m distinct Pokemon types in the Himalayan region numbered from 1 to m. There is a special evolution camp set up in the fest which claims to evolve any Pokemon. The type of a Pokemon could change after evolving, subject to the constraint that if two Pokemon have the same type before evolving, they will have the same type after evolving. Also, if two Pokemon have different types before evolving, they will have different types after evolving. It is also possible that a Pokemon has the same type before and after evolving.  Formally, an evolution plan is a permutation f of {1, 2, ..., m}, such that f(x) = y means that a Pokemon of type x evolves into a Pokemon of type y. The gym leaders are intrigued by the special evolution camp and all of them plan to evolve their Pokemons. The protocol of the mountain states that in each gym, for every type of Pokemon, the number of Pokemon of that type before evolving any Pokemon should be equal the number of Pokemon of that type after evolving all the Pokemons according to the evolution plan. They now want to find out how many distinct evolution plans exist which satisfy the protocol. Two evolution plans f_1 and f_2 are distinct, if they have at least one Pokemon type evolving into a different Pokemon type in the two plans, i. e. there exists an i such that f_1(i)   f_2(i). Your task is to find how many distinct evolution plans are possible such that if all Pokemon in all the gyms are evolved, the number of Pokemon of each type in each of the gyms remains the same. As the answer can be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7.
