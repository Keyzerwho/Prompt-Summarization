This is a peculiar functioning setup. Two Tanks are separated from each other by a wall .There is a pipe in the wall which connects  both tanks  which allows flow of water between them . Due to this ,there is change in temperature of both tanks , every minute temperature of Tank with larger temperature among two decreases by one and temperature of Tank  with smaller temperature among two increases by two until equilibrium is reached , But there is a problem . The pipe can't control this flow of water if there is Non-equilibrium (inequality of temperature  on  both sides )  even after $m$ minutes and the pipe will burst after it , your task is to predict whether the pipe will burst or not . 
tl;dr: Given numbers $m$, $Tc$, $Th$.  If the difference between $Tc$ and $Th$ is not divisible by $3$, return "Yes". Else if the differnce divided by $3$ is more than $m$ return "Yes".  Else return "No". 

You are given a string $s$ of even length $n$. String $s$ is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's. String $s$ has exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ zeroes and $\frac{n}{2}$ ones ($n$ is even). In one operation you can reverse any substring of $s$. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string $s$ alternating  A string is alternating if $s_i \neq s_{i + 1}$ for all $i$. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...

There are two strings s and t, consisting only of letters a and b. You can make the following operation several times: choose a prefix of s, a prefix of t and swap them. Prefixes can be empty, also a prefix can coincide with a whole string.  Your task is to find a sequence of operations after which one of the strings consists only of a letters and the other consists only of b letters. The number of operations should be minimized.
