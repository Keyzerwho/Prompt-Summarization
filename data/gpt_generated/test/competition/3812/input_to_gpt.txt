Give me Chocolate Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices. Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money. Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy   For example,  if prices =[1,2,3,4] and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend. The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= prices[i] <= 109 A chocolate can't be bought multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 4 Explanation she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most. These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10
tl;dr: You are given an array of size n and a limiting number k. Find the maximum count of numbers from array whose sum is not greater than k. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of elements in array and a limiting number. The next line contains n space-separated integers array[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= array[i] <= 109 A number can't be repeated multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum count of array numbers whose sum can't be greater than k. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 

We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.   Each glass holds one cup (250ml) of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured in the first glass at the top.   When the top most glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.   When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has it's excess champagne fall on the floor.) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.   After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.   After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.   After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below. Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is (both i and j are 0 indexed.)   
tl;dr: You are given glasses stacked in a pyramid. You need to output how full the j-th glass in the i-th row is when champagne is poured in the first glass at the top. Glasses poured will be in the range of [0, 10 ^ 9]. i and j will be in the range of [0, 99]. 

There are two strings s and t, consisting only of letters a and b. You can make the following operation several times: choose a prefix of s, a prefix of t and swap them. Prefixes can be empty, also a prefix can coincide with a whole string.  Your task is to find a sequence of operations after which one of the strings consists only of a letters and the other consists only of b letters. The number of operations should be minimized.
