The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for $130$ years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem! 
tl;dr: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  

You are given n strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} consisting of characters 0 and 1. m operations are performed, on each of them you concatenate two existing strings into a new one. On the i-th operation the concatenation s_{a}_{i}s_{b}_{i} is saved into a new string s_{n} + i (the operations are numbered starting from 1). After each operation you need to find the maximum positive integer k such that all possible strings consisting of 0 and 1 of length k (there are 2^{k} such strings) are substrings of the new string. If there is no such k, print 0.

Welcome to Innopolis city. Throughout the whole year, Innopolis citizens suffer from everlasting city construction.  From the window in your room, you see the sequence of n hills, where i-th of them has height a_{i}. The Innopolis administration wants to build some houses on the hills. However, for the sake of city appearance, a house can be only built on the hill, which is strictly higher than neighbouring hills (if they are present). For example, if the sequence of heights is 5, 4, 6, 2, then houses could be built on hills with heights 5 and 6 only. The Innopolis administration has an excavator, that can decrease the height of an arbitrary hill by one in one hour. The excavator can only work on one hill at a time. It is allowed to decrease hills up to zero height, or even to negative values. Increasing height of any hill is impossible. The city administration wants to build k houses, so there must be at least k hills that satisfy the condition above. What is the minimum time required to adjust the hills to achieve the administration's plan  However, the exact value of k is not yet determined, so could you please calculate answers for all k in range $1 \leq k \leq \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$  Here $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ denotes n divided by two, rounded up.
