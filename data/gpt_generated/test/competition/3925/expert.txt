 You are given a sequence of black and white stripes. You can split the sequence in some place into two parts, then reverses each of them and sticks them together again. Determine the maximum possible length of the zebra that you can produce. 
-----Input----- The only line contains a string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 10^5$, where $|s|$ denotes the length of the string $s$) comprised of lowercase English letters 'b' and 'w' only, where 'w' denotes a white piece and 'b' denotes a black piece. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum possible zebra length. -----Examples----- Input bwwwbwwbw Output 5 Input bwwbwwb Output 3 -----Note----- In the first example one of the possible sequence of operations is bwwwbww|bw $\to$ w|wbwwwbwb $\to$ wbwbwwwbw, that gives the answer equal to $5$. In the second example no operation can increase the answer.
