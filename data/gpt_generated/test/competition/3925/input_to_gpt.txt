$Neha$  is given a number $N$. She always looks for special thing , this time she is looking for $Special$ $Number$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Number$. A $Special$ $Number$ is a number whose product of its digits is equal to number itself i.e. $N $, and in this number there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it .Neha have to count the number of $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ . She is not so good in programming , so go and help her. 
tl;dr: You have to find a $Special$ $Number$  and a $Partial$ special number for a number N.Special Number are those product of its digits is equal to number itself and there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it. Print the count of the $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ .  

The objective of this Kata is to write a function that creates a dictionary of factors for a range of numbers. The key for each list in the dictionary should be the number. The list associated with each key should possess the factors for the number. If a number possesses no factors (only 1 and the number itself), the list for the key should be `['None']` The function possesses two arguments (`n` and `m`). Where `n` is the starting number and `m` is the ending number. For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``
tl;dr: Given starting number and the ending number, creates a dictionary of factors for all numbers. If a number possesses no factors , the list for the key should be `['None']` For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``

Richik$Richik$ has just completed his engineering and has got a job in one of the firms at Sabrina$Sabrina$ which is ranked among the top seven islands in the world in terms of the pay scale.  Since Richik$Richik$ has to travel a lot to reach the firm, the owner assigns him a number X$X$, and asks him to come to work only on the day which is a multiple of X$X$. Richik joins the firm on 1-st day but starts working from X-th day. Richik$Richik$ is paid exactly the same amount in Dollars as the day number. For example, if Richik$Richik$ has been assigned X=3$X = 3$, then he will be paid 3$3$ dollars and 6$6$ dollars on the 3rd$3rd$ and 6th$6th$ day on which he comes for work.  On N th$N-th$ day, the owner calls up Richik$Richik$ and asks him not to come to his firm anymore. Hence Richik$Richik$ demands his salary of all his working days together. Since it will take a lot of time to add, Richik$Richik$ asks help from people around him, let's see if you can help him out.  
tl;dr: You are given a number X and limit N. You need to output the sum of multiples of X upto N. 

Is there anything better than going to the zoo after a tiresome week at work  No wonder Grisha feels the same while spending the entire weekend accompanied by pretty striped zebras.  Inspired by this adventure and an accidentally found plasticine pack (represented as a sequence of black and white stripes), Grisha now wants to select several consequent (contiguous) pieces of alternating colors to create a zebra. Let's call the number of selected pieces the length of the zebra. Before assembling the zebra Grisha can make the following operation $0$ or more times. He splits the sequence in some place into two parts, then reverses each of them and sticks them together again. For example, if Grisha has pieces in the order "bwbbw" (here 'b' denotes a black strip, and 'w' denotes a white strip), then he can split the sequence as bw|bbw (here the vertical bar represents the cut), reverse both parts and obtain "wbwbb". Determine the maximum possible length of the zebra that Grisha can produce.
