Codefortia is a small island country located somewhere in the West Pacific. It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads. Codefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:   it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible.  The king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned  
tl;dr: You are given a connected graph of $n$ nodes and $m$ bidirectional edges. For each node $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, you need to find a minimum spanning tree. Then output the minimum cost required to travel between node $1$ and node $p$. 

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv has an array A that consists of N positive integers. Let A[i] be the i-th number in this array (i = 1, 2, ..., N). Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A. More formally, this x should satisfy the following relations: A[1] mod x = 0, A[2] mod x = 0, ..., A[N] mod x = 0, where mod stands for the modulo operation. For example,  8 mod 3 = 2,  2 mod 2 = 0, 100 mod 5 = 0 and so on. If such number does not exist, output -1. 
tl;dr: You are given an array A that consists of N positive integers. Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A.  If such number does not exist, output -1. 

For integers b (b \geq 2) and n (n \geq 1), let the function f(b,n) be defined as follows:  - f(b,n) = n, when n < b  - f(b,n) = f(b,\,{\rm floor}(n / b)) + (n \ {\rm mod} \ b), when n \geq b Here, {\rm floor}(n / b) denotes the largest integer not exceeding n / b, and n \ {\rm mod} \ b denotes the remainder of n divided by b. Less formally, f(b,n) is equal to the sum of the digits of n written in base b. For example, the following hold:  - f(10,\,87654)=8+7+6+5+4=30  - f(100,\,87654)=8+76+54=138 You are given integers n and s. Determine if there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s. If the answer is positive, also find the smallest such b. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq n \leq 10^{11}  - 1 \leq s \leq 10^{11}  - n,\,s are integers.
