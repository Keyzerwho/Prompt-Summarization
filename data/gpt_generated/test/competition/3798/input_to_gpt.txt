## Task: You have to create a function `isPronic` to check whether the argument passed is a Pronic Number and return true if it is & false otherwise. ### Description: `Pronic Number` -A pronic number, oblong number, rectangular number or heteromecic number, is a number which is the product of two consecutive integers, that is, n(n + 1). > The first few Pronic Numbers are - 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42... ### Explanation:            0 = 0   1   //    0 is a Pronic Number       2 = 1   2   //    2 is a Pronic Number       6 = 2   3   //    6 is a Pronic Number      12 = 3   4   //   12 is a Pronic Number      20 = 4   5   //   20 is a Pronic Number      30 = 5   6   //   30 is a Pronic Number      42 = 6   7   //   42 is a Pronic Numbe

Recently, Pari and Arya did some research about NP-Hard problems and they found the minimum vertex cover problem very interesting. Suppose the graph G is given. Subset A of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge uv there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. $u \in A$ or $v \in A$ (or both). Pari and Arya have won a great undirected graph as an award in a team contest. Now they have to split it in two parts, but both of them want their parts of the graph to be a vertex cover. They have agreed to give you their graph and you need to find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex cover or claim it's impossible. Each vertex should be given to no more than one of the friends (or you can even keep it for yourself). 
tl;dr: You are given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You should find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex covers or claim it's impossible. 

Chef and Chefina are best friends. Chefina wants to test the Problem Solving skills of chef so she provides Chef 2 integer number  $X$ and $Y$ The task of chef is to take the  two numbers $X$ and $Y$ and return their SUM. Identify whether Chef can solve the problem or not   
tl;dr: Print the sum of the given two numbers $X$ and $Y$. 

For integers b (b \geq 2) and n (n \geq 1), let the function f(b,n) be defined as follows:  - f(b,n) = n, when n < b  - f(b,n) = f(b,\,{\rm floor}(n / b)) + (n \ {\rm mod} \ b), when n \geq b Here, {\rm floor}(n / b) denotes the largest integer not exceeding n / b, and n \ {\rm mod} \ b denotes the remainder of n divided by b. Less formally, f(b,n) is equal to the sum of the digits of n written in base b. For example, the following hold:  - f(10,\,87654)=8+7+6+5+4=30  - f(100,\,87654)=8+76+54=138 You are given integers n and s. Determine if there exists an integer b (b \geq 2) such that f(b,n)=s. If the answer is positive, also find the smallest such b. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq n \leq 10^{11}  - 1 \leq s \leq 10^{11}  - n,\,s are integers.
