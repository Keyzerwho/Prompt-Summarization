We have three stones at points (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) on a two-dimensional plane. These three stones are said to form an L when they satisfy the following conditions:  - Each of the stones is at integer coordinates.  - Each of the stones is adjacent to another stone. (That is, for each stone, there is another stone whose distance from that stone is 1.)  - The three stones do not lie on the same line. Particularly, the initial arrangement of the stone - (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) - forms an L. You can do the following operation any number of times: choose one of the stones and move it to any position. However, after each operation, the stones must form an L. You want to do as few operations as possible to put stones at points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy). How many operations do you need to do this  It is guaranteed that the desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L. Under this condition, it is always possible to achieve the objective with a finite number of operations. You will be given T cases of this problem. Solve each of them. -----Notes----- We assume that the three stones are indistinguishable. For example, the stone that is initially at point (0,0) may be at any of the points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) in the end. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq T \leq 10^3  - |ax|,|ay|,|bx|,|by|,|cx|,|cy| \leq 10^9  - The desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L.

Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division. To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with $t$ pairs of integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer $x_i$, such that:   $p_i$ is divisible by $x_i$;  $x_i$ is not divisible by $q_i$.  Oleg is really good at division and managed to find all the answers quickly, how about you

Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path. You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.

Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro. Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack. Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:  Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before.  If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then:   If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)     (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength).  If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  >  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage.   Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.
