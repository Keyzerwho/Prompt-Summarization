# Task  Your Informatics teacher at school likes coming up with new ways to help you understand the material. When you started studying numeral systems, he introduced his own numeral system, which he's convinced will help clarify things. His numeral system has base 26, and its digits are represented by English capital letters - `A for 0, B for 1, and so on`.  The teacher assigned you the following numeral system exercise: given a one-digit `number`, you should find all unordered pairs of one-digit numbers whose values add up to the `number`. # 
tl;dr: Given a one-digit number, you should find all unordered pairs of one-digit numbers whose values add up to the number. 

Implement a function which takes a string, and returns its hash value. Algorithm steps: * `a` := sum of the ascii values of the input characters * `b` := sum of every difference between the consecutive characters of the input (second char minus first char, third minus second, ...) * `c` := (`a` OR `b`) AND ((NOT `a`) shift left by 2 bits) * `d` := `c` XOR (32 * (`total_number_of_spaces` + 1)) * return `d` **Note**: OR, AND, NOT, XOR are bitwise operations. ___ ###

Fox Ciel is playing a card game with her friend Jiro. Jiro has n cards, each one has two attributes: position (Attack or Defense) and strength. Fox Ciel has m cards, each one has these two attributes too. It's known that position of all Ciel's cards is Attack. Now is Ciel's battle phase, Ciel can do the following operation many times:  Choose one of her cards X. This card mustn't be chosen before.  If Jiro has no alive cards at that moment, he gets the damage equal to (X's strength). Otherwise, Ciel needs to choose one Jiro's alive card Y, then:   If Y's position is Attack, then (X's strength)     (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, and Jiro gets the damage equal to (X's strength) - (Y's strength).  If Y's position is Defense, then (X's strength)  >  (Y's strength) must hold. After this attack, card Y dies, but Jiro gets no damage.   Ciel can end her battle phase at any moment (so, she can use not all her cards). Help the Fox to calculate the maximal sum of damage Jiro can get.
