To compress the string, you have to represent $s$ as a concatenation of several non-empty strings: $s = t_{1} t_{2} \\ldots t_{k}$. The $i$-th of these strings should be encoded with one of the two ways: if $|t_{i}| = 1$, meaning that the current string consists of a single character, you can encode it paying $a$ coins; if $t_{i}$ is a substring of $t_{1} t_{2} \\ldots t_{i - 1}$, then you can encode it paying $b$ coins. A string $x$ is a substring of a string $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. So your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of coins you need to spend in order to compress the given string $s$.",
