            "text": " You are hosting a fancy party for fancy friends. And, like any fancy party, you need to buy some fancy antiques to put up around the venue (your house). There is a set of $n$ fancy antiques that you need to buy. And there is a set of $m$ fancy antique shops in the city. Because these antiques are extremely rare, each fancy antique can only be found at a single fancy antique shop. However, the fancy antique shops can also sell  knock-off  (duplicate) versions of some of the antiques. And of course, for any fancy antique, there is only a single fancy antique shop in the city that holds a knock-off version of that antique (this is to maintain the rareness of the antiques). The shop that sells the original is not always the same shop that holds the knock-off. It turns out that even though you can tell the difference, most people cannot tell the original version from the knock-off version of any given antique. And, because the shops can get away with it, sometimes the knock-off is more expensive than the original! Since the party is tomorrow, you only have time to visit $k$ shops. You would like to buy one version (either the original or the knock-off) of each of the $n$ antiques. Suppose that there are three shops, and three antiques we would like to buy.  - Antique $\\# 1$ sells for $30$ at shop $\\# 1$. Its knockoff sells for $50$ at shop $\\# 2$.  - Antique $\\# 2$ sells for $70$ at shop $\\# 2$. Its knockoff",
