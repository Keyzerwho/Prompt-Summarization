Heidi is a statistician to the core, and she likes to study the evolution of marmot populations in each of V (1   V   100) villages! So it comes that every spring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her barn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome her friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures. Arriving in a village, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of inhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April Fools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of inhabitants P (10   P   1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-negative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:   Poisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{p^{k} e^{-P}}{k !}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,  Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{1}{2 P + 1}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P.  Heidi collects exactly 250 answers per village. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution. Heidi cannot tell marmots apart, so she may query some marmots several times, and each time the marmot will answer with a new number drawn from the village's distribution. Can you help Heidi to find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
tl;dr: The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  

Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed. Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

Andrew was very excited to participate in Olympiad of Metropolises. Days flew by quickly, and Andrew is already at the airport, ready to go home. He has $n$ rubles left, and would like to exchange them to euro and dollar bills. Andrew can mix dollar bills and euro bills in whatever way he wants. The price of one dollar is $d$ rubles, and one euro costs $e$ rubles. Recall that there exist the following dollar bills: $1$, $2$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $50$, $100$, and the following euro bills   $5$, $10$, $20$, $50$, $100$, $200$ (note that, in this problem we do not consider the $500$ euro bill, it is hard to find such bills in the currency exchange points). Andrew can buy any combination of bills, and his goal is to minimize the total number of rubles he will have after the exchange. Help him   write a program that given integers $n$, $e$ and $d$, finds the minimum number of rubles Andrew can get after buying dollar and euro bills.
