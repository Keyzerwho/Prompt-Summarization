Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, namely, Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If the sum of Rs. N is input, write a program to computer smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N. 
tl;dr: You are given sum of Rs. N as input, Find smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N if there are denominations notes of Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. 

Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed. Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

Andrew was very excited to participate in Olympiad of Metropolises. Days flew by quickly, and Andrew is already at the airport, ready to go home. He has $n$ rubles left, and would like to exchange them to euro and dollar bills. Andrew can mix dollar bills and euro bills in whatever way he wants. The price of one dollar is $d$ rubles, and one euro costs $e$ rubles. Recall that there exist the following dollar bills: $1$, $2$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $50$, $100$, and the following euro bills   $5$, $10$, $20$, $50$, $100$, $200$ (note that, in this problem we do not consider the $500$ euro bill, it is hard to find such bills in the currency exchange points). Andrew can buy any combination of bills, and his goal is to minimize the total number of rubles he will have after the exchange. Help him   write a program that given integers $n$, $e$ and $d$, finds the minimum number of rubles Andrew can get after buying dollar and euro bills.
