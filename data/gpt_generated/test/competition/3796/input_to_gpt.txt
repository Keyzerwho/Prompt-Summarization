The chef won a duet singing award at Techsurge & Mridang 2012. From that time he is obsessed with the number 2. He just started calculating the powers of two. And adding the digits of the results. But he got puzzled after a few calculations. So gave you the job to generate the solutions to 2^n and find their sum of digits. 
tl;dr: Obtain the solutions to 2^n for a given n and display their sum of digits. 

You are given integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied: For every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $2n$ numbers differ not more than by $1$. For example, choose $n = 3$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, $4 + 5 + 2 = 11$, $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$, $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$, $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$, $6 + 1 + 4 = 11$, any two numbers differ by at most $1$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $5 + 1 + 6 = 12$, and $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$, $9$ and $12$ differ more than by $1$.  [Image]

You are given $n$ integers. You need to choose a subset and put the chosen numbers in a beautiful rectangle (rectangular matrix). Each chosen number should occupy one of its rectangle cells, each cell must be filled with exactly one chosen number. Some of the $n$ numbers may not be chosen. A rectangle (rectangular matrix) is called beautiful if in each row and in each column all values are different. What is the largest (by the total number of cells) beautiful rectangle you can construct  Print the rectangle itself.
