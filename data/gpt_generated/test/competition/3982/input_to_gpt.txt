Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem. You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once  Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a b c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a bbc" and "babbc". Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring. Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

Complete the solution so that it returns the number of times the search_text is found within the full_text. ```python search_substr( fullText, searchText, allowOverlap = true ) ``` so that overlapping solutions are (not) counted. If the searchText is empty, it should return `0`. Usage examples: ```python search_substr('aa_bb_cc_dd_bb_e', 'bb') # should return 2 since bb shows up twice search_substr('aaabbbcccc', 'bbb') # should return 1 search_substr( 'aaa', 'aa' ) # should return 2 search_substr( 'aaa', '' ) # should return 0 search_substr( 'aaa', 'aa', false ) # should return 1 ``
tl;dr: Write a function search_substr(fullText, searchText) that it returns the number of times the search_text is found within the full_text. If the searchText is empty, return 0. 

In Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $1$ to $4$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a "0" and a dash with a "1". Because there are $2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$ strings with length $1$ to $4$ containing only "0" and/or "1", not all of them correspond to one of the $26$ English letters. In particular, each string of "0" and/or "1" of length at most $4$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: "0011", "0101", "1110", and "1111". You will work with a string $S$, which is initially empty. For $m$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $S$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $S$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $S$ in Morse code. Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $10^9 + 7$.
