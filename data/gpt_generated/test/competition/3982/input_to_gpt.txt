Sasha likes programming. Once, during a very long contest, Sasha decided that he was a bit tired and needed to relax. So he did. But since Sasha isn't an ordinary guy, he prefers to relax unusually. During leisure time Sasha likes to upsolve unsolved problems because upsolving is very useful. Therefore, Sasha decided to upsolve the following problem: You have an array $a$ with $n$ integers. You need to count the number of funny pairs $(l, r)$ $(l \leq r)$. To check if a pair $(l, r)$ is a funny pair, take $mid = \frac{l + r - 1}{2}$, then if $r - l + 1$ is an even number and $a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{mid} = a_{mid + 1} \oplus a_{mid + 2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r$, then the pair is funny. In other words, $\oplus$ of elements of the left half of the subarray from $l$ to $r$ should be equal to $\oplus$ of elements of the right half. Note that $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. It is time to continue solving the contest, so Sasha asked you to solve this task.

Task: Make a function that converts a word to pig latin. The rules of pig latin are: ``` If the word has more than 3 letters:   1. Take the first letter of a word and move it to the end   2. Add -ay to the word Otherwise leave the word alone. ```

The chef was searching for his pen in the garage but he found his old machine with a display and some numbers on it. If some numbers entered then some different output occurs on the display. Chef wants to crack the algorithm that the machine is following. 
tl;dr: Write a code to print the average of the multiplication of a given number N with N-1 integer.                                    1 

In Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $1$ to $4$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a "0" and a dash with a "1". Because there are $2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$ strings with length $1$ to $4$ containing only "0" and/or "1", not all of them correspond to one of the $26$ English letters. In particular, each string of "0" and/or "1" of length at most $4$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: "0011", "0101", "1110", and "1111". You will work with a string $S$, which is initially empty. For $m$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $S$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $S$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $S$ in Morse code. Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $10^9 + 7$.
