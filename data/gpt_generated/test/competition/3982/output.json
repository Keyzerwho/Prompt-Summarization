            "text": " In Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $1$ to $4$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\". Because there are $2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$ strings with length $1$ to $4$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $26$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $4$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". You will work with a string $S$, which is initially empty. For $m$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $S$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $S$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $S$ in Morse code. Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $10^9 + 7$. ",
