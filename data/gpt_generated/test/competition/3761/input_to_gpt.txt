You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide. We will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good. The angle between vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\operatorname{arccos}(\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\vec{y}|})$, where $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\vec{x}|= \sqrt{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is length of $\vec{x}$. Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.

=====Problem Statement===== ABCXYZ company has up to 100 employees. The company decides to create a unique identification number (UID) for each of its employees. The company has assigned you the task of validating all the randomly generated UIDs. A valid UID must follow the rules below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits (0-9). It should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z & 0-9). No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid UID. 
tl;dr: =====Problem Statement===== You are given a string A valid string must follow the conditions below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits 0 to 9. It should only contain alphanumeric characters a-z, A-Z & 0-9. No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid string. 

A robot is put at the origin in a two-dimensional plane. Initially, the robot is facing in the positive x-axis direction. This robot will be given an instruction sequence s. s consists of the following two kinds of letters, and will be executed in order from front to back.  - F : Move in the current direction by distance 1.  - T : Turn 90 degrees, either clockwise or counterclockwise. The objective of the robot is to be at coordinates (x, y) after all the instructions are executed. Determine whether this objective is achievable. -----Constraints-----  - s consists of F and T.  - 1 \leq |s| \leq 8 000  - x and y are integers.  - |x|, |y| \leq |s|
