This robot will be given an instruction sequence s. s consists of the following two kinds of letters, and will be executed in order from front to back. - F : Move in the current direction by distance 1. - T : Turn 90 degrees, either clockwise or counterclockwise. The objective of the robot is to be at coordinates (x, y) after all the instructions are executed. Determine whether this objective is achievable. -----Constraints----- - s consists of F and T. - 1 \\leq |s| \\leq 8 000 - x and y are integers. - |x|, |y| \\leq |s|",
