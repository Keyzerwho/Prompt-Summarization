Complete the function that determines the score of a hand in the card game [Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) (aka 21). The function receives an array of strings that represent each card in the hand (`"2"`, `"3",` ..., `"10"`, `"J"`, `"Q"`, `"K"` or `"A"`) and should return the score of the hand (integer). ~~~if:c 
tl;dr: Complete the function that determines the score of a hand in the card game Blackjack and return the highest score of the cards that is less than or equal to 21. If there is no score less than or equal to 21 return the smallest score more than 21. Number cards count as their face value. Jack, Queen and King count as 10. An Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11. 

On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations: Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or; Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display. Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X. Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.   
tl;dr: You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   

Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.  Program is very simple, Given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers. 
tl;dr: Write a program to add given two integers A and B. 

There is a string S of length N consisting of characters 0 and 1. You will perform the following operation for each i = 1, 2, ..., m:  - Arbitrarily permute the characters within the substring of S starting at the l_i-th character from the left and extending through the r_i-th character. Here, the sequence l_i is non-decreasing. How many values are possible for S after the M operations, modulo 1000000007(= 10^9+7)  -----Constraints-----  - 2 N 3000  - 1 M 3000  - S consists of characters 0 and 1.  - The length of S equals N.  - 1 l_i < r_i N  - l_i   l_{i+1}
