He put the cube into three-dimensional space in such a way that its vertices lay at integer points (it is possible that the cube's sides are not parallel to the coordinate axes). Then he took a piece of paper and wrote down eight lines, each containing three integers \ncoordinates of cube's vertex (a single line contains coordinates of a single vertex, each vertex is written exactly once), put the paper on the table and left. While Peter was away, his little brother Nick decided to play with the numbers on the paper. In one operation Nick could swap some numbers inside a single line (Nick didn't swap numbers from distinct lines). Nick could have performed any number of such operations. When Peter returned and found out about Nick's mischief, he started recollecting the original coordinates. Help Peter restore the original position of the points or else state that this is impossible and the numbers were initially recorded incorrectly.",
