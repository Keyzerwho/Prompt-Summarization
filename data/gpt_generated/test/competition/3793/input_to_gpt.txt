Karlsson has recently discovered a huge stock of berry jam jars in the basement of the house. More specifically, there were $2n$ jars of strawberry and blueberry jam. All the $2n$ jars are arranged in a row. The stairs to the basement are exactly in the middle of that row. So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly $n$ jars to his left and $n$ jars to his right. For example, the basement might look like this: [Image]  Being the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right. Finally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.  Jars are numbered from $1$ to $2n$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $n$ and $n+1$. What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left  Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: There were $2n$ values of A and B arranged in a list. You should start at the middle of the list. $n$ values to the left and $n$ values to the right. You can choose to make a value zero from either the first non-zero value to left or the first non-zero value to right. Finally, at the end the number of A's and B's should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.

Baby is getting his frst tooth. This means more sleepless nights, but with the fun of feeling round his gums and trying to guess which will be first out!  Probably best have a sweepstake with your friends - because you have the best chance of knowing. You can feel the gums and see where the raised bits are - most raised, most likely tooth to come through first! Given an array of numbers (t) to represent baby's gums, you need to return the index of the lump that is most pronounced.  The most pronounced lump is the one that has the biggest differential to its surrounding values. e.g.: ``` [1, 2, 4] = 2 index 0 has a differential of -1 to its right (it is lower so the figure is negative) index 1 has a differential of +1 to its left, and -2 to its right. Total is -1. index 2 has a differential of +2 to its left, and nothing to its right,  ``` If there is no distinct highest value (more than one occurence of the largest differential), return -1

Chef wants you to distribute candies among $N$ kids who are sitting in a circle. However, he wants to make some kids jealous of others. Thus, he wants you to distribute candies in such a way that there is a difference of at least $K$ candies between two adjacent kids.  Given the value of $N$ and $K$, you need to find the minimum number of candies you need to satisfy the given conditions, such that, each kid gets at least one candy. 
tl;dr: You are given $N$ nodes arranged in a cycle initialised to zero and a difference $K$.  Find and return the minimum number of increments required so that each node is atleast $1$ and adjacent nodes have a difference of is atleast $K$. 

Peter had a cube with non-zero length of a side. He put the cube into three-dimensional space in such a way that its vertices lay at integer points (it is possible that the cube's sides are not parallel to the coordinate axes). Then he took a piece of paper and wrote down eight lines, each containing three integers   coordinates of cube's vertex (a single line contains coordinates of a single vertex, each vertex is written exactly once), put the paper on the table and left. While Peter was away, his little brother Nick decided to play with the numbers on the paper. In one operation Nick could swap some numbers inside a single line (Nick didn't swap numbers from distinct lines). Nick could have performed any number of such operations. When Peter returned and found out about Nick's mischief, he started recollecting the original coordinates. Help Peter restore the original position of the points or else state that this is impossible and the numbers were initially recorded incorrectly.
