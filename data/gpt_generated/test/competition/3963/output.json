Conveniently, the denomination of the coin type k divides the denomination of the coin type k + 1, the denomination of the coin type 1 equals 1 tugrick. The ratio of the denominations of coin types k + 1 and k equals a_{k}. It is known that for each x there are at most 20 coin types of denomination x. Byteasar has b_{k} coins of type k with him, and he needs to pay exactly m tugricks. It is known that Byteasar never has more than 3 10^5 coins with him. Byteasar want to know how many ways there are to pay exactly m tugricks. Two ways are different if there is an integer k such that the amount of coins of type k differs in these two ways. As all Byteland citizens, Byteasar wants to know the number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7. ",
