Write a function that gets a sequence and value and returns `true/false` depending on whether the variable exists in a multidimentional sequence. 
tl;dr: Write a function that gets a sequence and value and returns `true` if the variable exists in a multidimentional sequence. 

A tree is a graph with n vertices and exactly n - 1 edges; this graph should meet the following condition: there exists exactly one shortest (by number of edges) path between any pair of its vertices. A subtree of a tree T is a tree with both vertices and edges as subsets of vertices and edges of T. You're given a tree with n vertices. Consider its vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. Additionally an integer is written on every vertex of this tree. Initially the integer written on the i-th vertex is equal to v_{i}. In one move you can apply the following operation:  Select the subtree of the given tree that includes the vertex with number 1.  Increase (or decrease) by one all the integers which are written on the vertices of that subtree.  Calculate the minimum number of moves that is required to make all the integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero.

There are n types of coins in Byteland. Conveniently, the denomination of the coin type k divides the denomination of the coin type k + 1, the denomination of the coin type 1 equals 1 tugrick. The ratio of the denominations of coin types k + 1 and k equals a_{k}. It is known that for each x there are at most 20 coin types of denomination x. Byteasar has b_{k} coins of type k with him, and he needs to pay exactly m tugricks. It is known that Byteasar never has more than 3 10^5 coins with him. Byteasar want to know how many ways there are to pay exactly m tugricks. Two ways are different if there is an integer k such that the amount of coins of type k differs in these two ways. As all Byteland citizens, Byteasar wants to know the number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7.
