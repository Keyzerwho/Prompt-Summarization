Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 3. If any of the permutations is divisible by 3 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: Check whether the given number N is divisible by 3 or not. If yes then print 1 else print 0. 

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls $x = 0$). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices $0 \leq i < m$, such that $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \right\rfloor$ is odd. Tell her the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$.

You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number. Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.  Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order. 
tl;dr: You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number in a pair. A chain if formed when a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Find the length of longest chain which can be formed.  

You are given a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. You need to paint elements in colors, so that:   If we consider any color, all elements of this color must be divisible by the minimal element of this color.  The number of used colors must be minimized.  For example, it's fine to paint elements $[40, 10, 60]$ in a single color, because they are all divisible by $10$. You can use any color an arbitrary amount of times (in particular, it is allowed to use a color only once). The elements painted in one color do not need to be consecutive. For example, if $a=[6, 2, 3, 4, 12]$ then two colors are required: let's paint $6$, $3$ and $12$ in the first color ($6$, $3$ and $12$ are divisible by $3$) and paint $2$ and $4$ in the second color ($2$ and $4$ are divisible by $2$). For example, if $a=[10, 7, 15]$ then $3$ colors are required (we can simply paint each element in an unique color).
