# Task Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence. Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.  ## Input * sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.  For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`)

A transaction is possibly invalid if: the amount exceeds $1000, or; if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city. Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction. Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.   
tl;dr: You are given a list of strings where each string in format of "A,B,C,D". where A,D are strings and B,C are numbers. A string is possibly invalid if: the C exceeds 1000, or; if two strings have same A and different D and the difference between C is greater than or equal to 60. return list of strings which are possibley invalid in any order 

Bohan loves milk tea so much and he drinks one cup of milk tea every day. The local shop sells milk tea in two sizes: a Medium cup for $3 and a Large cup for $4. For every cup of milk tea purchased Bohan receives a promotional stamp. Bohan may redeem 6 stamps for a free drink of milk tea regardless of the size. No stamp will be given for a free drink. Determine the amount of money Bohan have spent on milk tea, given a sequence of milk tea sizes he got in the past a few days. Assume Bohan had no stamps in the beginning and he always redeemed the stamps for the next drink once he had collected 6 stamps. 
tl;dr: You are given a medium item for $3 and a large item for $4. A promotional free coupon is given for every purchase and six coupon are required for one free item. No coupon for free item. Determine the amount of money you for the given past sequence of item.You do not have any stamp in beginning and spent free stamp just after the purchase of six items. 

Recently, Tokitsukaze found an interesting game. Tokitsukaze had $n$ items at the beginning of this game. However, she thought there were too many items, so now she wants to discard $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) special items of them. These $n$ items are marked with indices from $1$ to $n$. In the beginning, the item with index $i$ is placed on the $i$-th position. Items are divided into several pages orderly, such that each page contains exactly $k$ positions and the last positions on the last page may be left empty. Tokitsukaze would do the following operation: focus on the first special page that contains at least one special item, and at one time, Tokitsukaze would discard all special items on this page. After an item is discarded or moved, its old position would be empty, and then the item below it, if exists, would move up to this empty position. The movement may bring many items forward and even into previous pages, so Tokitsukaze would keep waiting until all the items stop moving, and then do the operation (i.e. check the special page and discard the special items) repeatedly until there is no item need to be discarded.  [Image] Consider the first example from the statement: $n=10$, $m=4$, $k=5$, $p=[3, 5, 7, 10]$. The are two pages. Initially, the first page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). So Tokitsukaze discards the special items with indices $3$ and $5$. After, the first page remains to be special. It contains $[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]$, Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index $7$. After, the second page is special (since it is the first page containing a special item). It contains $[9, 10]$, Tokitsukaze discards the special item with index $10$.  Tokitsukaze wants to know the number of operations she would do in total.
