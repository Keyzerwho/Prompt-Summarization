However, she thought there were too many items, so now she wants to discard $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le n$) special items of them. These $n$ items are marked with indices from $1$ to $n$. In the beginning, the item with index $i$ is placed on the $i$-th position. Items are divided into several pages orderly, such that each page contains exactly $k$ positions and the last positions on the last page may be left empty. Tokitsukaze would do the following operation: focus on the first special page that contains at least one special item, and at one time, Tokitsukaze would discard all special items on this page. After an item is discarded or moved, its old position would be empty, and then the item below it, if exists, would move up to this empty position. The movement may bring many items forward and even into previous pages, so Tokitsukaze would keep waiting until all the items stop moving, and then do the operation (i.e. check the special page and discard the special items) repeatedly until there is no item need to be discarded.
