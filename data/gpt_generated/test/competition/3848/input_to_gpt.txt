Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

Write a program, which takes an integer N and if the number is less than 10 then display "Thanks for helping Chef!" otherwise print "-1".

A simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1 
tl;dr: You have find out the frequency of letters in a given string and print it as the new string which comprises of the letter followed by its frequency.For example string is- abcdabf. Then the new string is- a2b2c1d1f1 

Paul hates palindromes. He assumes that string s is tolerable if each its character is one of the first p letters of the English alphabet and s doesn't contain any palindrome contiguous substring of length 2 or more. Paul has found a tolerable string s of length n. Help him find the lexicographically next tolerable string of the same length or else state that such string does not exist. 
tl;dr:
