A subsequence of a string S is a string that can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from S without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, arc, artistic and (an empty string) are all subsequences of artistic; abc and ci are not. You are given a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Find the shortest string among the strings consisting of lowercase English letters that are not subsequences of A. If there are more than one such string, find the lexicographically smallest one among them. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |A| \leq 2 \times 10^5  - A consists of lowercase English letters.

Write a function named sumDigits which takes a number as input and returns the sum of the absolute value of each of the number's decimal digits.  For example: ```python   sum_digits(10)  # Returns 1   sum_digits(99)  # Returns 18   sum_digits(-32) # Returns 5 ``` Let's assume that all numbers in the input will be integer values

Given is an integer sequence of length N: A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N. An integer sequence X, which is also of length N, will be chosen randomly by independently choosing X_i from a uniform distribution on the integers 1, 2, \ldots, A_i for each i (1 \leq i \leq N). Compute the expected value of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence X, modulo 1000000007. More formally, under the constraints of the problem, we can prove that the expected value can be represented as a rational number, that is, an irreducible fraction \frac{P}{Q}, and there uniquely exists an integer R such that R \times Q \equiv P \pmod {1000000007} and 0 \leq R < 1000000007, so print this integer R. -----Notes----- A subsequence of a sequence X is a sequence obtained by extracting some of the elements of X and arrange them without changing the order. The longest increasing subsequence of a sequence X is the sequence of the greatest length among the strictly increasing subsequences of X. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 6  - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9  - All values in input are integers.
