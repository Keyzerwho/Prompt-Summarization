An integer sequence X, which is also of length N, will be chosen randomly by independently choosing X_i from a uniform distribution on the integers 1, 2, \\ldots, A_i for each i (1 \\leq i \\leq N). Compute the expected value of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence X, modulo 1000000007. More formally, under the constraints of the problem, we can prove that the expected value can be represented as a rational number, that is, an irreducible fraction \\frac{P}{Q}, and there uniquely exists an integer R such that R \\times Q \\equiv P \\pmod {1000000007} and 0 \\leq R < 1000000007, so print this integer R. -----Notes----- A subsequence of a sequence X is a sequence obtained by extracting some of the elements of X and arrange them without changing the order. The longest increasing subsequence of a sequence X is the sequence of the greatest length among the strictly increasing subsequences of X. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \\leq N \\leq 6  - 1 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9  - All values in input are integers.",
