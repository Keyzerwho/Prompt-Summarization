Chef owns an icecream shop in Chefland named scoORZ. There are only three types of coins in Chefland: Rs. 5, Rs. 10 and Rs. 15. An icecream costs Rs. 5. There are $N$ people (numbered $1$ through $N$) standing in a queue to buy icecream from scoORZ. Each person wants to buy exactly one icecream. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th person has one coin with value $a_i$. It is only possible for someone to buy an icecream when Chef can give them back their change exactly   for example, if someone pays with a Rs. 10 coin, Chef needs to have a Rs. 5 coin that he gives to this person as change. Initially, Chef has no money. He wants to know if he can sell icecream to everyone in the queue, in the given order. Since he is busy eating his own icecream, can you tell him if he can serve all these people  
tl;dr: Only coin of Rs 5 ,Rs 10 and Rs 15 can be used to buy icecream which costs 5 Rs. In beginning, shopkeeper does not have any money. Icecream can be sold only if shopkeeper can return the change exactly. Check whether the shopkeeper can sell the icecream or not. 

Sandu, a teacher in Chefland introduced his students to a new sequence i.e. 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,4........ The Sequence starts from 0 and increases by one till $i$(initially i equals to 1), then repeat itself with $i$ changed to $i+1$ Students being curious about the sequence asks the Nth element of the sequence. Help Sandu to answer the Students 
tl;dr: 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,4........ The sequence starts from 0 and increases by one till $i$(initially i equals to 1), then repeat itself with $i$ changed to $i+1$. Find the Nth term of the sequence. 

Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} for his birthday. Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a pair of indexes i, j (1   i < j   n), such that an inequality a_{i} > a_{j} holds. Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get. 
tl;dr: You are given a sequence. You can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. You want the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Find the minimum number of inversions you can get. 

Panic is rising in the committee for doggo standardization   the puppies of the new brood have been born multi-colored! In total there are 26 possible colors of puppies in the nature and they are denoted by letters from 'a' to 'z' inclusive. The committee rules strictly prohibit even the smallest diversity between doggos and hence all the puppies should be of the same color. Thus Slava, the committee employee, has been assigned the task to recolor some puppies into other colors in order to eliminate the difference and make all the puppies have one common color. Unfortunately, due to bureaucratic reasons and restricted budget, there's only one operation Slava can perform: he can choose a color $x$ such that there are currently at least two puppies of color $x$ and recolor all puppies of the color $x$ into some arbitrary color $y$. Luckily, this operation can be applied multiple times (including zero). For example, if the number of puppies is $7$ and their colors are represented as the string "abababc", then in one operation Slava can get the results "zbzbzbc", "bbbbbbc", "aaaaaac", "acacacc" and others. However, if the current color sequence is "abababc", then he can't choose $x$='c' right now, because currently only one puppy has the color 'c'. Help Slava and the committee determine whether it is possible to standardize all the puppies, i.e. after Slava's operations all the puppies should have the same color.
