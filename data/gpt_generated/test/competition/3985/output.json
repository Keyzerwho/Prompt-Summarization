Each good pair (i_{k}, j_{k}) meets the following conditions: i_{k} + j_{k} is an odd number and 1   i_{k} < j_{k}   n. In one operation you can perform a sequence of actions:   take one of the good pairs (i_{k}, j_{k}) and some integer v (v > 1), which divides both numbers a[i_{k}] and a[j_{k}];  divide both numbers by v, i. e. perform the assignments: $a [ i_{k} ] = \\frac{a [ i_{k} ]}{v}$ and $a [ j_{k} ] = \\frac{a [ j_{k} ]}{v}$.  Determine the maximum number of operations you can sequentially perform on the given array. Note that one pair may be used several times in the described operations. ",
