 Find the longest common subsequence of two strings, such that it doesn't contain virus as a substring. 
-----Input----- The input contains three strings in three separate lines: s_1, s_2 and virus (1 ≤ |s_1|, |s_2|, |virus| ≤ 100). Each string consists only of uppercase English letters. -----Output----- Output the longest common subsequence of s_1 and s_2 without virus as a substring. If there are multiple answers, any of them will be accepted.  If there is no valid common subsequence, output 0. -----Examples----- Input AJKEQSLOBSROFGZ OVGURWZLWVLUXTH OZ Output ORZ Input AA A A Output 0
