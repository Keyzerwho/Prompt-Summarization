Implement a function which  creates a **[radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)** (a space-optimized trie [prefix tree])  in which each node that is the only child is merged with its parent [unless a word from the input ends there])  from a given list of words  using dictionaries (aka hash maps or hash tables) where: 1. The dictionary keys are the nodes. 2. Leaf nodes are empty dictionaries. 3. The value for empty input is an empty dictionary. 4. Words are all lowercase or empty strings. 5. Words can contain duplicates. ###

## A square of squares You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks! However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain  Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a _perfect square_. ## Task Given an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number): > In mathematics, a __square number__ or __perfect square__ is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. The tests will _always_ use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages. ### 
tl;dr: Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number. 

Sandu, a teacher in Chefland introduced his students to a new sequence i.e. 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,4........ The Sequence starts from 0 and increases by one till $i$(initially i equals to 1), then repeat itself with $i$ changed to $i+1$ Students being curious about the sequence asks the Nth element of the sequence. Help Sandu to answer the Students 
tl;dr: 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,4........ The sequence starts from 0 and increases by one till $i$(initially i equals to 1), then repeat itself with $i$ changed to $i+1$. Find the Nth term of the sequence. 

In mathematics, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence BDF is a subsequence of ABCDEF. A substring of a string is a continuous subsequence of the string. For example, BCD is a substring of ABCDEF. You are given two strings s_1, s_2 and another string called virus. Your task is to find the longest common subsequence of s_1 and s_2, such that it doesn't contain virus as a substring.
