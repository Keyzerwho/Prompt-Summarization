Task: Make a function that converts a word to pig latin. The rules of pig latin are: ``` If the word has more than 3 letters:   1. Take the first letter of a word and move it to the end   2. Add -ay to the word Otherwise leave the word alone. ```

----- ARRAY AND DISTINCT ELEMENTS ----- Chef is multitalented but he mistakenly took part in 2 contest which will take place at the same time. So while chef is busy at one cooking contest, he wants you to take part in coding contest. Chef wants u to solve this program for him. 	 You have been given an array of size n. You have to calculate a subarray of size k with maximum sum having distinct elements same as original array.

AtCoDeer the deer has N square tiles. The tiles are numbered 1 through N, and the number given to each tile is written on one side of the tile. Also, each corner of each tile is painted in one of the 1000 colors, which are represented by the integers 0 between 999. The top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left corner of the tile with the number i are painted in color C_{i,0}, C_{i,1}, C_{i,2} and C_{i,3}, respectively, when seen in the direction of the number written on the tile (See Figure 1). Figure 1: The correspondence between the colors of a tile and the input AtCoDeer is constructing a cube using six of these tiles, under the following conditions:  - For each tile, the side with the number must face outward.  - For each vertex of the cube, the three corners of the tiles that forms it must all be painted in the same color. Help him by finding the number of the different cubes that can be constructed under the conditions. Since each tile has a number written on it, two cubes are considered different if the set of the used tiles are different, or the tiles are used in different directions, even if the formation of the colors are the same. (Each tile can be used in one of the four directions, obtained by 90  rotations.) Two cubes are considered the same only if rotating one in the three dimensional space can obtain an exact copy of the other, including the directions of the tiles.
