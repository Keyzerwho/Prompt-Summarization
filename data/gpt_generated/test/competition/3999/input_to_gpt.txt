Bessie has way too many friends because she is everyone's favorite cow! Her new friend Rabbit is trying to hop over so they can play!  More specifically, he wants to get from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ by making multiple hops. He is only willing to hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its $n$ favorite numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. What is the minimum number of hops Rabbit needs to get from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$  Rabbit may land on points with non-integer coordinates. It can be proved that Rabbit can always reach his destination. Recall that the Euclidean distance between points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ is $\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}$. For example, if Rabbit has favorite numbers $1$ and $3$ he could hop from $(0,0)$ to $(4,0)$ in two hops as shown below. Note that there also exists other valid ways to hop to $(4,0)$ in $2$ hops (e.g. $(0,0)$ $\rightarrow$ $(2,-\sqrt{5})$ $\rightarrow$ $(4,0)$).  $1$ Here is a graphic for the first example. Both hops have distance $3$, one of Rabbit's favorite numbers.  In other words, each time Rabbit chooses some number $a_i$ and hops with distance equal to $a_i$ in any direction he wants. The same number can be used multiple times. 
tl;dr: you wants to get from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$ by making multiple hops. you can only hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of its $n$ favorite numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. What is the minimum number of hops you need to move from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$  you may land on points with non-integer coordinates. It can be proved that you can always reach his destination. Recall that the Euclidean distance between points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ is $\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}$. For example, if you have favorite numbers $1$ and $3$ he could hop from $(0,0)$ to $(4,0)$ in two hops as shown below. Note that there also exists other valid ways to hop to $(4,0)$ in $2$ hops (e.g. $(0,0)$ $\rightarrow$ $(2,-\sqrt{5})$ $\rightarrow$ $(4,0)$).  $1$ Here is a graphic for the first example. Both hops have distance $3$, one of your favorite numbers.  In other words, each time you chooses some number $a_i$ and hops with distance equal to $a_i$ in any direction he wants. The same number can be used multiple times. 

I'm sure you're familiar with factorials   that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.  For example, `5! = 120`, as `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120` Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives `120`, it should return `"5!"` (as a string). Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return `"None"` (as a string). ### 
tl;dr: Create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. If the number is not a factorial of another, returns "None".  

AtCoDeer the deer has N square tiles. The tiles are numbered 1 through N, and the number given to each tile is written on one side of the tile. Also, each corner of each tile is painted in one of the 1000 colors, which are represented by the integers 0 between 999. The top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left corner of the tile with the number i are painted in color C_{i,0}, C_{i,1}, C_{i,2} and C_{i,3}, respectively, when seen in the direction of the number written on the tile (See Figure 1). Figure 1: The correspondence between the colors of a tile and the input AtCoDeer is constructing a cube using six of these tiles, under the following conditions:  - For each tile, the side with the number must face outward.  - For each vertex of the cube, the three corners of the tiles that forms it must all be painted in the same color. Help him by finding the number of the different cubes that can be constructed under the conditions. Since each tile has a number written on it, two cubes are considered different if the set of the used tiles are different, or the tiles are used in different directions, even if the formation of the colors are the same. (Each tile can be used in one of the four directions, obtained by 90  rotations.) Two cubes are considered the same only if rotating one in the three dimensional space can obtain an exact copy of the other, including the directions of the tiles.
