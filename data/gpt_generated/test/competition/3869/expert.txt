 Given two rectangles on a plane, find the area of the region that belongs to both of them. 
-----Input----- The first line contains three integers w, h, α (1 ≤ w, h ≤ 10^6; 0 ≤ α ≤ 180). Angle α is given in degrees. -----Output----- In a single line print a real number — the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 45 Output 0.828427125 Input 6 4 30 Output 19.668384925 -----Note----- The second sample has been drawn on the picture above.
