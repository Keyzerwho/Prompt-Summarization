You are given a directed graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. There is a token in vertex $1$. The following actions are allowed:   Token movement. To move the token from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ if there is an edge $u \to v$ in the graph. This action takes $1$ second.  Graph transposition. To transpose all the edges in the graph: replace each edge $u \to v$ by an edge $v \to u$. This action takes increasingly more time: $k$-th transposition takes $2^{k-1}$ seconds, i.e. the first transposition takes $1$ second, the second one takes $2$ seconds, the third one takes $4$ seconds, and so on.  The goal is to move the token from vertex $1$ to vertex $n$ in the shortest possible time. Print this time modulo $998\,244\,353$.

Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him  Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.  
tl;dr: Given a two dimensional metrix of Latin letters, determine if the word "spoon" (case insensitive) appears in the matrix. 

You are given two rectangles on a plane. The centers of both rectangles are located in the origin of coordinates (meaning the center of the rectangle's symmetry). The first rectangle's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes: the length of the side that is parallel to the Ox axis, equals w, the length of the side that is parallel to the Oy axis, equals h. The second rectangle can be obtained by rotating the first rectangle relative to the origin of coordinates by angle  . [Image]  Your task is to find the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles. This region is shaded in the picture.
