The chef is trying to decode some pattern problems, Chef wants your help to code it. Chef has one number K to form a new pattern. Help the chef to code this pattern problem. 
tl;dr: Decode the given pattern and obtain new pattern for a given number K. 

Given a string S. You have to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of S are grouped and groups are space-separated (see sample below)

Toad Rash has a binary string $s$. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones. Let $n$ be the length of $s$. Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $l$, $r$ that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ and there is at least one pair of integers $x$, $k$ such that $1 \leq x, k \leq n$, $l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$, and $s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$. Find this number of pairs for Rash.

You are given two rectangles on a plane. The centers of both rectangles are located in the origin of coordinates (meaning the center of the rectangle's symmetry). The first rectangle's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes: the length of the side that is parallel to the Ox axis, equals w, the length of the side that is parallel to the Oy axis, equals h. The second rectangle can be obtained by rotating the first rectangle relative to the origin of coordinates by angle  . [Image]  Your task is to find the area of the region which belongs to both given rectangles. This region is shaded in the picture.
