# Task  Given a rectangular `matrix` and integers `a` and `b`, consider the union of the ath row and the bth (both 0-based) column of the `matrix`. Return sum of all elements of that union. # 
tl;dr: Given a rectangular matrix and integers a and b, consider the union of the ath row and the bth column of the matrix. Return sum of all elements of that union.

I'm sure you're familiar with factorials   that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.  For example, `5! = 120`, as `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120` Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives `120`, it should return `"5!"` (as a string). Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return `"None"` (as a string). ### 
tl;dr: Create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. If the number is not a factorial of another, returns "None".  

Little C loves number  3  very much. He loves all things about it. Now he is playing a game on a chessboard of size $n \times m$. The cell in the $x$-th row and in the $y$-th column is called $(x,y)$. Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly $3$. The Manhattan distance between two cells $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ is defined as $|x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j|$. He want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard. Please help him find the maximum number of chessmen he can place.
