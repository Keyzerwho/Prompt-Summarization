Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.  Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group. Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way. 
tl;dr: You are given N people to be split into two groups such that given dislikes[i] = [a, b], a and b should be in different groups. You need to return true if such split is possible.

Little C loves number  3  very much. He loves all things about it. Now he is playing a game on a chessboard of size $n \times m$. The cell in the $x$-th row and in the $y$-th column is called $(x,y)$. Initially, The chessboard is empty. Each time, he places two chessmen on two different empty cells, the Manhattan distance between which is exactly $3$. The Manhattan distance between two cells $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_j,y_j)$ is defined as $|x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j|$. He want to place as many chessmen as possible on the chessboard. Please help him find the maximum number of chessmen he can place.
