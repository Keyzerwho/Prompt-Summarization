Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).  Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.  Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane.  Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.   
tl;dr: you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 

Complete the solution so that it takes the object (JavaScript/CoffeeScript) or hash (ruby) passed in and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs.  The format should be "KEY = VALUE". Each key/value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair. **

There is a polyline going through points (0, 0)   (x, x)   (2x, 0)   (3x, x)   (4x, 0)   ... - (2kx, 0)   (2kx + x, x)   ....  We know that the polyline passes through the point (a, b). Find minimum positive value x such that it is true or determine that there is no such x. 
tl;dr:
