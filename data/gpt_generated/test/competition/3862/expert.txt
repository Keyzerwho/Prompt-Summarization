 You are given a list of different types of coke. You want to create a glass of coke with a given concentration. The volume of each type of coke is defined by the concentration of carbon dioxide in the coke. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n, k (0 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6) — carbon dioxide concentration the friends want and the number of Coke types. The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — carbon dioxide concentration of each type of Coke. Some Coke types can have same concentration. -----Output----- Print the minimal natural number of liter needed to prepare a glass with carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{n}{1000}$, or -1 if it is impossible. -----Examples----- Input 400 4 100 300 450 500 Output 2 Input 50 2 100 25 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample case, we can achieve concentration $\frac{400}{1000}$ using one liter of Coke of types $\frac{300}{1000}$ and $\frac{500}{1000}$: $\frac{300 + 500}{1000 + 1000} = \frac{400}{1000}$. In the second case, we can achieve concentration $\frac{50}{1000}$ using two liters of $\frac{25}{1000}$ type and one liter of $\frac{100}{1000}$ type: $\frac{25 + 25 + 100}{3 \cdot 1000} = \frac{50}{1000}$.
