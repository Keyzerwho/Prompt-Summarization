# Story You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee. Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on... But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work. To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in. # Kata Task Given the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted. # 
tl;dr: # Task Given the start and end numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all digits from start number to end number. # 

Polycarp has $n$ different binary words. A word called binary if it contains only characters '0' and '1'. For example, these words are binary: "0001", "11", "0" and "0011100". Polycarp wants to offer his set of $n$ binary words to play a game "words". In this game, players name words and each next word (starting from the second) must start with the last character of the previous word. The first word can be any. For example, these sequence of words can be named during the game: "0101", "1", "10", "00", "00001". Word reversal is the operation of reversing the order of the characters. For example, the word "0111" after the reversal becomes "1110", the word "11010" after the reversal becomes "01011". Probably, Polycarp has such a set of words that there is no way to put them in the order correspondent to the game rules. In this situation, he wants to reverse some words from his set so that:  the final set of $n$ words still contains different words (i.e. all words are unique);  there is a way to put all words of the final set of words in the order so that the final sequence of $n$ words is consistent with the game rules.  Polycarp wants to reverse minimal number of words. Please, help him. 
tl;dr: You are given $n$ different binary words. You want to order the words such that the first character of a word matches the last character of the previous word. If you cannot put the words in that order then you can reverse some words so that: the final set of $n$ words  still contains different words; there is a way to put all words in the order specified.

Sasha and Kolya decided to get drunk with Coke, again. This time they have k types of Coke. i-th type is characterised by its carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{a_{i}}{1000}$. Today, on the party in honour of Sergiy of Vancouver they decided to prepare a glass of Coke with carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{n}{1000}$. The drink should also be tasty, so the glass can contain only integer number of liters of each Coke type (some types can be not presented in the glass). Also, they want to minimize the total volume of Coke in the glass. Carbon dioxide concentration is defined as the volume of carbone dioxide in the Coke divided by the total volume of Coke. When you mix two Cokes, the volume of carbon dioxide sums up, and the total volume of Coke sums up as well. Help them, find the minimal natural number of liters needed to create a glass with carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{n}{1000}$. Assume that the friends have unlimited amount of each Coke type.
