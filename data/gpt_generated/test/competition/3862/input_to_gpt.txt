Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

You are given $n$ arrays that can have different sizes. You also have a table with $w$ columns and $n$ rows. The $i$-th array is placed horizontally in the $i$-th row. You can slide each array within its row as long as it occupies several consecutive cells and lies completely inside the table. You need to find the maximum sum of the integers in the $j$-th column for each $j$ from $1$ to $w$ independently.  [Image] Optimal placements for columns $1$, $2$ and $3$ are shown on the pictures from left to right.  Note that you can exclude any array out of a column provided it remains in the window. In this case its value is considered to be zero.

Sasha and Kolya decided to get drunk with Coke, again. This time they have k types of Coke. i-th type is characterised by its carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{a_{i}}{1000}$. Today, on the party in honour of Sergiy of Vancouver they decided to prepare a glass of Coke with carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{n}{1000}$. The drink should also be tasty, so the glass can contain only integer number of liters of each Coke type (some types can be not presented in the glass). Also, they want to minimize the total volume of Coke in the glass. Carbon dioxide concentration is defined as the volume of carbone dioxide in the Coke divided by the total volume of Coke. When you mix two Cokes, the volume of carbon dioxide sums up, and the total volume of Coke sums up as well. Help them, find the minimal natural number of liters needed to create a glass with carbon dioxide concentration $\frac{n}{1000}$. Assume that the friends have unlimited amount of each Coke type.
