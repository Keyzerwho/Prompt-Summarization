Check if given chord is minor or major. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ There is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music. notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] Note that e. g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1.  
tl;dr: Given a string, determine if given string is minor or major or not a chord. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] 

There are N bags, each containing two white balls. The i-th box contains two balls with integers x_i and y_i written on them, respectively. For each of these bags, you will paint one of the balls red, and paint the other blue. Afterwards, the 2N balls will be classified according to color. Then, we will define the following:  - R_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in red  - R_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in red  - B_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in blue  - B_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in blue Find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) \times (B_{max} - B_{min}). -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   200,000  - 1   x_i, y_i   10^9

Gerald got a very curious hexagon for his birthday. The boy found out that all the angles of the hexagon are equal to $120^{\circ}$. Then he measured the length of its sides, and found that each of them is equal to an integer number of centimeters. There the properties of the hexagon ended and Gerald decided to draw on it. He painted a few lines, parallel to the sides of the hexagon. The lines split the hexagon into regular triangles with sides of 1 centimeter. Now Gerald wonders how many triangles he has got. But there were so many of them that Gerald lost the track of his counting. Help the boy count the triangles.
