 You are given a hexagon with angles equal to 120 degrees. The sides of the hexagon are equal to an integer number of centimeters. You have to draw on it. The lines split the hexagon into regular triangles with sides of 1 centimeter. Find out how many triangles you have got. 
-----Input----- The first and the single line of the input contains 6 space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 and a_6 (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 1000) — the lengths of the sides of the hexagons in centimeters in the clockwise order. It is guaranteed that the hexagon with the indicated properties and the exactly such sides exists. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of triangles with the sides of one 1 centimeter, into which the hexagon is split. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 6 Input 1 2 1 2 1 2 Output 13 -----Note----- This is what Gerald's hexagon looks like in the first sample: $\theta$ And that's what it looks like in the second sample: $A$
