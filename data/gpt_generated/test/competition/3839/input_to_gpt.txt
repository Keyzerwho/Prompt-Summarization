A spoonerism is a spoken phrase in which the first letters of two of the words are swapped around, often with amusing results. In its most basic form a spoonerism is a two word phrase in which only the first letters of each word are swapped: ```"not picking" --> "pot nicking"``` Your task is to create a function that takes a string of two words, separated by a space: ```words``` and returns a spoonerism of those words in a string, as in the above example. 
tl;dr: Your task is to create a function that takes a string of two words separated by a space, and returns a spoonerism of those words in a string. 

Han Solo and Chewbacca start a space journey to planet Naboo on the Millennium Falcon. During the journey they land at a mysterious planet with high gravity where they find n diamond stones scattered all around. All the stones are of same weight. Each stone has a value according to its purity which can be detected by a special device. They choose to divide the stones fairly among themselves in two halves so that they carry almost equal weights such that the difference between the value of two halves is as small as possible. If n is even, then sizes of two halves must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd, then size of one half must be (n-1)/2 and size of the other half must be (n+1)/2. Given the value of stones, help them to divide the stones among themselves. 
tl;dr: Given a set of n numbers, divide them into subsets of sizes at most different by 1, such that difference in the sum of numbers in each subset is minimum. 

Ivan places knights on infinite chessboard. Initially there are $n$ knights. If there is free cell which is under attack of at least $4$ knights then he places new knight in this cell. Ivan repeats this until there are no such free cells. One can prove that this process is finite. One can also prove that position in the end does not depend on the order in which new knights are placed. Ivan asked you to find initial placement of exactly $n$ knights such that in the end there will be at least $\lfloor \frac{n^{2}}{10} \rfloor$ knights.
