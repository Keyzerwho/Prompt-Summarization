You are given integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied: For every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $2n$ numbers differ not more than by $1$. For example, choose $n = 3$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, $4 + 5 + 2 = 11$, $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$, $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$, $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$, $6 + 1 + 4 = 11$, any two numbers differ by at most $1$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $5 + 1 + 6 = 12$, and $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$, $9$ and $12$ differ more than by $1$.  [Image]  
tl;dr: Given an integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, such that sum of every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle must not differ more than by $1$. 

Given an integer, take the (mean) average of each pair of consecutive digits. Repeat this process until you have a single integer, then return that integer. e.g. 
tl;dr: You are given an integer, take the average of each pair of consecutive digits. Repeat this process until you have a single integer, then return that integer. If the average of two digits is not an integer, round the result up. 

You are given a permutation $p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Let's call the number $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) beautiful, if there exists two indices $l, r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$), such that the numbers $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$. For example, let $p = [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$. In this case, the numbers $1, 3, 5, 6$ are beautiful and $2, 4$ are not. It is because:  if $l = 3$ and $r = 3$ we will have a permutation $[1]$ for $m = 1$;  if $l = 3$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 3$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 5$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 6$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$ for $m = 6$;  it is impossible to take some $l$ and $r$, such that $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$ for $m = 2$ and for $m = 4$.  You are given a permutation $p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$. For all $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) determine if it is a beautiful number or not.

The BFS algorithm is defined as follows.  Consider an undirected graph with vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initialize $q$ as a new queue containing only vertex $1$, mark the vertex $1$ as used.  Extract a vertex $v$ from the head of the queue $q$.  Print the index of vertex $v$.  Iterate in arbitrary order through all such vertices $u$ that $u$ is a neighbor of $v$ and is not marked yet as used. Mark the vertex $u$ as used and insert it into the tail of the queue $q$.  If the queue is not empty, continue from step 2.  Otherwise finish.  Since the order of choosing neighbors of each vertex can vary, it turns out that there may be multiple sequences which BFS can print. In this problem you need to check whether a given sequence corresponds to some valid BFS traversal of the given tree starting from vertex $1$. The tree is an undirected graph, such that there is exactly one simple path between any two vertices.
