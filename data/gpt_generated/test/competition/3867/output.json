Initialize $q$ as a new queue containing only vertex $1$, mark the vertex $1$ as used. Extract a vertex $v$ from the head of the queue $q$. Print the index of vertex $v$. Iterate in arbitrary order through all such vertices $u$ that $u$ is a neighbor of $v$ and is not marked yet as used. Mark the vertex $u$ as used and insert it into the tail of the queue $q$. If the queue is not empty, continue from step 2. Otherwise finish. You are given a tree. Check whether a given sequence of numbers corresponds to some valid BFS traversal of the given tree starting from vertex $1$. \n",
