Masha and Grisha like studying sets of positive integers. One day Grisha has written a set A containing n different integers a_{i} on a blackboard. Now he asks Masha to create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different. Both Masha and Grisha don't like big numbers, so all numbers in A are from 1 to 10^6, and all numbers in B must also be in the same range. Help Masha to create the set B that satisfies Grisha's requirement. 
tl;dr: Set A containing n positive different integers a_{i} are given.  Create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different.  All numbers in A and B are from 1 to 10^6. 

Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party  Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter. 
tl;dr: Calculate the number of different collisions if a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls are given where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0 and collison occurs when two boys like the same girl.  

An array of integers $p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n}$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$. There is a hidden permutation of length $n$. For each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element. Your task is to restore the permutation.

One day Greg and his friends were walking in the forest. Overall there were n people walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms. Greg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k. Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat. Help Greg with this problem.
