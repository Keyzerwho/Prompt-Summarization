Kate likes to count words in text blocks. By words she means continuous sequences of English alphabetic characters (from a to z ). Here are examples: `Hello there, little user5453 374 ())$. I d been using my sphere as a stool. Slow-moving target 839342 was hit by OMGd-63 or K4mp.` contains "words" `['Hello', 'there', 'little', 'user', 'I', 'd', 'been', 'using', 'my','sphere', 'as', 'a', 'stool', 'Slow', 'moving', 'target', 'was', 'hit', 'by', 'OMGd', 'or', 'K', 'mp']` Kate doesn't like some of words and doesn't count them. Words to be excluded are "a", "the", "on", "at", "of", "upon", "in" and "as", case-insensitive. Today Kate's too lazy and have decided to teach her computer to count "words" for her.

You've got array A, consisting of n integers and a positive integer k. Array A is indexed by integers from 1 to n. You need to permute the array elements so that value $\sum_{i = 1}^{n - k}|A [ i ] - A [ i + k ]|$ became minimal possible. In particular, it is allowed not to change order of elements at all.

One day Greg and his friends were walking in the forest. Overall there were n people walking, including Greg. Soon he found himself in front of a river. The guys immediately decided to get across the river. Luckily, there was a boat by the river bank, just where the guys were standing. We know that the boat can hold people with the total weight of at most k kilograms. Greg immediately took a piece of paper and listed there the weights of all people in his group (including himself). It turned out that each person weights either 50 or 100 kilograms. Now Greg wants to know what minimum number of times the boat needs to cross the river to transport the whole group to the other bank. The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k. Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat. Help Greg with this problem.
