The boat needs at least one person to navigate it from one bank to the other. As the boat crosses the river, it can have any non-zero number of passengers as long as their total weight doesn't exceed k. Also Greg is wondering, how many ways there are to transport everybody to the other side in the minimum number of boat rides. Two ways are considered distinct if during some ride they have distinct sets of people on the boat. ",
