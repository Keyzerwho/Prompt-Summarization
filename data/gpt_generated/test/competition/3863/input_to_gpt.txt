Saket loves to play with strings. One day , while he was having fun with Cyclic Permutations of available strings to him, he observed that despite being scarce in numbers Vowels were really clingy.Being clingy means for almost every given string, there was a Cyclic Permutation in which atleast two vowels were together. So he decided to check this property for all the available strings to him. As the number of strings can be very large, help Saket determine whether the given string is clingy or not. 
tl;dr: Given a string return "Yes" if there are two vowels adjacent in it (first and last letter are adjacent), "No" otherwise. 

=====Problem Statement===== ABCXYZ company has up to 100 employees. The company decides to create a unique identification number (UID) for each of its employees. The company has assigned you the task of validating all the randomly generated UIDs. A valid UID must follow the rules below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits (0-9). It should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z & 0-9). No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid UID. 
tl;dr: =====Problem Statement===== You are given a string A valid string must follow the conditions below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits 0 to 9. It should only contain alphanumeric characters a-z, A-Z & 0-9. No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid string. 

Motu and Patlu are racing against each other on a circular track of radius $R$. Initially they are at the same point on the track and will run in same direction .The coach ordered them to run $X$ rounds of the circular field. Patlu wants to know how many times they will meet after the race starts and  before any of them finishes $X$ rounds. But he is busy in warm up so he wants you to calculate this. You are given speed of both Motu and Patlu ($A$ and $B$).  
tl;dr: Find out how many times A and B will meet after the race starts and before completing the $X rounds if they start running from same spot on a circular track of radius $R. Their speed are given. 

Takahashi and Aoki are going to together construct a sequence of integers. First, Takahashi will provide a sequence of integers a, satisfying all of the following conditions:  - The length of a is N.  - Each element in a is an integer between 1 and K, inclusive.  - a is a palindrome, that is, reversing the order of elements in a will result in the same sequence as the original. Then, Aoki will perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times:  - Move the first element in a to the end of a. How many sequences a can be obtained after this procedure, modulo 10^9+7  -----Constraints-----  - 1 N 10^9  - 1 K 10^9
