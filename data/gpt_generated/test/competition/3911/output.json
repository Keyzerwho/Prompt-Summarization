Then, you will add the other n - 1 slimes one by one. When you add a slime, you place it at the right of all already placed slimes. Then, while the last two slimes in the row have the same value v, you combine them together to create a slime with value v + 1. You would like to see what the final state of the row is after you've added all n slimes. Please print the values of the slimes in the row from left to right. ",
