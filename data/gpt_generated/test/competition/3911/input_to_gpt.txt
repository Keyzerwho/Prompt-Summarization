Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order. For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5] Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6
tl;dr: You are given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string. 

Chef is good at making pancakes. Generally he gets requests to serve N pancakes at once. He serves them in the form of a stack. A pancake can be treated as a circular disk with some radius. Chef needs to take care that when he places a pancake on the top of the stack the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than 1.  Additionally all radii should be positive integers, and the bottom most pancake should have its radius as 1. Chef wants you to find out in how many ways can he create a stack containing N pancakes. Input First line of the input contains T (T <= 1000) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000) denoting the size of the required stack. Output For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size N can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo 1000000007. 
tl;dr: Find the number of ways in which a stack of circular disk can be arranged in such a way that radius of disk on the top of the stack should not exceed the radius of the largest disk in the stack by more than 1.

Let's say we have a number, `num`. Find the number of values of `n` such that: there exists `n` consecutive **positive** values that sum up to `num`. A positive number is `> 0`. `n` can also be 1. ```python #
tl;dr: Given `num`. Find the total count of existing consecutive **positive** values that sum up to `num`. A positive number is `> 0`. `n` can also be 1. ```python #

Your friend recently gave you some slimes for your birthday. You have n slimes all initially with value 1. You are going to play a game with these slimes. Initially, you put a single slime by itself in a row. Then, you will add the other n - 1 slimes one by one. When you add a slime, you place it at the right of all already placed slimes. Then, while the last two slimes in the row have the same value v, you combine them together to create a slime with value v + 1. You would like to see what the final state of the row is after you've added all n slimes. Please print the values of the slimes in the row from left to right.
