Han Solo and Chewbacca start a space journey to planet Naboo on the Millennium Falcon. During the journey they land at a mysterious planet with high gravity where they find n diamond stones scattered all around. All the stones are of same weight. Each stone has a value according to its purity which can be detected by a special device. They choose to divide the stones fairly among themselves in two halves so that they carry almost equal weights such that the difference between the value of two halves is as small as possible. If n is even, then sizes of two halves must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd, then size of one half must be (n-1)/2 and size of the other half must be (n+1)/2. Given the value of stones, help them to divide the stones among themselves. 
tl;dr: Given a set of n numbers, divide them into subsets of sizes at most different by 1, such that difference in the sum of numbers in each subset is minimum. 

Initially, you have the array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  For example, consider the sequence of five moves:   You take the first element $a_1$, append its copy to the end of the array and get $a = [1, 1]$.  You take the first element $a_1$, increase it by $1$ and get $a = [2, 1]$.  You take the second element $a_2$, append its copy to the end of the array and get $a = [2, 1, 1]$.  You take the first element $a_1$, append its copy to the end of the array and get $a = [2, 1, 1, 2]$.  You take the fourth element $a_4$, increase it by $1$ and get $a = [2, 1, 1, 3]$.  Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

Your friend recently gave you some slimes for your birthday. You have n slimes all initially with value 1. You are going to play a game with these slimes. Initially, you put a single slime by itself in a row. Then, you will add the other n - 1 slimes one by one. When you add a slime, you place it at the right of all already placed slimes. Then, while the last two slimes in the row have the same value v, you combine them together to create a slime with value v + 1. You would like to see what the final state of the row is after you've added all n slimes. Please print the values of the slimes in the row from left to right.
