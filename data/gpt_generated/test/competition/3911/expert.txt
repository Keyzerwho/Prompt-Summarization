 You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$). In one move, you can do one of the following things:   Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array).  Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input will contain a single integer, n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000). -----Output----- Output a single line with k integers, where k is the number of slimes in the row after you've finished the procedure described in the problem statement. The i-th of these numbers should be the value of the i-th slime from the left. -----Examples----- Input 1 Output 1 Input 2 Output 2 Input 3 Output 2 1 Input 8 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample, we only have a single slime with value 1. The final state of the board is just a single slime with value 1. In the second sample, we perform the following steps: Initially we place a single slime in a row by itself. Thus, row is initially 1. Then, we will add another slime. The row is now 1 1. Since two rightmost slimes have the same values, we should replace these slimes with one with value 2. Thus, the final state of the board is 2. In the third sample, after adding the first two slimes, our row is 2. After adding one more slime, the row becomes 2 1. In the last sample, the steps look as follows:   1  2  2 1  3  3 1  3 2  3 2 1  4
