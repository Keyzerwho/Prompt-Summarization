 Polycarp takes part in a quadcopter competition. According to the rules a flying robot should: 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers x_1 and y_1 ( - 100 ≤ x_1, y_1 ≤ 100) — coordinates of the quadcopter starting (and finishing) point. The second line contains two integer numbers x_2 and y_2 ( - 100 ≤ x_2, y_2 ≤ 100) — coordinates of the flag. It is guaranteed that the quadcopter starting point and the flag do not coincide. -----Output----- Print the length of minimal path of the quadcopter to surround the flag and return back. -----Examples----- Input 1 5 5 2 Output 18 Input 0 1 0 0 Output 8
