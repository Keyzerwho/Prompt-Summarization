Lately, Mr. Chanek frequently plays the game Arena of Greed. As the name implies, the game's goal is to find the greediest of them all, who will then be crowned king of Compfestnesia. The game is played by two people taking turns, where Mr. Chanek takes the first turn. Initially, there is a treasure chest containing $N$ gold coins. The game ends if there are no more gold coins in the chest. In each turn, the players can make one of the following moves:  Take one gold coin from the chest.  Take half of the gold coins on the chest. This move is only available if the number of coins in the chest is even.  Both players will try to maximize the number of coins they have. Mr. Chanek asks your help to find the maximum number of coins he can get at the end of the game if both he and the opponent plays optimally.

Complete the solution so that it takes the object (JavaScript/CoffeeScript) or hash (ruby) passed in and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs.  The format should be "KEY = VALUE". Each key/value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair. **

Polycarp takes part in a quadcopter competition. According to the rules a flying robot should:   start the race from some point of a field,  go around the flag,  close cycle returning back to the starting point.  Polycarp knows the coordinates of the starting point (x_1, y_1) and the coordinates of the point where the flag is situated (x_2, y_2). Polycarp s quadcopter can fly only parallel to the sides of the field each tick changing exactly one coordinate by 1. It means that in one tick the quadcopter can fly from the point (x, y) to any of four points: (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1) or (x, y + 1). Thus the quadcopter path is a closed cycle starting and finishing in (x_1, y_1) and containing the point (x_2, y_2) strictly inside.  [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example: the starting (and finishing) point is in (1, 5) and the flag is in (5, 2).  What is the minimal length of the quadcopter path
