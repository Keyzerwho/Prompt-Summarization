Alice's school is planning to take some students from her class on a field trip. Alice is really excited about it. There are a total of S students in her class. But due to budget constraints, the school is planning to take only N students for the trip. These students will be picked randomly. And each student has equal chance of being picked. Alice's friend circle has M students including her. Though she is excited about the field trip, she will enjoy it only if there are atleast K of her friends with her on the trip. She is wondering what are the chances of that happening. She needs your help. Tell her the probability that she will enjoy given that she goes on the trip. 
tl;dr: Only N items can be chosen randomly from a total of S items. You need M item including your one personal item. If there are atleast K item which are required and one your own item. What is the probability that you will purchase your K item with your one personal item. 

There are $n$ lamps on a line, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each one has an initial state off ($0$) or on ($1$). You're given $k$ subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, such that the intersection of any three subsets is empty. In other words, for all $1 \le i_1 < i_2 < i_3 \le k$, $A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap A_{i_3} = \varnothing$. In one operation, you can choose one of these $k$ subsets and switch the state of all lamps in it. It is guaranteed that, with the given subsets, it's possible to make all lamps be simultaneously on using this type of operation. Let $m_i$ be the minimum number of operations you have to do in order to make the $i$ first lamps be simultaneously on. Note that there is no condition upon the state of other lamps (between $i+1$ and $n$), they can be either off or on. You have to compute $m_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$.

This is now a little serie :) Funny Dots You will get two Integer n (width) and m (height) and your task is to draw following pattern. Each line is seperated with '\n'. Both integers are equal or greater than 1. No need to check for invalid parameters. e.g.:                                           +---+---+---+             +---+                         | o | o | o | dot(1,1) => | o |          dot(3,2) =>    +---+---+---+                         +---+                         | o | o | o |                                           +---+---+---+  Serie: ASCII Fun ASCII Fun #1: X-Shape ASCII Fun #2: Funny Dots ASCII Fun #3: Puzzle Tiles ASCII Fun #4: Build a pyrami

Polycarp takes part in a quadcopter competition. According to the rules a flying robot should:   start the race from some point of a field,  go around the flag,  close cycle returning back to the starting point.  Polycarp knows the coordinates of the starting point (x_1, y_1) and the coordinates of the point where the flag is situated (x_2, y_2). Polycarp s quadcopter can fly only parallel to the sides of the field each tick changing exactly one coordinate by 1. It means that in one tick the quadcopter can fly from the point (x, y) to any of four points: (x - 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y - 1) or (x, y + 1). Thus the quadcopter path is a closed cycle starting and finishing in (x_1, y_1) and containing the point (x_2, y_2) strictly inside.  [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example: the starting (and finishing) point is in (1, 5) and the flag is in (5, 2).  What is the minimal length of the quadcopter path
