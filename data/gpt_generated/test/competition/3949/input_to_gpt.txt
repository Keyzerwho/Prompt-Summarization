In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible. The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Toad Pimple has an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. We say that $y$ is reachable from $x$ if $x<y$ and there exists an integer array $p$ such that $x = p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_k=y$, and $a_{p_i}\, \&\, a_{p_{i+1}} > 0$ for all integers $i$ such that $1 \leq i < k$. Here $\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. You are given $q$ pairs of indices, check reachability for each of them.

# A History Lesson Soundex is an interesting phonetic algorithm developed nearly 100 years ago for indexing names as they are pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex # Preface I first read about Soundex over 30 years ago. At the time it seemed to me almost  like  A.I. that you could just type in somebody's name the way it sounded and there was still a pretty good chance it could match the correct person record. That was about the same year as the first "Terminator" movie so it was easy for me to put 2 and 2 together and conclude that Arnie must have had some kind of futuristic Soundex chip in his titanium skull helping him to locate ```Serah Coner```... or was it ```Sarh Connor```... or maybe ```Sayra Cunnarr```... :-) # Task In this Kata you will encode strings using a Soundex variation called "American Soundex" using the following (case insensitive) steps: * Save the first letter. Remove all occurrences of ```h``` and ```w``` except first letter. * Replace all consonants (include the first letter) with digits as follows:  * ```b```, ```f```, ```p```, ```v``` = 1  * ```c```, ```g```, ```j```, ```k```, ```q```, ```s```, ```x```, ```z``` = 2  * ```d```, ```t``` = 3  * ```l``` = 4  * ```m```, ```n``` = 5  * ```r``` = 6 * Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit. * Remove all occurrences of ```a```, ```e```, ```i```, ```o```, ```u```, ```y``` except first letter. * If first symbol is a digit replace it with letter saved on step 1. * Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except first letter and 3 digits after it ## Input A space separated string of one or more names. E.g. ```Sarah Connor``` ## Output Space separated string of equivalent Soundex codes (the first character of each code must be uppercase). E.g. ```S600 C560``

A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care. There is an $n\times m$ grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell. An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable. Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.   There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column.  If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement.  If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement.  Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).
