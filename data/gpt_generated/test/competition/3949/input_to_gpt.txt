Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012 N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N   (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches. For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows: Match Team A Team B Ad revenue 1 1 2 7  2 1 3 0  3 1 4 2  4 2 3 7  5 2 4 5  6 3 4 2  Thus the total advertising revenue is 23. 
tl;dr: You are given N teams which can play with each exactly one time.Each team is assigned a strength as a positive integer.Find the sum of all the absolute difference between the strengths of all the possible two matches. 

Let's define the following recurrence: $$a_{n+1} = a_{n} + minDigit(a_{n}) \cdot maxDigit(a_{n}).$$ Here $minDigit(x)$ and $maxDigit(x)$ are the minimal and maximal digits in the decimal representation of $x$ without leading zeroes. For examples refer to notes. Your task is calculate $a_{K}$ for given $a_{1}$ and $K$.

A monopole magnet is a magnet that only has one pole, either north or south. They don't actually exist since real magnets have two poles, but this is a programming contest problem, so we don't care. There is an $n\times m$ grid. Initially, you may place some north magnets and some south magnets into the cells. You are allowed to place as many magnets as you like, even multiple in the same cell. An operation is performed as follows. Choose a north magnet and a south magnet to activate. If they are in the same row or the same column and they occupy different cells, then the north magnet moves one unit closer to the south magnet. Otherwise, if they occupy the same cell or do not share a row or column, then nothing changes. Note that the south magnets are immovable. Each cell of the grid is colored black or white. Let's consider ways to place magnets in the cells so that the following conditions are met.   There is at least one south magnet in every row and every column.  If a cell is colored black, then it is possible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement.  If a cell is colored white, then it is impossible for a north magnet to occupy this cell after some sequence of operations from the initial placement.  Determine if it is possible to place magnets such that these conditions are met. If it is possible, find the minimum number of north magnets required (there are no requirements on the number of south magnets).
