The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for $130$ years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem! 
tl;dr: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  

Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 5. If any of the permutations is divisible by 5 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: If any of the permutations of a given number  N is divisible by 5, then print 1 else print 0. 

We have a permutation of the integers from 1 through N, p_1, p_2, .., p_N. We also have M pairs of two integers between 1 and N (inclusive), represented as (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), .., (x_M,y_M). AtCoDeer the deer is going to perform the following operation on p as many times as desired so that the number of i (1   i   N) such that p_i = i is maximized:  - Choose j such that 1   j   M, and swap p_{x_j} and p_{y_j}. Find the maximum possible number of i such that p_i = i after operations. -----Constraints-----  - 2   N   10^5  - 1   M   10^5  - p is a permutation of integers from 1 through N.  - 1   x_j,y_j   N  - x_j   y_j  - If i   j, \{x_i,y_i\}   \{x_j,y_j\}.  - All values in input are integers.

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$. The string $s$ consists of lowercase Latin letters and at most one wildcard character '*', the string $t$ consists only of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $s$ equals $n$, the length of the string $t$ equals $m$. The wildcard character '*' in the string $s$ (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase Latin letters. No other character of $s$ can be replaced with anything. If it is possible to replace a wildcard character '*' in $s$ to obtain a string $t$, then the string $t$ matches the pattern $s$. For example, if $s=$"aba*aba" then the following strings match it "abaaba", "abacaba" and "abazzzaba", but the following strings do not match: "ababa", "abcaaba", "codeforces", "aba1aba", "aba aba". If the given string $t$ matches the given string $s$, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".
