The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the $k$ TV shows. You know the schedule for the next $n$ days: a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le k$), where $a_i$ is the show, the episode of which will be shown in $i$-th day. The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately. How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows $d$ ($1 \le d \le n$) days in a row  In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of $d$ consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Emuskald is a well-known illusionist. One of his trademark tricks involves a set of magical boxes. The essence of the trick is in packing the boxes inside other boxes. From the top view each magical box looks like a square with side length equal to 2^{k} (k is an integer, k   0) units. A magical box v can be put inside a magical box u, if side length of v is strictly less than the side length of u. In particular, Emuskald can put 4 boxes of side length 2^{k} - 1 into one box of side length 2^{k}, or as in the following figure:  [Image]  Emuskald is about to go on tour performing around the world, and needs to pack his magical boxes for the trip. He has decided that the best way to pack them would be inside another magical box, but magical boxes are quite expensive to make. Help him find the smallest magical box that can fit all his boxes.
