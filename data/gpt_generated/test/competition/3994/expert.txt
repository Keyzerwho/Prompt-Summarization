 You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$), the number of lights. The next line contains a string $s$ of $n$ characters. The $i$-th character is "1", if the $i$-th lamp is initially on. Otherwise, $i$-th character is "0". The $i$-th of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le 5$)  — the parameters of the $i$-th light. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. -----Examples----- Input 3 101 3 3 3 2 3 1 Output 2 Input 4 1111 3 4 5 2 3 1 3 2 Output 4 Input 6 011100 5 3 5 5 2 4 3 5 4 2 1 5 Output 6 -----Note----- For first example, the lamps' states are shown in the picture above. The largest number of simultaneously on lamps is $2$ (e.g. at the moment $2$). In the second example, all lights are initially on. So the answer is $4$.
