Write a program, which takes an integer N and if the number is less than 10 then display "Thanks for helping Chef!" otherwise print "-1". 
tl;dr: Display "Thanks for helping Chef!" if given number N is less than 10, otherwise print "-1". 

Given that  ``` f0 = '0' f1 = '01' f2 = '010' = f1 + f0 f3 = '01001' = f2 + f1 ``` You will be given a number and your task is to return the `nth` fibonacci string. For example: ``` solve(2) = '010' solve(3) = '01001' ``` More examples in test cases. Good luck!

Kontti language is a finnish word play game. You add `-kontti` to the end of each word and then swap their characters until and including the first vowel ("aeiouy");  For example the word `tame` becomes `kome-tantti`; `fruity` becomes `koity-fruntti` and so on. If no vowel is present, the word stays the same. Write a string method that turns a sentence into kontti language

It is a holiday season, and Koala is decorating his house with cool lights! He owns $n$ lights, all of which flash periodically. After taking a quick glance at them, Koala realizes that each of his lights can be described with two parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$. Light with parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$ will toggle (on to off, or off to on) every $a_i$ seconds starting from the $b_i$-th second. In other words, it will toggle at the moments $b_i$, $b_i + a_i$, $b_i + 2 \cdot a_i$ and so on. You know for each light whether it's initially on or off and its corresponding parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$. Koala is wondering what is the maximum number of lights that will ever be on at the same time. So you need to find that out.  [Image] Here is a graphic for the first example.
