For each candle from the 1st to the Nth the following algorithm is applied: if the observed candle is lit then states of this candle and all candles before it are changed to the opposite. Which candles will remain lit after applying the algorithm to all candles in the order they are placed in the line  #

In this Kata your task will be to return the count of pairs that have consecutive numbers as follows: ```Haskell pairs([1,2,5,8,-4,-3,7,6,5]) = 3 The pairs are selected as follows [(1,2),(5,8),(-4,-3),(7,6),5] --the first pair is (1,2) and the numbers in the pair are consecutive; Count = 1 --the second pair is (5,8) and are not consecutive --the third pair is (-4,-3), consecutive. Count = 2 --the fourth pair is (7,6), also consecutive. Count = 3.  --the last digit has no pair, so we ignore. ``` More examples in the test cases.  Good luck!

You are given a directed graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. There is a token in vertex $1$. The following actions are allowed:   Token movement. To move the token from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ if there is an edge $u \to v$ in the graph. This action takes $1$ second.  Graph transposition. To transpose all the edges in the graph: replace each edge $u \to v$ by an edge $v \to u$. This action takes increasingly more time: $k$-th transposition takes $2^{k-1}$ seconds, i.e. the first transposition takes $1$ second, the second one takes $2$ seconds, the third one takes $4$ seconds, and so on.  The goal is to move the token from vertex $1$ to vertex $n$ in the shortest possible time. Print this time modulo $998\,244\,353$.

In 1978 AD the great Sir Isaac Newton, whilst proving that $\mathcal{P}$ is a strict superset of $\mathcal{NP}$, defined the Beta Alpha Pi Zeta function $f$ as follows over any sequence of positive integers $a_1, \dots , a_ n$. Given integers $1\leq i\leq j\leq n$, we define $f(i, j)$ as $\gcd (a_ i, a_{i+1}, \dots , a_{j-1}, a_ j)$.  About a century later Lothar Collatz applied this function to the sequence $1, 1, 1, \dots , 1$, and observed that $f$ always equalled $1$. Based on this, he conjectured that $f$ is always a constant function, no matter what the sequence $a_ i$ is. This conjecture, now widely known as the Collatz Conjecture, is one of the major open problems in botanical studies. (The Strong Collatz Conjecture claims that however many values $f$ takes on, the real part is always $\frac{1}{2}$.) You, a budding young cultural anthropologist, have decided to disprove this conjecture. Given a sequence $a_ i$, calculate how many different values $f$ takes on.
