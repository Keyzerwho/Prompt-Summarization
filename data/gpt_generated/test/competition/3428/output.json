            "text": " In 1978 AD the great Sir Isaac Newton, whilst proving that $\\mathcal{P}$ is a strict superset of $\\mathcal{NP}$, defined the Beta Alpha Pi Zeta function $f$ as follows over any sequence of positive integers $a_1, \\dots , a_ n$. Given integers $1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n$, we define $f(i, j)$ as $\\gcd (a_ i, a_{i+1}, \\dots , a_{j-1}, a_ j)$. About a century later Lothar Collatz applied this function to the sequence $1, 1, 1, \\dots , 1$, and observed that $f$ always equalled $1$. Based on this, he conjectured that $f$ is always a constant function, no matter what the sequence $a_ i$ is. This conjecture, now widely known as the Collatz Conjecture, is one of the major open problems in botanical studies. (The Strong Collatz Conjecture claims that however many values $f$ takes on, the real part is always $\\frac{1}{2}$.) You, a budding young cultural anthropologist, have decided to disprove this conjecture. Given a sequence $a_ i$, calculate how many different values $f$ takes on.",
