You have $n$ barrels lined up in a row, numbered from left to right from one. Initially, the $i$-th barrel contains $a_i$ liters of water. You can pour water from one barrel to another. In one act of pouring, you can choose two different barrels $x$ and $y$ (the $x$-th barrel shouldn't be empty) and pour any possible amount of water from barrel $x$ to barrel $y$ (possibly, all water). You may assume that barrels have infinite capacity, so you can pour any amount of water in each of them.  Calculate the maximum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum amount of water in the barrels, if you can pour water at most $k$ times. Some examples:   if you have four barrels, each containing $5$ liters of water, and $k = 1$, you may pour $5$ liters from the second barrel into the fourth, so the amounts of water in the barrels are $[5, 0, 5, 10]$, and the difference between the maximum and the minimum is $10$;  if all barrels are empty, you can't make any operation, so the difference between the maximum and the minimum amount is still $0$.

Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.  Program is very simple, Given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers. 
tl;dr: Write a program to add given two integers A and B. 

Oleg writes down the history of the days he lived. For each day he decides if it was good or bad. Oleg calls a non-empty sequence of days a zebra, if it starts with a bad day, ends with a bad day, and good and bad days are alternating in it. Let us denote bad days as 0 and good days as 1. Then, for example, sequences of days 0, 010, 01010 are zebras, while sequences 1, 0110, 0101 are not. Oleg tells you the story of days he lived in chronological order in form of string consisting of 0 and 1. Now you are interested if it is possible to divide Oleg's life history into several subsequences, each of which is a zebra, and the way it can be done. Each day must belong to exactly one of the subsequences. For each of the subsequences, days forming it must be ordered chronologically. Note that subsequence does not have to be a group of consecutive days.
