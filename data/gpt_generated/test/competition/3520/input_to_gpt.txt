You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine whether we can turn S into a palindrome by repeating the operation of swapping two adjacent characters. If it is possible, find the minimum required number of operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |S| \leq 2   10^5  - S consists of lowercase English letters.

There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

You are given integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied: For every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $2n$ numbers differ not more than by $1$. For example, choose $n = 3$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, $4 + 5 + 2 = 11$, $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$, $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$, $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$, $6 + 1 + 4 = 11$, any two numbers differ by at most $1$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $5 + 1 + 6 = 12$, and $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$, $9$ and $12$ differ more than by $1$.  [Image]

Everyone wants to live as long a life as possible. As time progresses, technology progresses. Various anti-aging pills get introduced to the market at various times which allow a person to age more slowly than normal. In particular, an $x$-$y$ pill, when taken regularly, ages your body only $y$ seconds over the course of $x$ seconds. So, if you took a $100$-$87$ pill regularly, then over the next $100$ seconds, your body would only age $87$ seconds. You can only take one of these pills at a time (or none at all). The only downside to using one of these pills is that due to the change in regimen, if you switch to a pill, it automatically ages you $c$ seconds. The value of $c$ is the same for all pills. Any time you switch to an $x$-$y$ pill, you can take it for any number of seconds, but you can only switch to a pill at or after the time it first becomes available on the market. For the purposes of this problem assume that your life starts at time $t = 0$ seconds and that without the aid of any pills, you would live to be $n$ seconds old. Given information about each different pill introduced into the market (the time it is introduced, in seconds, and its corresponding $x$ and $y$ values as previously described) and $c$, the number of seconds you automatically age when switching pills (or switching to a pill from no pill at all), determine the longest you can live, over all possible schedule of pills you could take.
