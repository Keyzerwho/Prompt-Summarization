You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.  Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1. Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.

Calculate how many different strings T of length n can be composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of Longest Common Subsequence between S and T is n - 1. 

Numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots n$ (each integer from $1$ to $n$ once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the board and write one integer $\frac{a + b}{2}$ rounded up instead. You should perform the given operation $n - 1$ times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.  For example, if $n = 4$, the following course of action is optimal:  choose $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3, 3]$;  choose $a = 3$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3]$;  choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $2$, and the whiteboard contains $[2]$.  It's easy to see that after $n - 1$ operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.

There are $n$ athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete   the athlete number $i$ has the strength $s_i$. You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team. You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams $A$ and $B$ so that the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ is as small as possible, where $\max(A)$ is the maximum strength of an athlete from team $A$, and $\min(B)$ is the minimum strength of an athlete from team $B$. For example, if $n=5$ and the strength of the athletes is $s=[3, 1, 2, 6, 4]$, then one of the possible split into teams is:   first team: $A = [1, 2, 4]$,  second team: $B = [3, 6]$.  In this case, the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ will be equal to $|4-3|=1$. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams. Print the minimum value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$. 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers. You want to split the integers into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list $A$ to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list $B$. 

A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string. B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time. You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).
