 Given a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a', you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes). 

-----Input----- The first and only line consists of a string $S$ ($ 1 \le |S| \le 5\,000 $). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'. -----Output----- Print "YES" or "NO", according to the condition. -----Examples----- Input aaabccc Output YES Input bbacc Output NO Input aabc Output YES -----Note----- Consider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'.  Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct. Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.
