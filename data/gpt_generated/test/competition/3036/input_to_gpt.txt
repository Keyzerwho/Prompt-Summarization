Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input. 
tl;dr: Your task is to write a function get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) which returns a dictionary {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} 

-----General Statement:----- Given the actual high and low temperatures for the day and the normal high and low temperatures for that day, calculate the average difference from normal. 
tl;dr: Determine the average of the difference of the high temperatures and the difference of the low temperatures. 

Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $\{0,1, ,M-1\}$, for some positive integer $M$. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo $M$. What are the residues modulo $M$ that Ajs cannot obtain with this action

The world-renowned Swedish Chef is planning a gourmet three-course dinner for some muppets: a starter course, a main course, and a dessert. His famous Swedish cook-book offers a wide variety of choices for each of these three courses, though some of them do not go well together (for instance, you of course cannot serve chocolate moose and sooted shreemp at the same dinner).  Each potential dish has a list of ingredients. Each ingredient is in turn available from a few different brands. Each brand is of course unique in its own special way, so using a particular brand of an ingredient will always result in a completely different dinner experience than using another brand of the same ingredient. Some common ingredients such as p l rber may appear in two of the three chosen dishes, or in all three of them. When an ingredient is used in more than one of the three selected dishes, Swedish Chef will use the same brand of the ingredient in all of them. While waiting for the meecaroo, Swedish Chef starts wondering: how many different dinner experiences are there that he could make, by different choices of dishes and brands for the ingredients
