Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

Given two strings representing two complex numbers. You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition. 
tl;dr: Write program to return a string representing the multiplication of given two  strings of complex numbers. 

A tree is a graph with n vertices and exactly n - 1 edges; this graph should meet the following condition: there exists exactly one shortest (by number of edges) path between any pair of its vertices. A subtree of a tree T is a tree with both vertices and edges as subsets of vertices and edges of T. You're given a tree with n vertices. Consider its vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. Additionally an integer is written on every vertex of this tree. Initially the integer written on the i-th vertex is equal to v_{i}. In one move you can apply the following operation:  Select the subtree of the given tree that includes the vertex with number 1.  Increase (or decrease) by one all the integers which are written on the vertices of that subtree.  Calculate the minimum number of moves that is required to make all the integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero.

Arnar is playing his favourite video game Association of Myths. He s playing a character by the name of Lumen. Lumen has a special ability where she can shoot a laser beam across the entire map killing all enemies it hits. The only drawback is that the beam is rather narrow and Arnar isn t always sure where the enemies are located. He now needs your help to determine where the enemies are hiding so he can hit them (and hopefully win the game). Arnar is very serious about this game and is therefore willing to meticulously research how the opponents move. He knows they only travel in a straight path called the  medial path . We can therefore describe their location as a function $f$ of a single variable. After much thought Arnar has concluded that $f$ can be described by\[ c\int _ a^b \left(t_1\Gamma (x) + \sqrt [t_2]{\log (\operatorname {erf}(t_3 x))} - J_ k(x)^{t_4}\right)dx \] where $\log $ is the natural logarithm,\[ \Gamma (z) = \int _0^{\infty } x^{z - 1} e^{-x} dx, \]\[ \operatorname {erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt {\pi }} \int _0^x e^{-t^2} dt, \] and\[ J_ k(x) = \frac{1}{\pi } \int _0^{\pi } \cos (k \tau - x \sin \tau ) d \tau . \] Arnar thinks that it maybe a bit tough for you to compute $f$ as previously described so he tells you it is enough to calculate the $r$-th degree Taylor polynomial around $0$, i.e.\[ P(x) = \sum _{i = 0}^r \frac{f^{(i)}(0)}{i!}x^i. \] Arnar is a afraid he was too aggressive when approximating $f$ with $P$ so he would like to modify $P$ a little bit further. He knows that as the game progresses his opponent will have more in-game currency and will therefore buy better, more agile shoes. To account for this Arnar recursively defines a sequence of polynomials by\[ P_0(x) = P(x), \quad P_ n(x) = \sum _{i = 0}^{r + n} P_{n - 1}(i) x^i. \] Arnar finally notes that during the endgame phase the opponent will probably have to go to the bathroom and to account for that he wants reduce the size of the final polynomial in his sequence. He therefore takes $P_ s$ and differentiates it $\operatorname {deg}(P_ s) + 1$ times and calls the outcome $g$. Arnar is now satisfied that\[ \frac{(g(n) + l)^2}{\pi e} + \frac{1}{l + 1} \] gives the location of his opponent. Why does Arnar take the last step  Well, Arnar won t tell you because he s afraid you will be able to beat him in Association of Myths if he tells you all his secrets. He also requests that you give him the answer to at least two correct decimal places since his mouse can track changes as small as a hundredth of an in-game unit of length.
