 You're given a function $f$ of a single variable. After much thought Arnar has concluded that $f$ can be described by\[ c\int _ a^b \left(t_1\Gamma (x) + \sqrt [t_2]{\log (\operatorname {erf}(t_3 x))} - J_ k(x)^{t_4}\right)dx \] where $\log $ is the natural logarithm,\[ \Gamma (z) = \int _0^{\infty } x^{z - 1} e^{-x} dx, \]\[ \operatorname {erf}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt {\pi }} \int _0^x e^{-t^2} dt, \] and\[ J_ k(x) = \frac{1}{\pi } \int _0^{\pi } \cos (k \tau - x \sin \tau ) d \tau . \] Arnar thinks that it maybe a bit tough for you to compute $f$ as previously described so he tells you it is enough to calculate the $r$-th degree Taylor polynomial around $0$, i.e.\[ P(x) = \sum _{i = 0}^r \frac{f^{(i)}(0)}{i!}x^i. \] Arnar is a afraid he was too aggressive when approximating $f$ with $P$ so he would like to modify $P$ a little bit further
-----Input----- The first line of the input starts with three real numbers $a, b, c$, $-10^9 \leq a \leq b \leq 10^9$ and $1 \leq c \leq 10^9$. These numbers will have at most 6 digits after the decimal point. The second line has four integers $t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$, $1 \leq t_ i \leq 10^9$. The third line has five integers $n, k, r, s, l$, $1 \leq n, k, r, s, l \leq 10^3$. -----Output----- The output should consist of one line containing the location of Arnarâ€™s opponent as described above. -----Examples----- Sample Input: -99.99 99.99 9999.99 99 9 999 9999 9 99 9 99 9 Sample Output: 9.585073
