You are given a sequence a = \{a_1, ..., a_N\} with all zeros, and a sequence b = \{b_1, ..., b_N\} consisting of 0 and 1. The length of both is N. You can perform Q kinds of operations. The i-th operation is as follows:  - Replace each of a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, ..., a_{r_i} with 1. Minimize the hamming distance between a and b, that is, the number of i such that a_i \neq b_i, by performing some of the Q operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 200,000  - b consists of 0 and 1.  - 1 \leq Q \leq 200,000  - 1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq N  - If i \neq j, either l_i \neq l_j or r_i \neq r_j.

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Now elections are held in Berland and you want to win them. More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you. There are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free. Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \rightarrow {1, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$. Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.

The chef is trying to solve some pattern problems, Chef wants your help to code it. Chef has one number K to form a new pattern. Help the chef to code this pattern problem. 
tl;dr: Decode the given pattern and generate new pattern for number K. 

Recently a Golden Circle of Beetlovers was found in Byteland. It is a circle route going through $n \cdot k$ cities. The cities are numerated from $1$ to $n \cdot k$, the distance between the neighboring cities is exactly $1$ km. Sergey does not like beetles, he loves burgers. Fortunately for him, there are $n$ fast food restaurants on the circle, they are located in the $1$-st, the $(k + 1)$-st, the $(2k + 1)$-st, and so on, the $((n-1)k + 1)$-st cities, i.e. the distance between the neighboring cities with fast food restaurants is $k$ km. Sergey began his journey at some city $s$ and traveled along the circle, making stops at cities each $l$ km ($l > 0$), until he stopped in $s$ once again. Sergey then forgot numbers $s$ and $l$, but he remembers that the distance from the city $s$ to the nearest fast food restaurant was $a$ km, and the distance from the city he stopped at after traveling the first $l$ km from $s$ to the nearest fast food restaurant was $b$ km. Sergey always traveled in the same direction along the circle, but when he calculated distances to the restaurants, he considered both directions. Now Sergey is interested in two integers. The first integer $x$ is the minimum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to $s$. The second integer $y$ is the maximum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to $s$.
