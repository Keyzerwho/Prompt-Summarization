 You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1   i < j   N. 

-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^11) — the number of bamboos and the maximum total length of cut parts, in meters. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — the required heights of bamboos, in meters. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum value of d such that Vladimir can reach his goal. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 1 3 5 Output 3 Input 3 40 10 30 50 Output 32 -----Note----- In the first example Vladimir can check bamboos each 3 days. Then he will cut the first and the second bamboos after 3 days, and the third bamboo after 6 days. The total length of cut parts is 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 meters.
