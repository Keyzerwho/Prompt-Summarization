He thinks it would be nice if there are n bamboos in a row, and the i-th from the left is a_{i} meters high.  Vladimir has just planted n bamboos in a row, each of which has height 0 meters right now, but they grow 1 meter each day. In order to make the partition nice Vladimir can cut each bamboo once at any height (no greater that the height of the bamboo), and then the bamboo will stop growing. Vladimir wants to check the bamboos each d days (i.e. d days after he planted, then after 2d days and so on), and cut the bamboos that reached the required height. Vladimir wants the total length of bamboo parts he will cut off to be no greater than k meters. What is the maximum value d he can choose so that he can achieve what he wants without cutting off more than k meters of bamboo ",
