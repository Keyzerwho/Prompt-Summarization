You are given $n$ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $n$ points is strictly convex, that is, the polygon is convex, and there are no three collinear points (i.e. lying in the same straight line). The points are numbered from $1$ to $n$, in clockwise order. We define the distance between two points $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ as their Manhattan distance: $$d(p_1, p_2) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|.$$ Furthermore, we define the perimeter of a polygon, as the sum of Manhattan distances between all adjacent pairs of points on it; if the points on the polygon are ordered as $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ $(k \geq 3)$, then the perimeter of the polygon is $d(p_1, p_2) + d(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + d(p_k, p_1)$. For some parameter $k$, let's consider all the polygons that can be formed from the given set of points, having any $k$ vertices, such that the polygon is not self-intersecting. For each such polygon, let's consider its perimeter. Over all such perimeters, we define $f(k)$ to be the maximal perimeter. Please note, when checking whether a polygon is self-intersecting, that the edges of a polygon are still drawn as straight lines. For instance, in the following pictures:  [Image]  In the middle polygon, the order of points ($p_1, p_3, p_2, p_4$) is not valid, since it is a self-intersecting polygon. The right polygon (whose edges resemble the Manhattan distance) has the same order and is not self-intersecting, but we consider edges as straight lines. The correct way to draw this polygon is ($p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$), which is the left polygon. Your task is to compute $f(3), f(4), \ldots, f(n)$. In other words, find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e. $3$ to $n$). 
tl;dr: You are given $n$ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $n$ points is strictly convex, and there are no three collinear points. The points are numbered from $1$ to $n$, in clockwise order. Find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e. $3$ to $n$). 

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.   Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   
tl;dr: You have to apply + and - symbol between the given list non-negative integers to achieve the target S. In how many ways are there to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   

You are given three sticks with positive integer lengths of a, b, and c centimeters. You can increase length of some of them by some positive integer number of centimeters (different sticks can be increased by a different length), but in total by at most l centimeters. In particular, it is allowed not to increase the length of any stick. Determine the number of ways to increase the lengths of some sticks so that you can form from them a non-degenerate (that is, having a positive area) triangle. Two ways are considered different, if the length of some stick is increased by different number of centimeters in them.
