You have been given the timestamps of people entering and exiting a room. Now your job is to determine how the virus will spread. Hurry up, time is of the essence! There are $N$ people in this scenario, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Every day, the $i$th person enters and exits the room at time $s_ i$ and $t_ i$ respectively. At the beginning of the $1$st day, there are $C$ people infected with the virus, whose indices will be given in the input. When an infected person comes into contact with an uninfected person, the uninfected person will become infected at the start of the next day. Hence, they can only start spreading the infection from the next day onward. An infected person will always remain infected. Two people are in contact with each other if they are in the room at the same time. This includes cases where one person leaves and another person enters at the exact same time. Also, if a person enters and exits the room at the same time ($s_ i$ = $t_ i$), they are considered to be in contact with everyone in the room at that time. Due to safe-distancing requirements, no more than $50$ people can be in the room at one time. Your job is to print the indices of the people who will be infected after $D$ days. This includes people who came into contact with an infected person on the $D$th day but will only become infected at the start of the $",
