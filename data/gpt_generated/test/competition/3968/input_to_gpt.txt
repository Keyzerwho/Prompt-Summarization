Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample. Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed. Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time. Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers. 
tl;dr: There are n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks.  Block is called internal if all its neighbors has each side adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation you can destroy all boundary blocks. Count how many operations you will take to destroy all towers. 

At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

A deadly virus is sweeping across the globe! You are part of an elite group of programmers tasked with tracking the spread of the virus. You have been given the timestamps of people entering and exiting a room. Now your job is to determine how the virus will spread. Hurry up, time is of the essence! There are $N$ people in this scenario, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Every day, the $i$th person enters and exits the room at time $s_ i$ and $t_ i$ respectively. At the beginning of the $1$st day, there are $C$ people infected with the virus, whose indices will be given in the input. When an infected person comes into contact with an uninfected person, the uninfected person will become infected at the start of the next day. Hence, they can only start spreading the infection from the next day onward. An infected person will always remain infected. Two people are in contact with each other if they are in the room at the same time. This includes cases where one person leaves and another person enters at the exact same time. Also, if a person enters and exits the room at the same time ($s_ i$ = $t_ i$), they are considered to be in contact with everyone in the room at that time. Due to safe-distancing requirements, no more than $50$ people can be in the room at one time. Your job is to print the indices of the people who will be infected after $D$ days. This includes people who came into contact with an infected person on the $D$th day but will only become infected at the start of the $D+1$th day. Given below are the visualizations for sample inputs $1$ and $2$.
