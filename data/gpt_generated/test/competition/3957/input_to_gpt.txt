You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.  Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a_1 - x, a_2 - x, ..., a_{n} - x is as small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed. n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 
tl;dr: You are given a total of n coins to form staircase rows where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   The output should be the total number of such rows formed. n>=0 and has the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 

Treeland is a country in which there are n towns connected by n - 1 two-way road such that it's possible to get from any town to any other town.  In Treeland there are 2k universities which are located in different towns.  Recently, the president signed the decree to connect universities by high-speed network.The Ministry of Education understood the decree in its own way and decided that it was enough to connect each university with another one by using a cable. Formally, the decree will be done!  To have the maximum sum in the budget, the Ministry decided to divide universities into pairs so that the total length of the required cable will be maximum. In other words, the total distance between universities in k pairs should be as large as possible.  Help the Ministry to find the maximum total distance. Of course, each university should be present in only one pair. Consider that all roads have the same length which is equal to 1.
