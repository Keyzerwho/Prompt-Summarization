tl;dr: Failed Sort - Bug Fixing #4 Your task is to fix the function to sort all numbers in ascending orde

Numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots n$ (each integer from $1$ to $n$ once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the board and write one integer $\frac{a + b}{2}$ rounded up instead. You should perform the given operation $n - 1$ times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.  For example, if $n = 4$, the following course of action is optimal:  choose $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3, 3]$;  choose $a = 3$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3]$;  choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $2$, and the whiteboard contains $[2]$.  It's easy to see that after $n - 1$ operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.

Screen resolution of Polycarp's monitor is $a \times b$ pixels. Unfortunately, there is one dead pixel at his screen. It has coordinates $(x, y)$ ($0 \le x < a, 0 \le y < b$). You can consider columns of pixels to be numbered from $0$ to $a-1$, and rows   from $0$ to $b-1$. Polycarp wants to open a rectangular window of maximal size, which doesn't contain the dead pixel. The boundaries of the window should be parallel to the sides of the screen. Print the maximal area (in pixels) of a window that doesn't contain the dead pixel inside itself. 
tl;dr: You are given grid of size $a \times b$ and a coordinate $(x, y)$ within that grid.  You need to output the largest area of a rectangle that does not include the coordinate $(x, y)$. The boundaries of the rectangle should be parallel to the sides of the grid. 

Treeland is a country in which there are n towns connected by n - 1 two-way road such that it's possible to get from any town to any other town.  In Treeland there are 2k universities which are located in different towns.  Recently, the president signed the decree to connect universities by high-speed network.The Ministry of Education understood the decree in its own way and decided that it was enough to connect each university with another one by using a cable. Formally, the decree will be done!  To have the maximum sum in the budget, the Ministry decided to divide universities into pairs so that the total length of the required cable will be maximum. In other words, the total distance between universities in k pairs should be as large as possible.  Help the Ministry to find the maximum total distance. Of course, each university should be present in only one pair. Consider that all roads have the same length which is equal to 1.
