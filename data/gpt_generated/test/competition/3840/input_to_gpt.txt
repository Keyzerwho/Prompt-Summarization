Dima is a beginner programmer. During his working process, he regularly has to repeat the following operation again and again: to remove every second element from the array. One day he has been bored with easy solutions of this problem, and he has come up with the following extravagant algorithm. Let's consider that initially array contains n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty. Each step Dima selects a non-empty array cell with the maximum index and moves the number written in it to the nearest empty cell to the left of the selected one. The process continues until all n numbers will appear in the first n cells of the array. For example if n = 4, the array is changing as follows: [Image]  You have to write a program that allows you to determine what number will be in the cell with index x (1   x   n) after Dima's algorithm finishes.

# Story You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee. Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on... But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work. To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in. # Kata Task Given the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted. # 
tl;dr: # Task Given the start and end numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all digits from start number to end number. # 

You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide. We will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good. The angle between vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\operatorname{arccos}(\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\vec{y}|})$, where $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\vec{x}|= \sqrt{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is length of $\vec{x}$. Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.

Two pirates Polycarpus and Vasily play a very interesting game. They have n chests with coins, the chests are numbered with integers from 1 to n. Chest number i has a_{i} coins.  Polycarpus and Vasily move in turns. Polycarpus moves first. During a move a player is allowed to choose a positive integer x (2 x + 1   n) and take a coin from each chest with numbers x, 2 x, 2 x + 1. It may turn out that some chest has no coins, in this case the player doesn't take a coin from this chest. The game finishes when all chests get emptied. Polycarpus isn't a greedy scrooge. Polycarpys is a lazy slob. So he wonders in what minimum number of moves the game can finish. Help Polycarpus, determine the minimum number of moves in which the game can finish. Note that Polycarpus counts not only his moves, he also counts Vasily's moves.
