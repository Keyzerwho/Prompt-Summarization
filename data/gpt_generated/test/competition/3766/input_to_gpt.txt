Chef is good at making pancakes. Generally he gets requests to serve N pancakes at once. He serves them in the form of a stack. A pancake can be treated as a circular disk with some radius. Chef needs to take care that when he places a pancake on the top of the stack the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than 1.  Additionally all radii should be positive integers, and the bottom most pancake should have its radius as 1. Chef wants you to find out in how many ways can he create a stack containing N pancakes. Input First line of the input contains T (T <= 1000) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000) denoting the size of the required stack. Output For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size N can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo 1000000007. 
tl;dr: Find the number of ways in which a stack of circular disk can be arranged in such a way that radius of disk on the top of the stack should not exceed the radius of the largest disk in the stack by more than 1.

Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $\{0,1, ,M-1\}$, for some positive integer $M$. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo $M$. What are the residues modulo $M$ that Ajs cannot obtain with this action

Have you ever played Hanabi  If not, then you've got to try it out! This problem deals with a simplified version of the game. Overall, the game has 25 types of cards (5 distinct colors and 5 distinct values). Borya is holding n cards. The game is somewhat complicated by the fact that everybody sees Borya's cards except for Borya himself. Borya knows which cards he has but he knows nothing about the order they lie in. Note that Borya can have multiple identical cards (and for each of the 25 types of cards he knows exactly how many cards of this type he has). The aim of the other players is to achieve the state when Borya knows the color and number value of each of his cards. For that, other players can give him hints. The hints can be of two types: color hints and value hints.  A color hint goes like that: a player names some color and points at all the cards of this color.  Similarly goes the value hint. A player names some value and points at all the cards that contain the value. Determine what minimum number of hints the other players should make for Borya to be certain about each card's color and value.
