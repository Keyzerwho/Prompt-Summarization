Given 2 strings, your job is to find out if there is a substring that appears in both strings. You will return true if you find a substring that appears in both strings, or false if you do not. We only care about substrings that are longer than one letter long. #
tl;dr: Given 2 strings, if there is a substring that appears in both strings, return true. Otherwise, return false. We only count substrings that are > 1 in length. Lowercase and uppercase letters are the same. #

There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

Have you ever played Hanabi  If not, then you've got to try it out! This problem deals with a simplified version of the game. Overall, the game has 25 types of cards (5 distinct colors and 5 distinct values). Borya is holding n cards. The game is somewhat complicated by the fact that everybody sees Borya's cards except for Borya himself. Borya knows which cards he has but he knows nothing about the order they lie in. Note that Borya can have multiple identical cards (and for each of the 25 types of cards he knows exactly how many cards of this type he has). The aim of the other players is to achieve the state when Borya knows the color and number value of each of his cards. For that, other players can give him hints. The hints can be of two types: color hints and value hints.  A color hint goes like that: a player names some color and points at all the cards of this color.  Similarly goes the value hint. A player names some value and points at all the cards that contain the value. Determine what minimum number of hints the other players should make for Borya to be certain about each card's color and value.
