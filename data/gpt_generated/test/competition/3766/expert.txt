 You are given n, the number of cards Borya has, and k, the number of cards that had already been used. You are also given the number of cards of each color and value. You are asked to determine the minimum number of hints the other players should make for Borya to be certain about each card's color and value.

-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of Borya's cards. The next line contains the descriptions of n cards. The description of each card consists of exactly two characters. The first character shows the color (overall this position can contain five distinct letters — R, G, B, Y, W). The second character shows the card's value (a digit from 1 to 5). Borya doesn't know exact order of the cards they lie in. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimum number of hints that the other players should make. -----Examples----- Input 2 G3 G3 Output 0 Input 4 G4 R4 R3 B3 Output 2 Input 5 B1 Y1 W1 G1 R1 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample Borya already knows for each card that it is a green three. In the second sample we can show all fours and all red cards. In the third sample you need to make hints about any four colors.
