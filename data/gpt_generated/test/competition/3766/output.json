You know which cards you have but you know nothing about the order they lie in. Note that you can have multiple identical cards (and for each of the 25 types of cards you know exactly how many cards of this type you have). The aim of the other players is to achieve the state when you know the color and number value of each of your cards. For that, other players can give you hints. The hints can be of two types: color hints and value hints. A color hint goes like that: a player names some color and points at all the cards of this color. Similarly goes the value hint. A player names some value and points at all the cards that contain the value. Determine what minimum number of hints the other players should make for you to be certain about each card's color and value. ",
