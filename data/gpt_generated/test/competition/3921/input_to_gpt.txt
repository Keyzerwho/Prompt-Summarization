For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000. 
tl;dr: Given a number, determine how many positive integers less than or equal to the number are odd but not prime. Assume it is an integer between 1 and 10000. 

Complete the solution so that it takes the object (JavaScript/CoffeeScript) or hash (ruby) passed in and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs.  The format should be "KEY = VALUE". Each key/value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair. **

You are given a non-empty string s consisting of lowercase English letters. You have to pick exactly one non-empty substring of s and shift all its letters 'z' $\rightarrow$ 'y' $\rightarrow$ 'x' $\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow$ 'b' $\rightarrow$ 'a' $\rightarrow$ 'z'. In other words, each character is replaced with the previous character of English alphabet and 'a' is replaced with 'z'. What is the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by performing this shift exactly once

Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are good. Now she is interested in good sequences. A sequence x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:  The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. x_{i} < x_{i} + 1 for each i (1   i   k - 1).  No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. gcd(x_{i}, x_{i} + 1) > 1 for each i (1   i   k - 1) (where gcd(p, q) denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers p and q).  All elements of the sequence are good integers.  Find the length of the longest good sequence.
