It is known that there are k fish species in the polar ocean, numbered from 1 to k. They are sorted by non-decreasing order of their weight, which is a positive number. Let the weight of the i-th type of fish be w_{i}, then 0 < w_1   w_2   ...   w_{k} holds. Polar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish, and they are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish he/she's caught. Given the type of the fish they've caught, determine whether it is possible that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than Bob's. In other words, does there exist a sequence of weights w_{i} (not necessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight

Squirrel Liss is interested in sequences. She also has preferences of integers. She thinks n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are good. Now she is interested in good sequences. A sequence x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} is called good if it satisfies the following three conditions:  The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e. x_{i} < x_{i} + 1 for each i (1   i   k - 1).  No two adjacent elements are coprime, i.e. gcd(x_{i}, x_{i} + 1) > 1 for each i (1   i   k - 1) (where gcd(p, q) denotes the greatest common divisor of the integers p and q).  All elements of the sequence are good integers.  Find the length of the longest good sequence.
