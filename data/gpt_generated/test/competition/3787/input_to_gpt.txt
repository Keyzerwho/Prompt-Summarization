There are $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. For the one move you can choose any even value $c$ and divide by two all elements that equal $c$. For example, if $a=[6,8,12,6,3,12]$ and you choose $c=6$, and $a$ is transformed into $a=[3,8,12,3,3,12]$ after the move. You need to find the minimal number of moves for transforming $a$ to an array of only odd integers (each element shouldn't be divisible by $2$).

Your work is to write a method that takes a value and an index, and returns the value with the bit at given index flipped. The bits are numbered from the least significant bit (index 1).

The Little Elephant has an integer a, written in the binary notation. He wants to write this number on a piece of paper. To make sure that the number a fits on the piece of paper, the Little Elephant ought to delete exactly one any digit from number a in the binary record. At that a new number appears. It consists of the remaining binary digits, written in the corresponding order (possible, with leading zeroes). The Little Elephant wants the number he is going to write on the paper to be as large as possible. Help him find the maximum number that he can obtain after deleting exactly one binary digit and print it in the binary notation. 
tl;dr: Print the maximum number that can be obtained after removing one digit from the given binay number.  

Determine if there exists a sequence obtained by permuting 1,2,...,N that satisfies the following conditions:  - The length of its longest increasing subsequence is A.  - The length of its longest decreasing subsequence is B. If it exists, construct one such sequence. -----Notes----- A subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence that can be obtained by extracting some of the elements in P without changing the order. A longest increasing subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence with the maximum length among the subsequences of P that are monotonically increasing. Similarly, a longest decreasing subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence with the maximum length among the subsequences of P that are monotonically decreasing. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N,A,B \leq 3\times 10^5  - All input values are integers.
