Check if given chord is minor or major. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ There is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music. notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] Note that e. g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1.  
tl;dr: Given a string, determine if given string is minor or major or not a chord. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] 

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1. As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero. For example: ```python monkeyCount(10) # --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] monkeyCount(1) # --> [1] ``
tl;dr: Given the number n, populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero. 

Determine if there exists a sequence obtained by permuting 1,2,...,N that satisfies the following conditions:  - The length of its longest increasing subsequence is A.  - The length of its longest decreasing subsequence is B. If it exists, construct one such sequence. -----Notes----- A subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence that can be obtained by extracting some of the elements in P without changing the order. A longest increasing subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence with the maximum length among the subsequences of P that are monotonically increasing. Similarly, a longest decreasing subsequence of a sequence P is a sequence with the maximum length among the subsequences of P that are monotonically decreasing. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N,A,B \leq 3\times 10^5  - All input values are integers.
