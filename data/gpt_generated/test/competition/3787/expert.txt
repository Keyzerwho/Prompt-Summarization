 Determine if there exists a sequence obtained by permuting 1,2,...,N that satisfies the following conditions: - The length of its longest increasing subsequence is A. - The length of its longest decreasing subsequence is B. If it exists, construct one such sequence. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A B -----Output----- If there are no sequences that satisfy the conditions, print -1. Otherwise, print N integers. The i-th integer should be the i-th element of the sequence that you constructed. -----Sample Input----- 5 3 2 -----Sample Output----- 2 4 1 5 3 One longest increasing subsequence of this sequence is {2,4,5}, and one longest decreasing subsequence of it is {4,3}.
