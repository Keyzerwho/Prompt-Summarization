Given an array of integers. Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. If the input array is empty or null, return an empty array. #

Catherine received an array of integers as a gift for March 8. Eventually she grew bored with it, and she started calculated various useless characteristics for it. She succeeded to do it for each one she came up with. But when she came up with another one   xor of all pairwise sums of elements in the array, she realized that she couldn't compute it for a very large array, thus she asked for your help. Can you do it  Formally, you need to compute $$ (a_1 + a_2) \oplus (a_1 + a_3) \oplus \ldots \oplus (a_1 + a_n) \\ \oplus (a_2 + a_3) \oplus \ldots \oplus (a_2 + a_n) \\ \ldots \\ \oplus (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\ $$ Here $x \oplus y$ is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. $x$ ^ $y$ in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of integers. You need to compute the bitwise XOR of all pariwise sums. 

# Invalid Login - Bug Fixing #11 Oh NO! Timmy has moved divisions... but now he's in the field of security. Timmy, being the top coder he is, has allowed some bad code through. You must help Timmy and filter out any injected code! ## Task Your task is simple, search the password string for any injected code (Injected code is any thing that would be used to exploit flaws in the current code, so basically anything that contains `||` or `//`) if you find any you must return `"Wrong username or password!"` because no one likes someone trying to cheat their way in! ## Preloaded You will be given a preloaded class called `Database` with a method `login` this takes two parameters `username` and `password`. This is a generic login function which will check the database for the user it will return either `'Successfully Logged in!'` if it passes the test or `'Wrong username or password!'` if either the password is wrong or username does not exist. ## Usage ```python database = Database() database.login('Timmy', 'password') ``

You have number a, whose decimal representation quite luckily contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9. Rearrange the digits in its decimal representation so that the resulting number will be divisible by 7. Number a doesn't contain any leading zeroes and contains digits 1, 6, 8, 9 (it also can contain another digits). The resulting number also mustn't contain any leading zeroes.
