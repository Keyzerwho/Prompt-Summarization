Allen is hosting a formal dinner party. $2n$ people come to the event in $n$ pairs (couples). After a night of fun, Allen wants to line everyone up for a final picture. The $2n$ people line up, but Allen doesn't like the ordering. Allen prefers if each pair occupies adjacent positions in the line, as this makes the picture more aesthetic. Help Allen find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions he must perform to make it so that each couple occupies adjacent positions in the line. 
tl;dr: You have to line up $2n$ number of different items which are in $n$ pairs. Find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions which must be performed to make it so that each item pair occupies adjacent positions in the line. 

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones. Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap. 
tl;dr: For a given stone heap, you and your friend can remove 1 to 3 stones in one step.You have to take first and the one who removes the last stone will be the winner.Determine whether you are the winner or not. 

Masha and Grisha like studying sets of positive integers. One day Grisha has written a set A containing n different integers a_{i} on a blackboard. Now he asks Masha to create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different. Both Masha and Grisha don't like big numbers, so all numbers in A are from 1 to 10^6, and all numbers in B must also be in the same range. Help Masha to create the set B that satisfies Grisha's requirement. 
tl;dr: Set A containing n positive different integers a_{i} are given.  Create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different.  All numbers in A and B are from 1 to 10^6. 

The new camp by widely-known over the country Spring Programming Camp is going to start soon. Hence, all the team of friendly curators and teachers started composing the camp's schedule. After some continuous discussion, they came up with a schedule $s$, which can be represented as a binary string, in which the $i$-th symbol is '1' if students will write the contest in the $i$-th day and '0' if they will have a day off. At the last moment Gleb said that the camp will be the most productive if it runs with the schedule $t$ (which can be described in the same format as schedule $s$). Since the number of days in the current may be different from number of days in schedule $t$, Gleb required that the camp's schedule must be altered so that the number of occurrences of $t$ in it as a substring is maximum possible. At the same time, the number of contest days and days off shouldn't change, only their order may change. Could you rearrange the schedule in the best possible way
