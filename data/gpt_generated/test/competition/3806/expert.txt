 You are given a polygon on a plane. The polygon is not necessarily convex. The polygon is tied to a point P which lies outside the polygon. The polygon is switched on. The polygon will make a circle around P. Find the area of the region that will be cleared from snow. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers — the number of vertices of the polygon n ($3 \leq n \leq 100000$), and coordinates of point P. Each of the next n lines contains two integers — coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in the clockwise or counterclockwise order. It is guaranteed that no three consecutive vertices lie on a common straight line. All the numbers in the input are integers that do not exceed 1 000 000 in their absolute value. -----Output----- Print a single real value number — the area of the region that will be cleared. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.  Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 0 0 1 -1 2 1 2 Output 12.566370614359172464 Input 4 1 -1 0 0 1 2 2 0 1 1 Output 21.991148575128551812 -----Note----- In the first sample snow will be removed from that area:  $0$
