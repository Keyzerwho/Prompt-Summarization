The "BerCorp" company has got n employees. These employees can use m approved official languages for the formal correspondence. The languages are numbered with integers from 1 to m. For each employee we have the list of languages, which he knows. This list could be empty, i. e. an employee may know no official languages. But the employees are willing to learn any number of official languages, as long as the company pays their lessons. A study course in one language for one employee costs 1 berdollar. Find the minimum sum of money the company needs to spend so as any employee could correspond to any other one (their correspondence can be indirect, i. e. other employees can help out translating). 
tl;dr: You are given n sets which are a subset of the set of natural numbers in the range 1 to m. You can add a single number to any one set at the cost 1. Find the minimum total cost such that for every pair of sets the union is not a null set. 

Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path. Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine. Peter decided to tie his car to point P and now he is wondering what is the area of   the region that will be cleared from snow. Help him.
