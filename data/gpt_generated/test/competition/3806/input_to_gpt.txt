A tree is a graph with n vertices and exactly n - 1 edges; this graph should meet the following condition: there exists exactly one shortest (by number of edges) path between any pair of its vertices. A subtree of a tree T is a tree with both vertices and edges as subsets of vertices and edges of T. You're given a tree with n vertices. Consider its vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. Additionally an integer is written on every vertex of this tree. Initially the integer written on the i-th vertex is equal to v_{i}. In one move you can apply the following operation:  Select the subtree of the given tree that includes the vertex with number 1.  Increase (or decrease) by one all the integers which are written on the vertices of that subtree.  Calculate the minimum number of moves that is required to make all the integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero.

In this kata, you have to define a function named **func** that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - **[output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation]**, but **you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.**

Peter got a new snow blower as a New Year present. Of course, Peter decided to try it immediately. After reading the instructions he realized that it does not work like regular snow blowing machines. In order to make it work, you need to tie it to some point that it does not cover, and then switch it on. As a result it will go along a circle around this point and will remove all the snow from its path. Formally, we assume that Peter's machine is a polygon on a plane. Then, after the machine is switched on, it will make a circle around the point to which Peter tied it (this point lies strictly outside the polygon). That is, each of the points lying within or on the border of the polygon will move along the circular trajectory, with the center of the circle at the point to which Peter tied his machine. Peter decided to tie his car to point P and now he is wondering what is the area of   the region that will be cleared from snow. Help him.
