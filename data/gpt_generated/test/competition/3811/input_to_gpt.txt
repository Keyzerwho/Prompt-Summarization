The sequence of $m$ integers is called the permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $m$ exactly once. The number $m$ is called the length of the permutation. Dreamoon has two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$ of non-zero lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. Now Dreamoon concatenates these two permutations into another sequence $a$ of length $l_1 + l_2$. First $l_1$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_1$ and next $l_2$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_2$.  You are given the sequence $a$, and you need to find two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$. If there are several possible ways to restore them, you should find all of them. (Note that it is also possible that there will be no ways.)

During the research on properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of numbers, Ildar, a famous mathematician, introduced a brand new concept of the weakened common divisor (WCD) of a list of pairs of integers. For a given list of pairs of integers $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, ..., $(a_n, b_n)$ their WCD is arbitrary integer greater than $1$, such that it divides at least one element in each pair. WCD may not exist for some lists. For example, if the list looks like $[(12, 15), (25, 18), (10, 24)]$, then their WCD can be equal to $2$, $3$, $5$ or $6$ (each of these numbers is strictly greater than $1$ and divides at least one number in each pair). You're currently pursuing your PhD degree under Ildar's mentorship, and that's why this problem was delegated to you. Your task is to calculate WCD efficiently.
