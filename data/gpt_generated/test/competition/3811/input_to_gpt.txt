Chef Vivek is good in mathematics and likes solving problems on prime numbers. One day his friend Jatin told him about Victory numbers. Victory number can be defined as a number formed after summing up all the prime numbers till given number n. Now, chef Vivek who is very fond of solving questions on prime numbers got busy in some other tasks. Your task is to help him finding victory number. 
tl;dr: Find sum the sum of all the prime numbers which are less than the given number N. 

Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.   
tl;dr: Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.   

Ms. E.T. came from planet Hex. She has 8 fingers in each hand which makes her count in hexadecimal way. When she meets you, she tells you that she came from 7E light years from the planet Earth. You see she means that it is 126 light years far away and she is telling you the numbers in hexadecimal. Now, you are in trouble to understand what those numbers really mean. Therefore, you have to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimals. 
tl;dr: Write the code to convert the hexadecimal number into its corresponding decimal value. 

During the research on properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of numbers, Ildar, a famous mathematician, introduced a brand new concept of the weakened common divisor (WCD) of a list of pairs of integers. For a given list of pairs of integers $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, ..., $(a_n, b_n)$ their WCD is arbitrary integer greater than $1$, such that it divides at least one element in each pair. WCD may not exist for some lists. For example, if the list looks like $[(12, 15), (25, 18), (10, 24)]$, then their WCD can be equal to $2$, $3$, $5$ or $6$ (each of these numbers is strictly greater than $1$ and divides at least one number in each pair). You're currently pursuing your PhD degree under Ildar's mentorship, and that's why this problem was delegated to you. Your task is to calculate WCD efficiently.
