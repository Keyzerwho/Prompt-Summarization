 Given a list of pairs of integers $(a_1, b_1)$, $(a_2, b_2)$, ..., $(a_n, b_n)$, find their WCD. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 150\,000$) — the number of pairs. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integer values $a_i$, $b_i$ ($2 \le a_i, b_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9$). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the WCD of the set of pairs.  If there are multiple possible answers, output any; if there is no answer, print $-1$. -----Examples----- Input 3 17 18 15 24 12 15 Output 6 Input 2 10 16 7 17 Output -1 Input 5 90 108 45 105 75 40 165 175 33 30 Output 5 -----Note----- In the first example the answer is $6$ since it divides $18$ from the first pair, $24$ from the second and $12$ from the third ones. Note that other valid answers will also be accepted. In the second example there are no integers greater than $1$ satisfying the conditions. In the third example one of the possible answers is $5$. Note that, for example, $15$ is also allowed, but it's not necessary to maximize the output.
