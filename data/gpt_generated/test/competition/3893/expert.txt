 Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers x_1, y_1 ( - 10^6 ≤ x_1, y_1 ≤ 10^6) — the coordinates of your home. The second line contains two integers separated by a space x_2, y_2 ( - 10^6 ≤ x_2, y_2 ≤ 10^6) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at. The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 10^6 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i} ≤ 10^6; |a_{i}| + |b_{i}| > 0) — the coefficients of the line a_{i}x + b_{i}y + c_{i} = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines). -----Output----- Output the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 -1 -1 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 Output 2 Input 1 1 -1 -1 3 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 -3 Output 2 -----Note----- Pictures to the samples are presented below (A is the point representing the house; B is the point representing the university, different blocks are filled with different colors): [Image]  [Image]
