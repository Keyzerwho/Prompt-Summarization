Stuart is obsessed to numbers. He like all type of numbers in fact he is having a great collection of numbers in his room. His collection includes N different large numbers. But today he is searching for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X. Numbers are large so he can t do the task on his own. Help him to find a number having maximum frequency of digit X. 
tl;dr: Write a code to search for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X in given different numbers.  

Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input. 
tl;dr: Your task is to write a function get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) which returns a dictionary {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} 

In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible. The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Crazy Town is a plane on which there are n infinite line roads. Each road is defined by the equation a_{i}x + b_{i}y + c_{i} = 0, where a_{i} and b_{i} are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect. Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step). Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.
