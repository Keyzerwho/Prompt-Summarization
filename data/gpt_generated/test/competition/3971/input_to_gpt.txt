Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom  note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.  Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note. 
tl;dr: Given two strings a and b return true if a can be constructed from string charecters in b else false Each letter in the b string can only be used once in your a string. 

You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $A$, $B$ and $C$.  Find the number of different groups of three integers ($a$, $b$, $c$) such that $1\leq a\leq b\leq c$ and parallelepiped $A\times B\times C$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $a\times b\times c$. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction. For example, parallelepiped $1\times 5\times 6$ can be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 3\times 5$, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 2\times 3$.

Alex doesn't like boredom. That's why whenever he gets bored, he comes up with games. One long winter evening he came up with a game and decided to play it. Given a sequence a consisting of n integers. The player can make several steps. In a single step he can choose an element of the sequence (let's denote it a_{k}) and delete it, at that all elements equal to a_{k} + 1 and a_{k} - 1 also must be deleted from the sequence. That step brings a_{k} points to the player.  Alex is a perfectionist, so he decided to get as many points as possible. Help him.
