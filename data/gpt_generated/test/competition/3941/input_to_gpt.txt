You have an array A of size N containing only positive numbers. You have to output the maximum possible value of A[i]%A[j] where 1<=i,j<=N.  
tl;dr: Find maximum possible value of A[i]%A[j] where 1<=i,j<=N for a given array A of size N containing positive numbers.  

We have three stones at points (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) on a two-dimensional plane. These three stones are said to form an L when they satisfy the following conditions:  - Each of the stones is at integer coordinates.  - Each of the stones is adjacent to another stone. (That is, for each stone, there is another stone whose distance from that stone is 1.)  - The three stones do not lie on the same line. Particularly, the initial arrangement of the stone - (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) - forms an L. You can do the following operation any number of times: choose one of the stones and move it to any position. However, after each operation, the stones must form an L. You want to do as few operations as possible to put stones at points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy). How many operations do you need to do this  It is guaranteed that the desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L. Under this condition, it is always possible to achieve the objective with a finite number of operations. You will be given T cases of this problem. Solve each of them. -----Notes----- We assume that the three stones are indistinguishable. For example, the stone that is initially at point (0,0) may be at any of the points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) in the end. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq T \leq 10^3  - |ax|,|ay|,|bx|,|by|,|cx|,|cy| \leq 10^9  - The desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L.

Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.  Program is very simple, Given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers. 
tl;dr: Write a program to add given two integers A and B. 

Moriarty has trapped n people in n distinct rooms in a hotel. Some rooms are locked, others are unlocked. But, there is a condition that the people in the hotel can only escape when all the doors are unlocked at the same time. There are m switches. Each switch control doors of some rooms, but each door is controlled by exactly two switches. You are given the initial configuration of the doors. Toggling any switch, that is, turning it ON when it is OFF, or turning it OFF when it is ON, toggles the condition of the doors that this switch controls. Say, we toggled switch 1, which was connected to room 1, 2 and 3 which were respectively locked, unlocked and unlocked. Then, after toggling the switch, they become unlocked, locked and locked. You need to tell Sherlock, if there exists a way to unlock all doors at the same time.
