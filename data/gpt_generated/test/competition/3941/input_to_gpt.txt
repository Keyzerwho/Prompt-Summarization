You are given an array $a_1, a_2 \dots a_n$. Calculate the number of tuples $(i, j, k, l)$ such that:   $1 \le i < j < k < l \le n$;  $a_i = a_k$ and $a_j = a_l$;

An element in an array is dominant if it is greater than all elements to its right. You will be given an array and your task will be to return a list of all dominant elements. For example: ```Haskell solve([1,21,4,7,5]) = [21,7,5] because 21, 7 and 5 are greater than elments to their right.  solve([5,4,3,2,1]) = [5,4,3,2,1] Notice that the last element is always included. ``` More examples in the test cases. Good luck

Moriarty has trapped n people in n distinct rooms in a hotel. Some rooms are locked, others are unlocked. But, there is a condition that the people in the hotel can only escape when all the doors are unlocked at the same time. There are m switches. Each switch control doors of some rooms, but each door is controlled by exactly two switches. You are given the initial configuration of the doors. Toggling any switch, that is, turning it ON when it is OFF, or turning it OFF when it is ON, toggles the condition of the doors that this switch controls. Say, we toggled switch 1, which was connected to room 1, 2 and 3 which were respectively locked, unlocked and unlocked. Then, after toggling the switch, they become unlocked, locked and locked. You need to tell Sherlock, if there exists a way to unlock all doors at the same time.
