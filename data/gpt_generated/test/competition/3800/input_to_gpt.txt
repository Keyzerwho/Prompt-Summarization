Lately, Mr. Chanek frequently plays the game Arena of Greed. As the name implies, the game's goal is to find the greediest of them all, who will then be crowned king of Compfestnesia. The game is played by two people taking turns, where Mr. Chanek takes the first turn. Initially, there is a treasure chest containing $N$ gold coins. The game ends if there are no more gold coins in the chest. In each turn, the players can make one of the following moves:  Take one gold coin from the chest.  Take half of the gold coins on the chest. This move is only available if the number of coins in the chest is even.  Both players will try to maximize the number of coins they have. Mr. Chanek asks your help to find the maximum number of coins he can get at the end of the game if both he and the opponent plays optimally.

Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path. You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.

In this Kata, we are going to determine if the count of each of the characters in a string can be equal if we remove a single character from that string. For example: ``` solve('abba') = false -- if we remove any character, the count of each character will not be equal. solve('abbba') = true -- if we remove one b, the count of each character becomes 2. solve('aaaa') = true -- if we remove one character, the remaining characters have same count. solve('wwwf') = true -- if we remove f, the remaining letters have same count. ``` More examples in the test cases. Empty string is not tested. Good luck
tl;dr: Determine if the count of each of the characters in a string can be equal if a single character is removed from that string. 

You have a string of decimal digits s. Let's define b_{ij} = s_{i} s_{j}. Find in matrix b the number of such rectangles that the sum b_{ij} for all cells (i, j) that are the elements of the rectangle equals a in each rectangle. A rectangle in a matrix is a group of four integers (x, y, z, t) (x   y, z   t). The elements of the rectangle are all cells (i, j) such that x   i   y, z   j   t.
