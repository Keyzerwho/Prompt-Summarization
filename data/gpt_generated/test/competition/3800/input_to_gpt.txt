Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him  Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.  
tl;dr: Given a two dimensional metrix of Latin letters, determine if the word "spoon" (case insensitive) appears in the matrix. 

=====Problem Statement===== ABCXYZ company has up to 100 employees. The company decides to create a unique identification number (UID) for each of its employees. The company has assigned you the task of validating all the randomly generated UIDs. A valid UID must follow the rules below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits (0-9). It should only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z & 0-9). No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid UID. 
tl;dr: =====Problem Statement===== You are given a string A valid string must follow the conditions below: It must contain at least 2 uppercase English alphabet characters. It must contain at least 3 digits 0 to 9. It should only contain alphanumeric characters a-z, A-Z & 0-9. No character should repeat. There must be exactly 10 characters in a valid string. 

You have a string of decimal digits s. Let's define b_{ij} = s_{i} s_{j}. Find in matrix b the number of such rectangles that the sum b_{ij} for all cells (i, j) that are the elements of the rectangle equals a in each rectangle. A rectangle in a matrix is a group of four integers (x, y, z, t) (x   y, z   t). The elements of the rectangle are all cells (i, j) such that x   i   y, z   j   t.
