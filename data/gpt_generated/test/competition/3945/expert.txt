 Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests with an array/list/vector of integers and the expected number n of smallest elements to return. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 1000$) — the number of streets going in the Eastern direction and the number of the streets going in Southern direction. Each of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ integers $a_{i,1}$, $a_{i,2}$, ..., $a_{i,m}$ ($1 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^9$). The integer $a_{i,j}$, located on $j$-th position in the $i$-th line denotes the height of the skyscraper at the intersection of the $i$-th Eastern street and $j$-th Southern direction. -----Output----- Print $n$ lines containing $m$ integers each. The integer $x_{i,j}$, located on $j$-th position inside the $i$-th line is an answer for the problem at the intersection of $i$-th Eastern street and $j$-th Southern street. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 2 Output 2 2 2  2 2 2  Input 2 2 1 2 3 4 Output 2 3  3 2  -----Note----- In the first example, it's not possible to decrease the maximum used height for the problem at any intersection, hence we don't have to change any heights. In the second example, the answers are as follows:   For the intersection of the first line and the first column [Image] For the intersection of the first line and the second column [Image] For the intersection of the second line and the first column [Image] For the intersection of the second line and the second column [Image]
