You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number. Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.  Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order. 
tl;dr: You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number in a pair. A chain if formed when a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Find the length of longest chain which can be formed.  

There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as "u", and can be written as "oo". For this reason, two words "ulyana" and "oolyana" denote the same name. The second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both "h" and "kh" to write it. For example, the words "mihail" and "mikhail" denote the same name. There are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account  Formally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements "u" [Image] "oo" and "h" [Image] "kh", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements. For example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  "koouper" and "kuooper". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: "koouper" $\rightarrow$ "kuuper" and "kuooper" $\rightarrow$ "kuuper".  "khun" and "kkkhoon". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: "khun" $\rightarrow$ "khoon" and "kkkhoon" $\rightarrow$ "kkhoon" $\rightarrow$ "khoon".  For a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.

You are given a string s of length n. Does a tree with n vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., n.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., n-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - If the i-th character in s is 1, we can have a connected component of size i by removing one edge from the tree.  - If the i-th character in s is 0, we cannot have a connected component of size i by removing any one edge from the tree. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq n \leq 10^5  - s is a string of length n consisting of 0 and 1.

Dora loves adventures quite a lot. During some journey she encountered an amazing city, which is formed by $n$ streets along the Eastern direction and $m$ streets across the Southern direction. Naturally, this city has $nm$ intersections. At any intersection of $i$-th Eastern street and $j$-th Southern street there is a monumental skyscraper. Dora instantly became curious and decided to explore the heights of the city buildings. When Dora passes through the intersection of the $i$-th Eastern and $j$-th Southern street she examines those two streets. After Dora learns the heights of all the skyscrapers on those two streets she wonders: how one should reassign heights to the skyscrapers on those two streets, so that the maximum height would be as small as possible and the result of comparing the heights of any two skyscrapers on one street wouldn't change. Formally, on every of $nm$ intersections Dora solves an independent problem. She sees $n + m - 1$ skyscrapers and for each of them she knows its real height. Moreover, any two heights can be compared to get a result "greater", "smaller" or "equal". Now Dora wants to select some integer $x$ and assign every skyscraper a height from $1$ to $x$. When assigning heights, Dora wants to preserve the relative order of the skyscrapers in both streets. That is, the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in the current Eastern street shouldn't change and the result of any comparison of heights of two skyscrapers in current Southern street shouldn't change as well. Note that skyscrapers located on the Southern street are not compared with skyscrapers located on the Eastern street only. However, the skyscraper located at the streets intersection can be compared with both Southern and Eastern skyscrapers. For every intersection Dora wants to independently calculate the minimum possible $x$. For example, if the intersection and the two streets corresponding to it look as follows: [Image]  Then it is optimal to replace the heights of the skyscrapers as follows (note that all comparisons "less", "equal", "greater" inside the Eastern street and inside the Southern street are preserved) [Image]  The largest used number is $5$, hence the answer for this intersection would be $5$. Help Dora to compute the answers for each intersection.
