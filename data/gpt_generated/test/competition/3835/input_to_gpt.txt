Given an integer N, Chef wants to find the smallest positive integer M such that the bitwise XOR of M and M+1 is N. If no such M exists output -1. 
tl;dr: Find the smallest positive integer M such that the bitwise XOR of M and M+1 is equal to given integer N. If no such M exists output -1. 

You'll be given a string, and have to return the total of all the unicode characters as an int. Should be able to handle any characters sent at it.  examples: uniTotal("a") == 97 uniTotal("aaa") == 29

You have unweighted tree of $n$ vertices. You have to assign a positive weight to each edge so that the following condition would hold:   For every two different leaves $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ of this tree, bitwise XOR of weights of all edges on the simple path between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ has to be equal to $0$.  Note that you can put very large positive integers (like $10^{(10^{10})}$). It's guaranteed that such assignment always exists under given constraints. Now let's define $f$ as the number of distinct weights in assignment.  [Image] In this example, assignment is valid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between every pair of leaves is $0$. $f$ value is $2$ here, because there are $2$ distinct edge weights($4$ and $5$). [Image] In this example, assignment is invalid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between vertex $1$ and vertex $6$ ($3, 4, 5, 4$) is not $0$.  What are the minimum and the maximum possible values of $f$ for the given tree  Find and print both.

Sasha grew up and went to first grade. To celebrate this event her mother bought her a multiplication table $M$ with $n$ rows and $n$ columns such that $M_{ij}=a_i \cdot a_j$ where $a_1, \dots, a_n$ is some sequence of positive integers. Of course, the girl decided to take it to school with her. But while she was having lunch, hooligan Grisha erased numbers on the main diagonal and threw away the array $a_1, \dots, a_n$. Help Sasha restore the array!
