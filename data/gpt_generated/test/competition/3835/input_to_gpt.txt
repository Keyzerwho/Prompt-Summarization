Let's say take 2 strings, A and B, and define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings. For example, the similarity of strings `abc` and `abd` is 2, while the similarity of strings `aaa` and `aaab` is 3. write a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string S with each of it's **suffixes**. ```python string_suffix('ababaa') => returns 11 string_suffix('abc') => returns 3 ``` Explanation: In the first case, the suffixes of the string are `ababaa`, `babaa`, `abaa`, `baa`, `aa` and `a`. The similarities of each of these strings with the string `ababaa` are 6,0,3,0,1,1 respectively. Thus the answer is 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11. For the second case, the answer is simply 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. Note : Each string will have at least one character - no need to check for empty strings :
tl;dr: Write a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string with each of its suffixes. 

In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks. 

Sasha grew up and went to first grade. To celebrate this event her mother bought her a multiplication table $M$ with $n$ rows and $n$ columns such that $M_{ij}=a_i \cdot a_j$ where $a_1, \dots, a_n$ is some sequence of positive integers. Of course, the girl decided to take it to school with her. But while she was having lunch, hooligan Grisha erased numbers on the main diagonal and threw away the array $a_1, \dots, a_n$. Help Sasha restore the array!
