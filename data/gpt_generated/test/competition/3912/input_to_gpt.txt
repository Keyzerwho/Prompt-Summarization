# Task  Vanya gets bored one day and decides to enumerate a large pile of rocks. He first counts the rocks and finds out that he has `n` rocks in the pile, then he goes to the store to buy labels for enumeration.     Each of the labels is a digit from 0 to 9 and each of the `n` rocks should be assigned a unique number from `1` to `n`.  If each label costs `$1`, how much money will Vanya spend on this project  # Input/Output  - `[input]` integer `n`   The number of rocks in the pile.   `1     n     10^9`  - `[output]` an integer   the cost of the enumeration.    #

This challenge is based on [the kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/n-smallest-elements-in-original-order) by GiacomoSorbi. Before doing this one it is advisable to complete the non-performance version first. ___ # Task You will be given an array of random integers and a number `n`. You have to extract `n` smallest integers out of it **preserving the original order**. # 
tl;dr: # Task You will be given an array of random integers and a number n. You have to extract n smallest integers out of it. The original order need to be preserved. # 

Igor the analyst has adopted n little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. Igor wants to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. He wants to make sure that all n pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area   [Image] Illustration to the first example.

Kolya has a string s of length n consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits. He wants to rearrange the symbols in s and cut it into the minimum number of parts so that each part is a palindrome and all parts have the same lengths. A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. Your task is to help Kolya and determine the minimum number of palindromes of equal lengths to cut s into, if it is allowed to rearrange letters in s before cuttings.
