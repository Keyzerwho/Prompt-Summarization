You are given a permutation $p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Let's call the number $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) beautiful, if there exists two indices $l, r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$), such that the numbers $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$. For example, let $p = [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$. In this case, the numbers $1, 3, 5, 6$ are beautiful and $2, 4$ are not. It is because:  if $l = 3$ and $r = 3$ we will have a permutation $[1]$ for $m = 1$;  if $l = 3$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 3$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 5$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 6$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$ for $m = 6$;  it is impossible to take some $l$ and $r$, such that $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$ for $m = 2$ and for $m = 4$.  You are given a permutation $p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$. For all $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) determine if it is a beautiful number or not.

Dinesh is very fond of sweets recently his aunt Riya gifted him an array $a$ of sweets of size $N$. The ith sweet is of the type $a[i]$. His mother told him that he can choose one type of sweet in a day and eat at most 2 sweets of that type. Since he has to eat all the sweets as quickly as possible because his cousins are arriving. Find out the minimum number of days in which he can eat all the sweets gifted by his aunt Riya.  
tl;dr: You are given an array $a$ of item of size $N$.Only one type of item can be chosen in a day and purchased at most 2 items of that type.Find minimum number of days in which all items are purchased. 

Kolya has a string s of length n consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits. He wants to rearrange the symbols in s and cut it into the minimum number of parts so that each part is a palindrome and all parts have the same lengths. A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. Your task is to help Kolya and determine the minimum number of palindromes of equal lengths to cut s into, if it is allowed to rearrange letters in s before cuttings.
