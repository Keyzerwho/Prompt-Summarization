Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering. Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number. The numbering starts at 1. The format is `n: string`. Notice the colon and space in between. **

Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order. Iroha is looking for X,Y,Z-Haiku (defined below) in integer sequences. Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku  Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0   x < y < z < w   N) such that all of the following are satisfied:  - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X  - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y  - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Since the answer can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 3   N   40  - 1   X   5  - 1   Y   7  - 1   Z   5

Consider a table G of size n   m such that G(i, j) = GCD(i, j) for all 1   i   n, 1   j   m. GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. You have a sequence of positive integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1   i   n and 1   j   m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = a_{l} for all 1   l   k. Determine if the sequence a occurs in table G.
