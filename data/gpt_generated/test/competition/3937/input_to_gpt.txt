Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for $n$ last days: $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the price of berPhone on the day $i$. Polycarp considers the price on the day $i$ to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if $n=6$ and $a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5]$, then the number of days with a bad price is $3$   these are days $2$ ($a_2=9$), $4$ ($a_4=6$) and $5$ ($a_5=7$). Print the number of days with a bad price. You have to answer $t$ independent data sets. 
tl;dr: you are given a list of of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Now elections are held in Berland and you want to win them. More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you. There are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free. Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \rightarrow {1, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$. Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.

The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for $130$ years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem! 
tl;dr: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  

Consider a table G of size n   m such that G(i, j) = GCD(i, j) for all 1   i   n, 1   j   m. GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. You have a sequence of positive integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1   i   n and 1   j   m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = a_{l} for all 1   l   k. Determine if the sequence a occurs in table G.
