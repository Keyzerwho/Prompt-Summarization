You have a sequence of positive integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}. We say that this sequence occurs in table G if it coincides with consecutive elements in some row, starting from some position. More formally, such numbers 1   i   n and 1   j   m - k + 1 should exist that G(i, j + l - 1) = a_{l} for all 1   l   k. Determine if the sequence a occurs in table G. ",
