In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks. 

# Task Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence. Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.  ## Input * sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.  For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`)

A permutation p of size n is the sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, consisting of n distinct integers, each of them is from 1 to n (1   p_{i}   n). A lucky permutation is such permutation p, that any integer i (1   i   n) meets this condition p_{p}_{i} = n - i + 1. You have integer n. Find some lucky permutation p of size n.

You have a team of N people. For a particular task, you can pick any non-empty subset of people. The cost of having x people for the task is x^{k}.  Output the sum of costs over all non-empty subsets of people.
