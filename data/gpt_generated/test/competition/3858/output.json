Here, we say a set of points S forms a convex polygon when there exists a convex polygon with a positive area that has the same set of vertices as S. All the interior angles of the polygon must be strictly less than 180. For a given set S, let n be the number of the points among the N points that are inside the convex hull of S (including the boundary and vertices). Then, we will define the score of S as 2^{n-|S|}. Compute the scores of all possible sets S that form convex polygons, and find the sum of all those scores. However, since the sum can be extremely large, print the sum modulo 998244353. ",
