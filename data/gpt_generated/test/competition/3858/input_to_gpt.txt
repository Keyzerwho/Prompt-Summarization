Being tired of participating in too many Codeforces rounds, Gildong decided to take some rest in a park. He sat down on a bench, and soon he found two rabbits hopping around. One of the rabbits was taller than the other. He noticed that the two rabbits were hopping towards each other. The positions of the two rabbits can be represented as integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The taller rabbit is currently on position $x$, and the shorter rabbit is currently on position $y$ ($x \lt y$). Every second, each rabbit hops to another position. The taller rabbit hops to the positive direction by $a$, and the shorter rabbit hops to the negative direction by $b$.  [Image]  For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, each rabbit will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both rabbits will be at position $4$. Gildong is now wondering: Will the two rabbits be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the rabbits will be at the same point. 
tl;dr: You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 

You are given two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of the same length. You can perform the following two operations on the string $a$: Swap any two bits at indices $i$ and $j$ respectively ($1 \le i, j \le n$), the cost of this operation is $|i - j|$, that is, the absolute difference between $i$ and $j$.  Select any arbitrary index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and flip (change $0$ to $1$ or $1$ to $0$) the bit at this index. The cost of this operation is $1$.  Find the minimum cost to make the string $a$ equal to $b$. It is not allowed to modify string $b$.

You are given N points (x_i,y_i) located on a two-dimensional plane. Consider a subset S of the N points that forms a convex polygon. Here, we say a set of points S forms a convex polygon when there exists a convex polygon with a positive area that has the same set of vertices as S. All the interior angles of the polygon must be strictly less than 180 . For example, in the figure above, {A,C,E} and {B,D,E} form convex polygons; {A,C,D,E}, {A,B,C,E}, {A,B,C}, {D,E} and {} do not. For a given set S, let n be the number of the points among the N points that are inside the convex hull of S (including the boundary and vertices). Then, we will define the score of S as 2^{n-|S|}. Compute the scores of all possible sets S that form convex polygons, and find the sum of all those scores. However, since the sum can be extremely large, print the sum modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 N 200  - 0 x_i,y_i<10^4 (1 i N)  - If i j, x_i x_j or y_i y_j.  - x_i and y_i are integers.
