You are given n strings s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} consisting of characters 0 and 1. m operations are performed, on each of them you concatenate two existing strings into a new one. On the i-th operation the concatenation s_{a}_{i}s_{b}_{i} is saved into a new string s_{n} + i (the operations are numbered starting from 1). After each operation you need to find the maximum positive integer k such that all possible strings consisting of 0 and 1 of length k (there are 2^{k} such strings) are substrings of the new string. If there is no such k, print 0.

You are given a set of n pens, each of them can be red, blue, green, orange, and violet in color. Count a minimum number of pens that should be taken out from the set so that any two neighboring pens have different colors. Pens are considered to be neighboring if there are no other pens between them.

You are given N points (x_i,y_i) located on a two-dimensional plane. Consider a subset S of the N points that forms a convex polygon. Here, we say a set of points S forms a convex polygon when there exists a convex polygon with a positive area that has the same set of vertices as S. All the interior angles of the polygon must be strictly less than 180 . For example, in the figure above, {A,C,E} and {B,D,E} form convex polygons; {A,C,D,E}, {A,B,C,E}, {A,B,C}, {D,E} and {} do not. For a given set S, let n be the number of the points among the N points that are inside the convex hull of S (including the boundary and vertices). Then, we will define the score of S as 2^{n-|S|}. Compute the scores of all possible sets S that form convex polygons, and find the sum of all those scores. However, since the sum can be extremely large, print the sum modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 N 200  - 0 x_i,y_i<10^4 (1 i N)  - If i j, x_i x_j or y_i y_j.  - x_i and y_i are integers.
