You are given a sequence of $n$ digits $d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}$. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:  each digit is painted either in the color $1$ or in the color $2$;  if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $1$, and then after them all the digits painted in the color $2$, then the resulting sequence of $n$ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).  For example, for the sequence $d=914$ the only valid coloring is $211$ (paint in the color $1$ two last digits, paint in the color $2$ the first digit). But $122$ is not a valid coloring ($9$ concatenated with $14$ is not a non-decreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers numbered from $1$ to $n$. Let's define the $k$-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length $k$ (recall that a subsegment of $a$ of length $k$ is a contiguous part of $a$ containing exactly $k$ elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length $k$ for some value of $k$, then the $k$-amazing number is $-1$. For each $k$ from $1$ to $n$ calculate the $k$-amazing number of the array $a$.

Snuke has an integer sequence, a, of length N. The i-th element of a (1-indexed) is a_{i}. He can perform the following operation any number of times:  - Operation: Choose integers x and y between 1 and N (inclusive), and add a_x to a_y. He would like to perform this operation between 0 and 2N times (inclusive) so that a satisfies the condition below. Show one such sequence of operations. It can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists under the constraints in this problem.  - Condition: a_1 \leq a_2 \leq ...  \leq a_{N} -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 50  - -10^{6} \leq a_i \leq 10^{6}  - All input values are integers.
