Numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots n$ (each integer from $1$ to $n$ once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the board and write one integer $\frac{a + b}{2}$ rounded up instead. You should perform the given operation $n - 1$ times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.  For example, if $n = 4$, the following course of action is optimal:  choose $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3, 3]$;  choose $a = 3$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3]$;  choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $2$, and the whiteboard contains $[2]$.  It's easy to see that after $n - 1$ operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.

Given two strings representing two complex numbers. You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition. 
tl;dr: Write program to return a string representing the multiplication of given two  strings of complex numbers. 

Error Handling is very important in coding and seems to be overlooked or not implemented properly. #Task Your task is to implement a function which takes a string as input and return an object containing the properties vowels and consonants. The vowels property must contain the total count of vowels {a,e,i,o,u}, and the total count of consonants {a,..,z} - {a,e,i,o,u}. Handle invalid input and don't forget to return valid ones. #Input The input is any random string. You must then discern what are vowels and what are consonants and sum for each category their total occurrences in an object. However you could also receive inputs that are not strings. If this happens then you must return an object with a vowels and consonants total of 0 because the input was NOT a string. Refer to the 
tl;dr: Your task is to implement a function which takes a string as input and return an object containing the properties vowels and consonants. 

Snuke has an integer sequence, a, of length N. The i-th element of a (1-indexed) is a_{i}. He can perform the following operation any number of times:  - Operation: Choose integers x and y between 1 and N (inclusive), and add a_x to a_y. He would like to perform this operation between 0 and 2N times (inclusive) so that a satisfies the condition below. Show one such sequence of operations. It can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists under the constraints in this problem.  - Condition: a_1 \leq a_2 \leq ...  \leq a_{N} -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 50  - -10^{6} \leq a_i \leq 10^{6}  - All input values are integers.
