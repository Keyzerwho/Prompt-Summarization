He would like to perform this operation between 0 and 2N times (inclusive) so that a satisfies the condition below. Show one such sequence of operations. It can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists under the constraints in this problem.  - Condition: a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq ...  \\leq a_{N} -----Constraints-----  - 2 \\leq N \\leq 50  - -10^{6} \\leq a_i \\leq 10^{6}  - All input values are integers.
