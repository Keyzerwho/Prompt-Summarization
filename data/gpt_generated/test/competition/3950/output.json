During the $i$-th query some segment $(l_i, r_i)$ $(1 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le n)$ was selected and values of elements on positions from $l_i$ to $r_i$ inclusive got changed to $i$. The order of the queries couldn't be changed and all $q$ queries were applied. It is also known that every position from $1$ to $n$ got covered by at least one segment. \n",
