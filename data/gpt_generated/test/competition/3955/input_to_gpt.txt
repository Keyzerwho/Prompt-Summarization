You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ positive integers. You can use the following operation as many times as you like: select any integer $1 \le k \le n$ and do one of two things:   decrement by one $k$ of the first elements of the array.  decrement by one $k$ of the last elements of the array.  For example, if $n=5$ and $a=[3,2,2,1,4]$, then you can apply one of the following operations to it (not all possible options are listed below):   decrement from the first two elements of the array. After this operation $a=[2, 1, 2, 1, 4]$;  decrement from the last three elements of the array. After this operation $a=[3, 2, 1, 0, 3]$;  decrement from the first five elements of the array. After this operation $a=[2, 1, 1, 0, 3]$;  Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations.

You are given n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. You can perform at most k operations. For each operation you can multiply one of the numbers by x. We want to make [Image] as large as possible, where $1$ denotes the bitwise OR.  Find the maximum possible value of [Image] after performing at most k operations optimally.
