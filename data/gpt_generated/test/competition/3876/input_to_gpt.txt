The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other. Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both  Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others        Explanation Self-Explanator
tl;dr: You are given a string, if it contains the word berhampore , print GCETTB or if it contains serampore print GCETTS. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both, otherwise print others.Ignore the case.   Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others      

The Little Elephant has an integer a, written in the binary notation. He wants to write this number on a piece of paper. To make sure that the number a fits on the piece of paper, the Little Elephant ought to delete exactly one any digit from number a in the binary record. At that a new number appears. It consists of the remaining binary digits, written in the corresponding order (possible, with leading zeroes). The Little Elephant wants the number he is going to write on the paper to be as large as possible. Help him find the maximum number that he can obtain after deleting exactly one binary digit and print it in the binary notation. 
tl;dr: Print the maximum number that can be obtained after removing one digit from the given binay number.  

Let N be an even number. There is a tree with N vertices. The vertices are numbered 1, 2, ..., N. For each i (1 \leq i \leq N - 1), the i-th edge connects Vertex x_i and y_i. Snuke would like to decorate the tree with ribbons, as follows. First, he will divide the N vertices into N / 2 pairs. Here, each vertex must belong to exactly one pair. Then, for each pair (u, v), put a ribbon through all the edges contained in the shortest path between u and v. Snuke is trying to divide the vertices into pairs so that the following condition is satisfied: "for every edge, there is at least one ribbon going through it." How many ways are there to divide the vertices into pairs, satisfying this condition  Find the count modulo 10^9 + 7. Here, two ways to divide the vertices into pairs are considered different when there is a pair that is contained in one of the two ways but not in the other. -----Constraints-----  - N is an even number.  - 2 \leq N \leq 5000  - 1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq N  - The given graph is a tree.
