Let's say take 2 strings, A and B, and define the similarity of the strings to be the length of the longest prefix common to both strings. For example, the similarity of strings `abc` and `abd` is 2, while the similarity of strings `aaa` and `aaab` is 3. write a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string S with each of it's **suffixes**. ```python string_suffix('ababaa') => returns 11 string_suffix('abc') => returns 3 ``` Explanation: In the first case, the suffixes of the string are `ababaa`, `babaa`, `abaa`, `baa`, `aa` and `a`. The similarities of each of these strings with the string `ababaa` are 6,0,3,0,1,1 respectively. Thus the answer is 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11. For the second case, the answer is simply 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. Note : Each string will have at least one character - no need to check for empty strings :
tl;dr: Write a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string with each of its suffixes. 

Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer. For example, the number `417` is `110100001` in binary. Reversing the binary is `100001011` which is `267`. You can assume that the number is not negative
tl;dr: Reverses the bits in a positive integer. 

Give me Chocolate Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices. Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money. Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy   For example,  if prices =[1,2,3,4] and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend. The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= prices[i] <= 109 A chocolate can't be bought multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 4 Explanation she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most. These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10
tl;dr: You are given an array of size n and a limiting number k. Find the maximum count of numbers from array whose sum is not greater than k. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of elements in array and a limiting number. The next line contains n space-separated integers array[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= array[i] <= 109 A number can't be repeated multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum count of array numbers whose sum can't be greater than k. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 

A remote island chain contains n islands, labeled 1 through n. Bidirectional bridges connect the islands to form a simple cycle   a bridge connects islands 1 and 2, islands 2 and 3, and so on, and additionally a bridge connects islands n and 1. The center of each island contains an identical pedestal, and all but one of the islands has a fragile, uniquely colored statue currently held on the pedestal. The remaining island holds only an empty pedestal. The islanders want to rearrange the statues in a new order. To do this, they repeat the following process: First, they choose an island directly adjacent to the island containing an empty pedestal. Then, they painstakingly carry the statue on this island across the adjoining bridge and place it on the empty pedestal. Determine if it is possible for the islanders to arrange the statues in the desired order.
