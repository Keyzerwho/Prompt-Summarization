This is now a little serie :) Funny Dots You will get two Integer n (width) and m (height) and your task is to draw following pattern. Each line is seperated with '\n'. Both integers are equal or greater than 1. No need to check for invalid parameters. e.g.:                                           +---+---+---+             +---+                         | o | o | o | dot(1,1) => | o |          dot(3,2) =>    +---+---+---+                         +---+                         | o | o | o |                                           +---+---+---+  Serie: ASCII Fun ASCII Fun #1: X-Shape ASCII Fun #2: Funny Dots ASCII Fun #3: Puzzle Tiles ASCII Fun #4: Build a pyrami
tl;dr: You will be given two integers and your task is to draw following pattern. 

In this Kata you need to write the method SharedBits that returns true if 2 integers share at least two '1' bits. For simplicity assume that all numbers are positive For example int seven = 7;    //0111 int ten = 10;     //1010 int fifteen = 15; //1111 SharedBits(seven, ten);     //false SharedBits(seven, fifteen); //true SharedBits(ten, fifteen);   //true - seven and ten share only a single '1' (at index 3) - seven and fifteen share 3 bits (at indexes 1, 2, and 3) - ten and fifteen  share 2 bits (at indexes 0 and 2)

A remote island chain contains n islands, labeled 1 through n. Bidirectional bridges connect the islands to form a simple cycle   a bridge connects islands 1 and 2, islands 2 and 3, and so on, and additionally a bridge connects islands n and 1. The center of each island contains an identical pedestal, and all but one of the islands has a fragile, uniquely colored statue currently held on the pedestal. The remaining island holds only an empty pedestal. The islanders want to rearrange the statues in a new order. To do this, they repeat the following process: First, they choose an island directly adjacent to the island containing an empty pedestal. Then, they painstakingly carry the statue on this island across the adjoining bridge and place it on the empty pedestal. Determine if it is possible for the islanders to arrange the statues in the desired order.
