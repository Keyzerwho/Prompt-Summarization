 Given a list of n islands and a list of n bridges, is it possible to move all the statues to the first island. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the total number of islands. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n - 1) — the statue currently placed on the i-th island. If a_{i} = 0, then the island has no statue. It is guaranteed that the a_{i} are distinct. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_{i} (0 ≤ b_{i} ≤ n - 1) — the desired statues of the ith island. Once again, b_{i} = 0 indicates the island desires no statue. It is guaranteed that the b_{i} are distinct. -----Output----- Print "YES" (without quotes) if the rearrangement can be done in the existing network, and "NO" otherwise. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 0 2 2 0 1 Output YES Input 2 1 0 0 1 Output YES Input 4 1 2 3 0 0 3 2 1 Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample, the islanders can first move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2, then move statue 2 from island 3 to island 1, and finally move statue 1 from island 2 to island 3. In the second sample, the islanders can simply move statue 1 from island 1 to island 2. In the third sample, no sequence of movements results in the desired position.
