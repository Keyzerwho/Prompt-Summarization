It's Friday night, and Chuck is bored. He's already run 1,000 miles, stopping only to eat a family sized bag of Heatwave Doritos and a large fistful of M&Ms. He just can't stop thinking about kicking something!  There is only one thing for it, Chuck heads down to his local MMA gym and immediately challenges every fighter there to get in the cage and try and take him down... AT THE SAME TIME!  You are provided an array of strings that represent the cage and Chuck's opponents. Your task, in traditional Chuck style, is to take their heads off!! Throw punches, kicks, headbutts (or more likely - regex or iteration...) but whatever you do, remove their heads. Return the same array of strings, but with the heads ('O') removed and replaced with a space (' '). If the provided array is empty, or is an empty string, return 'Gym is empty'. If you are given an array of numbers, return 'This isn't the gym!!'. FIGHT!! *Original design of this kata was a much more beautiful thing - the test cases illustrate the idea, and the intended output. I am unable to make the actual output go over multiple lines so for now at least you will have to imagine the beauty!
tl;dr: You are provided an array of strings that represent the cage and Chuck's opponents. Your task is to take their heads off!! . Return the same array of strings, but with the heads ('O') removed and replaced with a space (' '). If the provided array is empty, or is an empty string, return 'Gym is empty'. If you are given an array of numbers, return 'This isn't the gym!!'

$Neha$  is given a number $N$. She always looks for special thing , this time she is looking for $Special$ $Number$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Number$. A $Special$ $Number$ is a number whose product of its digits is equal to number itself i.e. $N $, and in this number there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it .Neha have to count the number of $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ . She is not so good in programming , so go and help her. 
tl;dr: You have to find a $Special$ $Number$  and a $Partial$ special number for a number N.Special Number are those product of its digits is equal to number itself and there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it. Print the count of the $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ .  

A k-multiple free set is a set of integers where there is no pair of integers where one is equal to another integer multiplied by k. That is, there are no two integers x and y (x < y) from the set, such that y = x k. You're given a set of n distinct positive integers. Your task is to find the size of it's largest k-multiple free subset.
