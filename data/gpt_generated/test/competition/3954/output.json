Let's introduce notation: $f(a, l, r) = \\sum_{i = l}^{r} a [ i ] ; m(a) = \\operatorname{max}_{1 \\leq l \\leq r \\leq n} f(a, l, r)$ A swap operation is the following sequence of actions:   choose two indexes i, j (i   j);  perform assignments tmp = a[i], a[i] = a[j], a[j] = tmp.  What maximum value of function m(a) can Sereja get if he is allowed to perform at most k swap operations ",
