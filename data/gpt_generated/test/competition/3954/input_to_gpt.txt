There are total N friends went to Chef's Pizza shop. There they bought a pizza. Chef divided the pizza into K equal slices. Now you have to check whether these K pizza slices can be distributed equally among the friends. Also given that every person should get at least one slice. If the above conditions are possible then print "YES" otherwise print "NO". 
tl;dr: You have to divided K equal slices of pizza to distribute among N people. Check whether these K pizza slices can be distributed equally among the N children if every child should get at least one slice. If it's possible then print "YES" otherwise print "NO". 

Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order. Iroha is looking for X,Y,Z-Haiku (defined below) in integer sequences. Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku  Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0   x < y < z < w   N) such that all of the following are satisfied:  - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X  - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y  - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Since the answer can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 3   N   40  - 1   X   5  - 1   Y   7  - 1   Z   5

Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}]. Define its prefix product sequence $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 
tl;dr: Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}].  Let's define its prefix product sequence as $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 

As usual, Sereja has array a, its elements are integers: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]. Let's introduce notation: $f(a, l, r) = \sum_{i = l}^{r} a [ i ] ; m(a) = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq l \leq r \leq n} f(a, l, r)$ A swap operation is the following sequence of actions:   choose two indexes i, j (i   j);  perform assignments tmp = a[i], a[i] = a[j], a[j] = tmp.  What maximum value of function m(a) can Sereja get if he is allowed to perform at most k swap operations
