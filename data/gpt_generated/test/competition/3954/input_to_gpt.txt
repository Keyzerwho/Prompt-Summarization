**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #18 Create a function called that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one. If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that: Every song is played at least once A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.   
tl;dr: You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 

As usual, Sereja has array a, its elements are integers: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n]. Let's introduce notation: $f(a, l, r) = \sum_{i = l}^{r} a [ i ] ; m(a) = \operatorname{max}_{1 \leq l \leq r \leq n} f(a, l, r)$ A swap operation is the following sequence of actions:   choose two indexes i, j (i   j);  perform assignments tmp = a[i], a[i] = a[j], a[j] = tmp.  What maximum value of function m(a) can Sereja get if he is allowed to perform at most k swap operations
