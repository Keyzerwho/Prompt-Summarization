Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} for his birthday. Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a pair of indexes i, j (1   i < j   n), such that an inequality a_{i} > a_{j} holds. Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get. 
tl;dr: You are given a sequence. You can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. You want the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Find the minimum number of inversions you can get. 

In this Kata your task will be to return the count of pairs that have consecutive numbers as follows: ```Haskell pairs([1,2,5,8,-4,-3,7,6,5]) = 3 The pairs are selected as follows [(1,2),(5,8),(-4,-3),(7,6),5] --the first pair is (1,2) and the numbers in the pair are consecutive; Count = 1 --the second pair is (5,8) and are not consecutive --the third pair is (-4,-3), consecutive. Count = 2 --the fourth pair is (7,6), also consecutive. Count = 3.  --the last digit has no pair, so we ignore. ``` More examples in the test cases.  Good luck!

In "Takahashi-ya", a ramen restaurant, basically they have one menu: "ramen", but N kinds of toppings are also offered. When a customer orders a bowl of ramen, for each kind of topping, he/she can choose whether to put it on top of his/her ramen or not. There is no limit on the number of toppings, and it is allowed to have all kinds of toppings or no topping at all. That is, considering the combination of the toppings, 2^N types of ramen can be ordered. Akaki entered Takahashi-ya. She is thinking of ordering some bowls of ramen that satisfy both of the following two conditions:  - Do not order multiple bowls of ramen with the exactly same set of toppings.  - Each of the N kinds of toppings is on two or more bowls of ramen ordered. You are given N and a prime number M. Find the number of the sets of bowls of ramen that satisfy these conditions, disregarding order, modulo M. Since she is in extreme hunger, ordering any number of bowls of ramen is fine. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 3000  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - N is an integer.  - M is a prime number. -----Subscores-----  - 600 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying N   50.
