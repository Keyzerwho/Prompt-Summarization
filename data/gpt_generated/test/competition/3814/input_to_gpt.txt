In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks. 

The factorial of a number, `n!`, is defined for whole numbers as the product of all integers from `1` to `n`.  For example, `5!` is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120` Most factorial implementations use a recursive function to determine the value of `factorial(n)`. However, this blows up the stack for large values of `n` - most systems cannot handle stack depths much greater than 2000 levels. Write an implementation to calculate the factorial of arbitrarily large numbers, *without recursion.* # Rules * `n < 0` should return `nil`/  `None` * `n = 0` should return `1` * `n > 0` should return `n!` # Note Codewars limits the amount of data it will send back and forth, which may introduce a false ceiling for how high of a value of `n` it will accept. All tests use values less than this limit

You are given a set of size $m$ with integer elements between $0$ and $2^{n}-1$ inclusive. Let's build an undirected graph on these integers in the following way: connect two integers $x$ and $y$ with an edge if and only if $x \& y = 0$. Here $\&$ is the bitwise AND operation. Count the number of connected components in that graph.

In "Takahashi-ya", a ramen restaurant, basically they have one menu: "ramen", but N kinds of toppings are also offered. When a customer orders a bowl of ramen, for each kind of topping, he/she can choose whether to put it on top of his/her ramen or not. There is no limit on the number of toppings, and it is allowed to have all kinds of toppings or no topping at all. That is, considering the combination of the toppings, 2^N types of ramen can be ordered. Akaki entered Takahashi-ya. She is thinking of ordering some bowls of ramen that satisfy both of the following two conditions:  - Do not order multiple bowls of ramen with the exactly same set of toppings.  - Each of the N kinds of toppings is on two or more bowls of ramen ordered. You are given N and a prime number M. Find the number of the sets of bowls of ramen that satisfy these conditions, disregarding order, modulo M. Since she is in extreme hunger, ordering any number of bowls of ramen is fine. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 3000  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - N is an integer.  - M is a prime number. -----Subscores-----  - 600 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying N   50.
