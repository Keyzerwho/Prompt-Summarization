 You are given N and a prime number M. Find the number of the sets of bowls of ramen that satisfy these conditions, disregarding order, modulo M. Since she is in extreme hunger, ordering any number of bowls of ramen is fine. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 3000  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - N is an integer.  - M is a prime number. -----Subscores-----  - 600 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying N 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M -----Output----- Print the number of the sets of bowls of ramen that satisfy the conditions, disregarding order, modulo M. -----Sample Input----- 2 1000000007 -----Sample Output----- 2 Let the two kinds of toppings be A and B.
