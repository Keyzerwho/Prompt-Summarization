Richik$Richik$ has just completed his engineering and has got a job in one of the firms at Sabrina$Sabrina$ which is ranked among the top seven islands in the world in terms of the pay scale.  Since Richik$Richik$ has to travel a lot to reach the firm, the owner assigns him a number X$X$, and asks him to come to work only on the day which is a multiple of X$X$. Richik joins the firm on 1-st day but starts working from X-th day. Richik$Richik$ is paid exactly the same amount in Dollars as the day number. For example, if Richik$Richik$ has been assigned X=3$X = 3$, then he will be paid 3$3$ dollars and 6$6$ dollars on the 3rd$3rd$ and 6th$6th$ day on which he comes for work.  On N th$N-th$ day, the owner calls up Richik$Richik$ and asks him not to come to his firm anymore. Hence Richik$Richik$ demands his salary of all his working days together. Since it will take a lot of time to add, Richik$Richik$ asks help from people around him, let's see if you can help him out.  
tl;dr: You are given a number X and limit N. You need to output the sum of multiples of X upto N. 

You are given two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of the same length. You can perform the following two operations on the string $a$: Swap any two bits at indices $i$ and $j$ respectively ($1 \le i, j \le n$), the cost of this operation is $|i - j|$, that is, the absolute difference between $i$ and $j$.  Select any arbitrary index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and flip (change $0$ to $1$ or $1$ to $0$) the bit at this index. The cost of this operation is $1$.  Find the minimum cost to make the string $a$ equal to $b$. It is not allowed to modify string $b$.

Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path. You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.

Astronaut Natasha arrived on Mars. She knows that the Martians are very poor aliens. To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars. There are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination. Martians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet. Determine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy. Natasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.
