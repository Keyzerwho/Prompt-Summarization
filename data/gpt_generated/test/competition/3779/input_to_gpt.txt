## A square of squares You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks! However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain  Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a _perfect square_. ## Task Given an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number): > In mathematics, a __square number__ or __perfect square__ is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. The tests will _always_ use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages. ### 
tl;dr: Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number.

Astronaut Natasha arrived on Mars. She knows that the Martians are very poor aliens. To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars. There are $n$ banknote denominations on Mars: the value of $i$-th banknote is $a_i$. Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination. Martians have $k$ fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base $k$. In addition, the Martians consider the digit $d$ (in the number system with base $k$) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base $k$ is $d$, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet. Determine for which values $d$ Natasha can make the Martians happy. Natasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.
