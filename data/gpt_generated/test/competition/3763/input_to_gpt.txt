There are $n$ athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete   the athlete number $i$ has the strength $s_i$. You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team. You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams $A$ and $B$ so that the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ is as small as possible, where $\max(A)$ is the maximum strength of an athlete from team $A$, and $\min(B)$ is the minimum strength of an athlete from team $B$. For example, if $n=5$ and the strength of the athletes is $s=[3, 1, 2, 6, 4]$, then one of the possible split into teams is:   first team: $A = [1, 2, 4]$,  second team: $B = [3, 6]$.  In this case, the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ will be equal to $|4-3|=1$. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams. Print the minimum value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$. 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers. You want to split the integers into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list $A$ to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list $B$. 

Write a function that checks if all the letters in the second string are present in the first one at least once, regardless of how many times they appear: ``` ["ab", "aaa"]    =>  true ["trances", "nectar"]    =>  true ["compadres", "DRAPES"]  =>  true ["parses", "parsecs"]    =>  false ``` Function should not be case sensitive, as indicated in example #2.

Maxim has opened his own restaurant! The restaurant has got a huge table, the table's length is p meters. Maxim has got a dinner party tonight, n guests will come to him. Let's index the guests of Maxim's restaurant from 1 to n. Maxim knows the sizes of all guests that are going to come to him. The i-th guest's size (a_{i}) represents the number of meters the guest is going to take up if he sits at the restaurant table. Long before the dinner, the guests line up in a queue in front of the restaurant in some order. Then Maxim lets the guests in, one by one. Maxim stops letting the guests in when there is no place at the restaurant table for another guest in the queue. There is no place at the restaurant table for another guest in the queue, if the sum of sizes of all guests in the restaurant plus the size of this guest from the queue is larger than p. In this case, not to offend the guest who has no place at the table, Maxim doesn't let any other guest in the restaurant, even if one of the following guests in the queue would have fit in at the table. Maxim is now wondering, what is the average number of visitors who have come to the restaurant for all possible n! orders of guests in the queue. Help Maxim, calculate this number.
