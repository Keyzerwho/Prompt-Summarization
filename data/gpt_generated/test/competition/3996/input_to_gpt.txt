Genos recently installed the game Zuma on his phone. In Zuma there exists a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal of the game is to destroy all the gemstones in the line as quickly as possible. In one second, Genos is able to choose exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  Let us remind, that the string (or substring) is called palindrome, if it reads same backwards or forward. In our case this means the color of the first gemstone is equal to the color of the last one, the color of the second gemstone is equal to the color of the next to last and so on. 
tl;dr: You are given a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal is to destroy all the gemstones in the line. In one second, exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones is chosen that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again.  What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  

You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. Find the maximum possible value of $a_{i} \operatorname{mod} a_{j}$ (integer remainder of a_{i} divided by a_{j}), where 1   i, j   n and a_{i}   a_{j}.

In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks. 

As we all know Barney's job is "PLEASE" and he has not much to do at work. That's why he started playing "cups and key". In this game there are three identical cups arranged in a line from left to right. Initially key to Barney's heart is under the middle cup. [Image]  Then at one turn Barney swaps the cup in the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal probability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts n turns and Barney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each turn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start. After n-th turn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key. The girl points to the middle one but Barney was distracted while making turns and doesn't know if the key is under the middle cup. That's why he asked you to tell him the probability that girl guessed right. Number n of game turns can be extremely large, that's why Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k} such that  $n = \prod_{i = 1}^{k} a_{i}$  in other words, n is multiplication of all elements of the given array. Because of precision difficulties, Barney asked you to tell him the answer as an irreducible fraction. In other words you need to find it as a fraction p / q such that $\operatorname{gcd}(p, q) = 1$, where $gcd$ is the greatest common divisor. Since p and q can be extremely large, you only need to find the remainders of dividing each of them by 10^9 + 7. Please note that we want $gcd$ of p and q to be 1, not $gcd$ of their remainders after dividing by 10^9 + 7.
