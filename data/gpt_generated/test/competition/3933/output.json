Assume that the average air temperature for each day is integral. Vasya believes that if the average temperatures over the last n days form an arithmetic progression, where the first term equals to the average temperature on the first day, the second term equals to the average temperature on the second day and so on, then the average temperature of the next (n + 1)-th day will be equal to the next term of the arithmetic progression. Otherwise, according to Vasya's method, the temperature of the (n + 1)-th day will be equal to the temperature of the n-th day. Help Vasya predict the average temperature for tomorrow, i. e. for the (n + 1)-th day. ",
