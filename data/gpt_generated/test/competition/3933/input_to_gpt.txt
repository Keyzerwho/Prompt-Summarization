We have three stones at points (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) on a two-dimensional plane. These three stones are said to form an L when they satisfy the following conditions:  - Each of the stones is at integer coordinates.  - Each of the stones is adjacent to another stone. (That is, for each stone, there is another stone whose distance from that stone is 1.)  - The three stones do not lie on the same line. Particularly, the initial arrangement of the stone - (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) - forms an L. You can do the following operation any number of times: choose one of the stones and move it to any position. However, after each operation, the stones must form an L. You want to do as few operations as possible to put stones at points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy). How many operations do you need to do this  It is guaranteed that the desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L. Under this condition, it is always possible to achieve the objective with a finite number of operations. You will be given T cases of this problem. Solve each of them. -----Notes----- We assume that the three stones are indistinguishable. For example, the stone that is initially at point (0,0) may be at any of the points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) in the end. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq T \leq 10^3  - |ax|,|ay|,|bx|,|by|,|cx|,|cy| \leq 10^9  - The desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L.

Toad Pimple has an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. We say that $y$ is reachable from $x$ if $x<y$ and there exists an integer array $p$ such that $x = p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_k=y$, and $a_{p_i}\, \&\, a_{p_{i+1}} > 0$ for all integers $i$ such that $1 \leq i < k$. Here $\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. You are given $q$ pairs of indices, check reachability for each of them.

You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number. Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.  Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order.

Vasya came up with his own weather forecasting method. He knows the information about the average air temperature for each of the last n days. Assume that the average air temperature for each day is integral. Vasya believes that if the average temperatures over the last n days form an arithmetic progression, where the first term equals to the average temperature on the first day, the second term equals to the average temperature on the second day and so on, then the average temperature of the next (n + 1)-th day will be equal to the next term of the arithmetic progression. Otherwise, according to Vasya's method, the temperature of the (n + 1)-th day will be equal to the temperature of the n-th day. Your task is to help Vasya predict the average temperature for tomorrow, i. e. for the (n + 1)-th day.
