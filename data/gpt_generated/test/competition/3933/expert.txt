 Given the average temperature for each of the last n days, determine whether the average temperature for the next day will be the same as the average temperature for the n-th day or the next term of the arithmetic progression. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of days for which the average air temperature is known. The second line contains a sequence of integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} ( - 1000 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 1000) — where t_{i} is the average temperature in the i-th day. -----Output----- Print the average air temperature in the (n + 1)-th day, which Vasya predicts according to his method. Note that the absolute value of the predicted temperature can exceed 1000. -----Examples----- Input 5 10 5 0 -5 -10 Output -15 Input 4 1 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 5 1 -5 Output -5 Input 2 900 1000 Output 1100 -----Note----- In the first example the sequence of the average temperatures is an arithmetic progression where the first term is 10 and each following terms decreases by 5. So the predicted average temperature for the sixth day is  - 10 - 5 =  - 15. In the second example the sequence of the average temperatures is an arithmetic progression where the first term is 1 and each following terms equals to the previous one. So the predicted average temperature in the fifth day is 1. In the third example the average temperatures do not form an arithmetic progression, so the average temperature of the fourth day equals to the temperature of the third day and equals to  - 5. In the fourth example the sequence of the average temperatures is an arithmetic progression where the first term is 900 and each the following terms increase by 100. So predicted average temperature in the third day is 1000 + 100 = 1100.
