Dreamoon likes sequences very much. So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS:  You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, satisfying the following constraints:  The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$  Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$, where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or (xor). After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo $m$. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, with constraints. The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$   Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$,  where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or.  After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  You need to find the answer modulo $m$. 

Given a permutation $p$ of length $n$, find its subsequence $s_1$, $s_2$, $\ldots$, $s_k$ of length at least $2$ such that:  $|s_1-s_2|+|s_2-s_3|+\ldots+|s_{k-1}-s_k|$ is as big as possible over all subsequences of $p$ with length at least $2$.  Among all such subsequences, choose the one whose length, $k$, is as small as possible.  If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them. A sequence $a$ is a subsequence of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements. A permutation of length $n$ is an array of length $n$ in which every element from $1$ to $n$ occurs exactly once.

You are given an integer m as a product of integers a_1, a_2, ... a_{n} $(m = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} a_{i})$. Your task is to find the number of distinct decompositions of number m into the product of n ordered positive integers. Decomposition into n products, given in the input, must also be considered in the answer. As the answer can be very large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).
