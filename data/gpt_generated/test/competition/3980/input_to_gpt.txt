Write a function named sumDigits which takes a number as input and returns the sum of the absolute value of each of the number's decimal digits.  For example: ```python   sum_digits(10)  # Returns 1   sum_digits(99)  # Returns 18   sum_digits(-32) # Returns 5 ``` Let's assume that all numbers in the input will be integer values

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"] i.e.

**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #16 Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the **first** not repeated character in the entire string. ``` haskell noRepeat "aabbccdde" `shouldBe` 'e' noRepeat "wxyz"      `shouldBe` 'w' noRepeat "testing"   `shouldBe` 'e' ```

Little penguin Polo likes permutations. But most of all he likes permutations of integers from 0 to n, inclusive. For permutation p = p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n}, Polo has defined its beauty   number $(0 \oplus p_{0}) +(1 \oplus p_{1}) + \cdots +(n \oplus p_{n})$. Expression $x \oplus y$ means applying the operation of bitwise excluding "OR" to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in language C++ and Java it is represented as "^" and in Pascal   as "xor". Help him find among all permutations of integers from 0 to n the permutation with the maximum beauty.
