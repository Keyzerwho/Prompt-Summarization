For permutation p = p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n}, Polo has defined its beauty number $(0 \\oplus p_{0}) +(1 \\oplus p_{1}) + \\cdots +(n \\oplus p_{n})$. Expression $x \\oplus y$ means applying the operation of bitwise excluding \"OR\" to numbers x and y. This operation exists in all modern programming languages, for example, in language C++ and Java it is represented as \"^\" and in Pascal as \"xor\". Help him find among all permutations of integers from 0 to n the permutation with the maximum beauty.",
