You are given two positive integers N and K. How many multisets of rational numbers satisfy all of the following conditions   - The multiset has exactly N elements and the sum of them is equal to K.  - Each element of the multiset is one of 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots. In other words, each element can be represented as \frac{1}{2^i}\ (i = 0,1,\dots). The answer may be large, so print it modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 3000  - All values in input are integers.

You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane.  Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.   
tl;dr: you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 

Vasya has a graph containing both directed (oriented) and undirected (non-oriented) edges. There can be multiple edges between a pair of vertices. Vasya has picked a vertex s from the graph. Now Vasya wants to create two separate plans:   to orient each undirected edge in one of two possible directions to maximize number of vertices reachable from vertex s;  to orient each undirected edge in one of two possible directions to minimize number of vertices reachable from vertex s.  In each of two plans each undirected edge must become directed. For an edge chosen directions can differ in two plans. Help Vasya find the plans.
