You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero). - Select a positive integer x, and smash all the gems labeled with multiples of x. Then, for each i, if the gem labeled i remains without getting smashed, you will receive a_i yen (the currency of Japan). However, a_i may be negative, in which case you will be charged money. By optimally performing the operation, how much yen can you earn? ",
