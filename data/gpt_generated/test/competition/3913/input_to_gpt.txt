Python dictionaries are inherently unsorted. So what do you do if you need to sort the contents of a dictionary  Create a function that returns a sorted list of `(key, value)` tuples (Javascript: arrays of 2 items). The list must be sorted by the `value` and be sorted **largest to smallest**. ## 
tl;dr: Create a function that returns a sorted list of (key, value) tuples. The list must be sorted by the value from largest to smallest. 

Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it. 
tl;dr: Write a function to find the kth smallest element in a given BST. 

# Task  CodeBots decided to make a gift for CodeMaster's birthday. They got a pack of candies of various sizes from the store, but instead of giving the whole pack they are trying to make the biggest possible candy from them. On each turn it is possible:    ```  to pick any two candies of the same size and merge  them into a candy which will be two times bigger;  to pick a single candy of an even size and split it   into two equal candies half of this size each.``` What is the size of the biggest candy they can make as a gift  #

Polycarpus takes part in the "Field of Wonders" TV show. The participants of the show have to guess a hidden word as fast as possible. Initially all the letters of the word are hidden. The game consists of several turns. At each turn the participant tells a letter and the TV show host responds if there is such letter in the word or not. If there is such letter then the host reveals all such letters. For example, if the hidden word is "abacaba" and the player tells the letter "a", the host will reveal letters at all positions, occupied by "a": 1, 3, 5 and 7 (positions are numbered from left to right starting from 1). Polycarpus knows m words of exactly the same length as the hidden word. The hidden word is also known to him and appears as one of these m words. At current moment a number of turns have already been made and some letters (possibly zero) of the hidden word are already revealed. Previously Polycarp has told exactly the letters which are currently revealed. It is Polycarpus' turn. He wants to tell a letter in such a way, that the TV show host will assuredly reveal at least one more letter. Polycarpus cannot tell the letters, which are already revealed. Your task is to help Polycarpus and find out the number of letters he can tell so that the show host will assuredly reveal at least one of the remaining letters.
