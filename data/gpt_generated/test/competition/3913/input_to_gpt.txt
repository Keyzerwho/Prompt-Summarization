The USA Construction Operation (USACO) recently ordered Farmer John to arrange a row of $n$ haybale piles on the farm. The $i$-th pile contains $a_i$ haybales.  However, Farmer John has just left for vacation, leaving Bessie all on her own. Every day, Bessie the naughty cow can choose to move one haybale in any pile to an adjacent pile. Formally, in one day she can choose any two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$) such that $|i-j|=1$ and $a_i>0$ and apply $a_i = a_i - 1$, $a_j = a_j + 1$. She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy. Bessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile $1$ (i.e. to maximize $a_1$), and she only has $d$ days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile $1$ if she acts optimally! 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 

Dima is a beginner programmer. During his working process, he regularly has to repeat the following operation again and again: to remove every second element from the array. One day he has been bored with easy solutions of this problem, and he has come up with the following extravagant algorithm. Let's consider that initially array contains n numbers from 1 to n and the number i is located in the cell with the index 2i - 1 (Indices are numbered starting from one) and other cells of the array are empty. Each step Dima selects a non-empty array cell with the maximum index and moves the number written in it to the nearest empty cell to the left of the selected one. The process continues until all n numbers will appear in the first n cells of the array. For example if n = 4, the array is changing as follows: [Image]  You have to write a program that allows you to determine what number will be in the cell with index x (1   x   n) after Dima's algorithm finishes.

Polycarpus takes part in the "Field of Wonders" TV show. The participants of the show have to guess a hidden word as fast as possible. Initially all the letters of the word are hidden. The game consists of several turns. At each turn the participant tells a letter and the TV show host responds if there is such letter in the word or not. If there is such letter then the host reveals all such letters. For example, if the hidden word is "abacaba" and the player tells the letter "a", the host will reveal letters at all positions, occupied by "a": 1, 3, 5 and 7 (positions are numbered from left to right starting from 1). Polycarpus knows m words of exactly the same length as the hidden word. The hidden word is also known to him and appears as one of these m words. At current moment a number of turns have already been made and some letters (possibly zero) of the hidden word are already revealed. Previously Polycarp has told exactly the letters which are currently revealed. It is Polycarpus' turn. He wants to tell a letter in such a way, that the TV show host will assuredly reveal at least one more letter. Polycarpus cannot tell the letters, which are already revealed. Your task is to help Polycarpus and find out the number of letters he can tell so that the show host will assuredly reveal at least one of the remaining letters.
