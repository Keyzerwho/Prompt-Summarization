Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"] i.e.

# Task Elections are in progress! Given an array of numbers representing votes given to each of the candidates, and an integer which is equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election. The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all. **Note**: big arrays will be tested. #

One day, little Vasya found himself in a maze consisting of (n + 1) rooms, numbered from 1 to (n + 1). Initially, Vasya is at the first room and to get out of the maze, he needs to get to the (n + 1)-th one. The maze is organized as follows. Each room of the maze has two one-way portals. Let's consider room number i (1   i   n), someone can use the first portal to move from it to room number (i + 1), also someone can use the second portal to move from it to room number p_{i}, where 1   p_{i}   i. In order not to get lost, Vasya decided to act as follows.   Each time Vasya enters some room, he paints a cross on its ceiling. Initially, Vasya paints a cross at the ceiling of room 1.  Let's assume that Vasya is in room i and has already painted a cross on its ceiling. Then, if the ceiling now contains an odd number of crosses, Vasya uses the second portal (it leads to room p_{i}), otherwise Vasya uses the first portal.  Help Vasya determine the number of times he needs to use portals to get to room (n + 1) in the end.
