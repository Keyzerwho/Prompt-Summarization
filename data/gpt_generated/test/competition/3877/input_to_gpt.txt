Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

You are given two strings $s$ and $t$ both of length $n$ and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters. In one move, you can choose any length $len$ from $1$ to $n$ and perform the following operation:   Choose any contiguous substring of the string $s$ of length $len$ and reverse it;  at the same time choose any contiguous substring of the string $t$ of length $len$ and reverse it as well.  Note that during one move you reverse exactly one substring of the string $s$ and exactly one substring of the string $t$. Also note that borders of substrings you reverse in $s$ and in $t$ can be different, the only restriction is that you reverse the substrings of equal length. For example, if $len=3$ and $n=5$, you can reverse $s[1 \dots 3]$ and $t[3 \dots 5]$, $s[2 \dots 4]$ and $t[2 \dots 4]$, but not $s[1 \dots 3]$ and $t[1 \dots 2]$. Your task is to say if it is possible to make strings $s$ and $t$ equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves. You have to answer $q$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given two strings s and t both of length n and both consisting of lowercase Latin letters. One move is defined as taking contiguous substring of both s and t and reversing it. You need to find if it is possible to make s and t after some sequence of moves 

Masha and Grisha like studying sets of positive integers. One day Grisha has written a set A containing n different integers a_{i} on a blackboard. Now he asks Masha to create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different. Both Masha and Grisha don't like big numbers, so all numbers in A are from 1 to 10^6, and all numbers in B must also be in the same range. Help Masha to create the set B that satisfies Grisha's requirement. 
tl;dr: Set A containing n positive different integers a_{i} are given.  Create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different.  All numbers in A and B are from 1 to 10^6. 

Jon fought bravely to rescue the wildlings who were attacked by the white-walkers at Hardhome. On his arrival, Sam tells him that he wants to go to Oldtown to train at the Citadel to become a maester, so he can return and take the deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees to Sam's proposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a trainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel gave Sam a problem to test his eligibility.  Initially Sam has a list with a single element n. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In each operation Sam must remove any element x, such that x > 1, from the list and insert at the same position $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$, $x \operatorname{mod} 2$, $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$ sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1. Now the masters want the total number of 1s in the range l to r (1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test
