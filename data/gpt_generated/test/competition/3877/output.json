In each operation Sam must remove any element x, such that x > 1, from the list and insert at the same position $\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor$, $x \\operatorname{mod} 2$, $\\lfloor \\frac{x}{2} \\rfloor$ sequentially. He must continue with these operations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1. Now the masters want the total number of 1s in the range l to r (1-indexed). Sam wants to become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you help Sam to pass the eligibility test? summary :  ",
