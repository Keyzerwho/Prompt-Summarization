There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

# Task  Your Informatics teacher at school likes coming up with new ways to help you understand the material. When you started studying numeral systems, he introduced his own numeral system, which he's convinced will help clarify things. His numeral system has base 26, and its digits are represented by English capital letters - `A for 0, B for 1, and so on`.  The teacher assigned you the following numeral system exercise: given a one-digit `number`, you should find all unordered pairs of one-digit numbers whose values add up to the `number`. # 
tl;dr: Given a one-digit number, you should find all unordered pairs of one-digit numbers whose values add up to the number. 

Pavel loves grid mazes. A grid maze is an n   m rectangle maze where each cell is either empty, or is a wall. You can go from one cell to another only if both cells are empty and have a common side. Pavel drew a grid maze with all empty cells forming a connected area. That is, you can go from any empty cell to any other one. Pavel doesn't like it when his maze has too little walls. He wants to turn exactly k empty cells into walls so that all the remaining cells still formed a connected area. Help him.
