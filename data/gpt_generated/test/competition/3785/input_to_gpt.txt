Your music player contains N different songs and she wants to listen to L (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that: Every song is played at least once A song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played Return the number of possible playlists.  As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.   
tl;dr: You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 

Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.  The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle. 
tl;dr: Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.  There is a entity at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if entity moves back to the original place.  The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid entity moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the entity makes a circle. 

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are there  Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there  
tl;dr: You are at top-left corner of an m X n grid. Considering only down or right actions, how many unique paths are present to reach bottom-right corner. 

Pavel loves grid mazes. A grid maze is an n   m rectangle maze where each cell is either empty, or is a wall. You can go from one cell to another only if both cells are empty and have a common side. Pavel drew a grid maze with all empty cells forming a connected area. That is, you can go from any empty cell to any other one. Pavel doesn't like it when his maze has too little walls. He wants to turn exactly k empty cells into walls so that all the remaining cells still formed a connected area. Help him.
