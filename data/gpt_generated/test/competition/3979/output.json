Some long and uninteresting story was removed... The alphabet of Bookland is so large that its letters are denoted by positive integers. Each letter can be small or large, the large version of a letter x is denoted by x'. BSCII encoding, which is used everywhere in Bookland, is made in that way so that large letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, and small letters are presented in the order of the numbers they are denoted by, but all large letters are before all small letters. For example, the following conditions hold: 2 < 3, 2' < 3', 3' < 2. A word x_1, x_2, ..., x_{a} is not lexicographically greater than y_1, y_2, ..., y_{b} if one of the two following conditions holds:   a   b and x_1 = y_1, ..., x_{a} = y_{a}, i.e. the first word is the prefix of the second word;  there is a position 1   j  min(a, b), such that x_1 = y_1, ..., x_{j} - 1 = y_{j} - 1 and x_{j} < y_{j}, i.e. at the first position where the words differ the first word has a smaller letter than the second word has.   For example, the word \"3' 7 5\" is before the word \"2 4' 6\" in",
