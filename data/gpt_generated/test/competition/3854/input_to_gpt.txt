Given that  ``` f0 = '0' f1 = '01' f2 = '010' = f1 + f0 f3 = '01001' = f2 + f1 ``` You will be given a number and your task is to return the `nth` fibonacci string. For example: ``` solve(2) = '010' solve(3) = '01001' ``` More examples in test cases. Good luck!

tl;dr: You will be given a number and your task is to return the nth fibonacci string. 

To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size). Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing. For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with "ffff". Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'. All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case. 
tl;dr: You are given following inputs: original string S, starting index i, source word x and target word y.  If x starts at position i in S, you need to replace that occurrence of x with y. Consider: 0 <= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length <= 100 0 < indexes[i] < S.length <= 1000 All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters. 

Pari wants to buy an expensive chocolate from Arya. She has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is c_{i}. The price of the chocolate is k, so Pari will take a subset of her coins with sum equal to k and give it to Arya. Looking at her coins, a question came to her mind: after giving the coins to Arya, what values does Arya can make with them  She is jealous and she doesn't want Arya to make a lot of values. So she wants to know all the values x, such that Arya will be able to make x using some subset of coins with the sum k. Formally, Pari wants to know the values x such that there exists a subset of coins with the sum k such that some subset of this subset has the sum x, i.e. there is exists some way to pay for the chocolate, such that Arya will be able to make the sum x using these coins.
