 You are given a set of coins, their values and the price of the chocolate. You need to find all the values x such that there exists a subset of coins with the sum k such that some subset of this subset has the sum x.
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and k (1  ≤  n, k  ≤  500) — the number of coins and the price of the chocolate, respectively. Next line will contain n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 500) — the values of Pari's coins. It's guaranteed that one can make value k using these coins. -----Output----- First line of the output must contain a single integer q— the number of suitable values x. Then print q integers in ascending order — the values that Arya can make for some subset of coins of Pari that pays for the chocolate. -----Examples----- Input 6 18 5 6 1 10 12 2 Output 16 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 18  Input 3 50 25 25 50 Output 3 0 25 50
