Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012 N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N   (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches. For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows: Match Team A Team B Ad revenue 1 1 2 7  2 1 3 0  3 1 4 2  4 2 3 7  5 2 4 5  6 3 4 2  Thus the total advertising revenue is 23. 
tl;dr: You are given N teams which can play with each exactly one time.Each team is assigned a strength as a positive integer.Find the sum of all the absolute difference between the strengths of all the possible two matches. 

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between). For example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     3    / \   9  20     /  \    15   7 return its zigzag level order traversal as: [   [3],   [20,9],   [15,7]

Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to $1$ meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively). It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is $5$ seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes $1$ second. Find the skier's time to roll all the path.

There are $n$ points on the plane, the $i$-th of which is at $(x_i, y_i)$. Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area. The strange area is enclosed by three lines, $x = l$, $y = a$ and $x = r$, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $l$, $r$ and $a$ can be any real numbers satisfying that $l < r$. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $x$-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area. [Image]  A point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $l < x_i < r$ and $y_i > a$. For example, in the above figure, $p_1$ is in the area while $p_2$ is not. Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.
