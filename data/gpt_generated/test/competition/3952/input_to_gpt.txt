You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string. Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve. 
tl;dr: You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters.You have to replace a one character by other character present in the string so that the string becomes lexicographically smallest.Find that lexicographically smallest  string. 

The chef was searching for his pen in the garage but he found his old machine with a display and some numbers on it. If some numbers entered then some different output occurs on the display. Chef wants to crack the algorithm that the machine is following. 
tl;dr: Write a code to print the average of the multiplication of a given number N with N-1 integer.                                    1 

There are $n$ points on the plane, the $i$-th of which is at $(x_i, y_i)$. Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area. The strange area is enclosed by three lines, $x = l$, $y = a$ and $x = r$, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $l$, $r$ and $a$ can be any real numbers satisfying that $l < r$. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $x$-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area. [Image]  A point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $l < x_i < r$ and $y_i > a$. For example, in the above figure, $p_1$ is in the area while $p_2$ is not. Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.
