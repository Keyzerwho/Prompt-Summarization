The strange area is enclosed by three lines, $x = l$, $y = a$ and $x = r$, as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $l$, $r$ and $a$ can be any real numbers satisfying that $l < r$. The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $x$-axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area. [Image]  A point $(x_i, y_i)$ is in the strange rectangular area if and only if $l < x_i < r$ and $y_i > a$. For example, in the above figure, $p_1$ is in the area while $p_2$ is not. Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.
