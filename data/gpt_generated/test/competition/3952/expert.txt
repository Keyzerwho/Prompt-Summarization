 You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string. Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5$) — the number of points on the plane. The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th point. All points are distinct. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of different non-empty sets of points she can obtain. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 1 2 1 3 Output 3 Input 3 1 1 2 1 3 1 Output 6 Input 4 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 Output 6 -----Note----- For the first example, there is exactly one set having $k$ points for $k = 1, 2, 3$, so the total number is $3$. For the second example, the numbers of sets having $k$ points for $k = 1, 2, 3$ are $3$, $2$, $1$ respectively, and their sum is $6$. For the third example, as the following figure shows, there are  $2$ sets having one point;  $3$ sets having two points;  $1$ set having four points.  Therefore, the number of different non-empty sets in this example is $2 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 6$. [Image]
