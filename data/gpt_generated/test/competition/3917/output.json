Because he wants to make sure Iahub will be the one qualified, he tells Iahub the following task. You're given an (1-based) array a with n elements. Let's define function f(i, j) (1   i, j   n) as (i - j)^2 + g(i, j)^2. Function g is calculated by the following pseudo-code: int g(int i, int j) {     int sum = 0;     for (int k = min(i, j) + 1; k <= max(i, j); k = k + 1)         sum = sum + a[k];     return sum; } Find a value min_{i}   j  f(i, j). Probably by now Iahub already figured out the solution to this problem. Can you",
