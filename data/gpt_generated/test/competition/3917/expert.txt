 You are given an array of integers. You are asked to find the minimum value of a function of two integers. The function is defined as (i - j)^2 + g(i, j)^2. The function g is calculated by the following pseudo-code: int g(int i, int j) {     int sum = 0;     for (int k = min(i, j) + 1; k <= max(i, j); k = k + 1)        sum = sum + a[k];     return sum; } 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Next line contains n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] ( - 10^4 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^4).  -----Output----- Output a single integer — the value of min_{i} ≠ j  f(i, j). -----Examples----- Input 4 1 0 0 -1 Output 1 Input 2 1 -1 Output 2
