Jon and Joe have received equal marks in the school examination.  But, they won't reconcile in peace when equated with each other.  To prove his might, Jon challenges Joe to write a program to find all possible number combos that sum to a given number.  While unsure whether he would be able to accomplish this feat or not, Joe accpets the challenge.  Being Joe's friend, your task is to help him out. # Task Create a function `combos`, that accepts a single positive integer `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. 
tl;dr: Your need to create a function `combos` that accepts `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. For an optimal solution, the following operation should complete within 6000ms

Polycarp is reading a book consisting of $n$ pages numbered from $1$ to $n$. Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by $m$, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, pages divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. Your task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down. You have to answer $q$ independent queries. 
tl;dr: You are given a number $n$ and a value $m$. For every number from $1$ to $n$ if the number is divisible by $m$, you store tthe last digit of this number. For example, if $n=15$ and $m=5$, numbers divisible by $m$ are $5, 10, 15$. Their last digits are $5, 0, 5$ correspondingly, their sum is $10$. 

You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.  Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a_1 - x, a_2 - x, ..., a_{n} - x is as small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

Robbers, who attacked the Gerda's cab, are very successful in covering from the kingdom police. To make the goal of catching them even harder, they use their own watches. First, as they know that kingdom police is bad at math, robbers use the positional numeral system with base 7. Second, they divide one day in n hours, and each hour in m minutes. Personal watches of each robber are divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to n - 1, while the second has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to m - 1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be displayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the required number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation. Note that to display number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one place. Little robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Help her calculate this number.
