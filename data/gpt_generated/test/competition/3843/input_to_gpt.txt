Check if given chord is minor or major. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ There is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music. notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] Note that e. g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1.  
tl;dr: Given a string, determine if given string is minor or major or not a chord. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] 

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.  I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n)  returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For example: ```python    nth_fib(4) == 2 ``` Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
tl;dr: Write a function that when given a number n, returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence. 

Robbers, who attacked the Gerda's cab, are very successful in covering from the kingdom police. To make the goal of catching them even harder, they use their own watches. First, as they know that kingdom police is bad at math, robbers use the positional numeral system with base 7. Second, they divide one day in n hours, and each hour in m minutes. Personal watches of each robber are divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to n - 1, while the second has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to m - 1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be displayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the required number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation. Note that to display number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one place. Little robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular values of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches are distinct. Help her calculate this number.
