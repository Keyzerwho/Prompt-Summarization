Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:   They are equal.  If we split string a into two halves of the same size a_1 and a_2, and string b into two halves of the same size b_1 and b_2, then one of the following is correct:   a_1 is equivalent to b_1, and a_2 is equivalent to b_2  a_1 is equivalent to b_2, and a_2 is equivalent to b_1   As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent. Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn! ",
