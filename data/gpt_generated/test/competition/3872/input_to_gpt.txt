Given a board of `NxN`, distributed with tiles labeled `0` to `N  - 1`(inclusive): A solved grid will have the tiles in order of label, left to right, top to bottom. Return `true` if the board state is currently solved, and `false` if the board state is unsolved. Input will always be a square 2d array. For example, a 2x2 solved grid: ``` [ [0, 1],   [2, 3] ] ``` A 2x2 unsolved grid: ``` [ [2, 1],   [0, 3] ] ``

Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party  Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter. 
tl;dr: Calculate the number of different collisions if a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls are given where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0 and collison occurs when two boys like the same girl.  

Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:   They are equal.  If we split string a into two halves of the same size a_1 and a_2, and string b into two halves of the same size b_1 and b_2, then one of the following is correct:   a_1 is equivalent to b_1, and a_2 is equivalent to b_2  a_1 is equivalent to b_2, and a_2 is equivalent to b_1   As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent. Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!
