How many days are we represented in a foreign country  My colleagues make business trips to a foreign country. We must find the number of days our company is represented in a country. Every day that one or more colleagues are present in the country is a day that the company is represented. A single day cannot count for more than one day. Write a function that recieves a list of pairs and returns the number of days that the company is represented in the foreign country. The first number of the pair is the number of the day of arrival and the second number of the pair is the day of departure of someone who travels, i.e. 1 january is number 1 and 31 of december is 365.

It's Friday night, and Chuck is bored. He's already run 1,000 miles, stopping only to eat a family sized bag of Heatwave Doritos and a large fistful of M&Ms. He just can't stop thinking about kicking something!  There is only one thing for it, Chuck heads down to his local MMA gym and immediately challenges every fighter there to get in the cage and try and take him down... AT THE SAME TIME!  You are provided an array of strings that represent the cage and Chuck's opponents. Your task, in traditional Chuck style, is to take their heads off!! Throw punches, kicks, headbutts (or more likely - regex or iteration...) but whatever you do, remove their heads. Return the same array of strings, but with the heads ('O') removed and replaced with a space (' '). If the provided array is empty, or is an empty string, return 'Gym is empty'. If you are given an array of numbers, return 'This isn't the gym!!'. FIGHT!! *Original design of this kata was a much more beautiful thing - the test cases illustrate the idea, and the intended output. I am unable to make the actual output go over multiple lines so for now at least you will have to imagine the beauty!

Let's define the following recurrence: $$a_{n+1} = a_{n} + minDigit(a_{n}) \cdot maxDigit(a_{n}).$$ Here $minDigit(x)$ and $maxDigit(x)$ are the minimal and maximal digits in the decimal representation of $x$ without leading zeroes. For examples refer to notes. Your task is calculate $a_{K}$ for given $a_{1}$ and $K$.

Today on a lecture about strings Gerald learned a new definition of string equivalency. Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:   They are equal.  If we split string a into two halves of the same size a_1 and a_2, and string b into two halves of the same size b_1 and b_2, then one of the following is correct:   a_1 is equivalent to b_1, and a_2 is equivalent to b_2  a_1 is equivalent to b_2, and a_2 is equivalent to b_1   As a home task, the teacher gave two strings to his students and asked to determine if they are equivalent. Gerald has already completed this home task. Now it's your turn!
