Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for $n$ last days: $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the price of berPhone on the day $i$. Polycarp considers the price on the day $i$ to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if $n=6$ and $a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5]$, then the number of days with a bad price is $3$   these are days $2$ ($a_2=9$), $4$ ($a_4=6$) and $5$ ($a_5=7$). Print the number of days with a bad price. You have to answer $t$ independent data sets. 
tl;dr: you are given a list of of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index 

You are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} consisting of different integers. It is required to split this sequence into the maximum number of subsequences such that after sorting integers in each of them in increasing order, the total sequence also will be sorted in increasing order. Sorting integers in a subsequence is a process such that the numbers included in a subsequence are ordered in increasing order, and the numbers which are not included in a subsequence don't change their places. Every element of the sequence must appear in exactly one subsequence.

Little Petya likes permutations a lot. Recently his mom has presented him permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n} of length n. A permutation a of length n is a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1   a_{i}   n), all integers there are distinct.  There is only one thing Petya likes more than permutations: playing with little Masha. As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules:  Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below.  During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2.  Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p.  All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i} for all i from 1 to n. In other words, Petya applies a permutation that is inverse to q to permutation p.  We know that after the k-th move the board contained Masha's permutation s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}. Besides, we know that throughout the game process Masha's permutation never occurred on the board before the k-th move. Note that the game has exactly k moves, that is, throughout the game the coin was tossed exactly k times. Your task is to determine whether the described situation is possible or else state that Petya was mistaken somewhere. See samples and notes to them for a better understanding.
