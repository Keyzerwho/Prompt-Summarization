            "text": " Little Petya likes permutations a lot. Recently his mom has presented him permutation q_1, q_2, ..., q_{n} of length n. A permutation a of length n is a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1   a_{i}   n), all integers there are distinct. There is only one thing Petya likes more than permutations: playing with little Masha. As it turns out, Masha also has a permutation of length n. Petya decided to get the same permutation, whatever the cost may be. For that, he devised a game with the following rules: Before the beginning of the game Petya writes permutation 1, 2, ..., n on the blackboard. After that Petya makes exactly k moves, which are described below. During a move Petya tosses a coin. If the coin shows heads, he performs point 1, if the coin shows tails, he performs point 2. Let's assume that the board contains permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} at the given moment. Then Petya removes the written permutation p from the board and writes another one instead: p_{q}_1, p_{q}_2, ..., p_{q}_{n}. In other words, Petya applies permutation q (which he has got from his mother) to permutation p. All actions are similar to point 1, except that Petya writes permutation t on the board, such that: t_{q}_{i} = p_{i}",
