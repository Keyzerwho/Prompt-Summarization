Cengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named XORinacci numbers. He defined them as follows:   $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. You have to answer for $T$ independent test cases.

Richik$Richik$ has just completed his engineering and has got a job in one of the firms at Sabrina$Sabrina$ which is ranked among the top seven islands in the world in terms of the pay scale.  Since Richik$Richik$ has to travel a lot to reach the firm, the owner assigns him a number X$X$, and asks him to come to work only on the day which is a multiple of X$X$. Richik joins the firm on 1-st day but starts working from X-th day. Richik$Richik$ is paid exactly the same amount in Dollars as the day number. For example, if Richik$Richik$ has been assigned X=3$X = 3$, then he will be paid 3$3$ dollars and 6$6$ dollars on the 3rd$3rd$ and 6th$6th$ day on which he comes for work.  On N th$N-th$ day, the owner calls up Richik$Richik$ and asks him not to come to his firm anymore. Hence Richik$Richik$ demands his salary of all his working days together. Since it will take a lot of time to add, Richik$Richik$ asks help from people around him, let's see if you can help him out.  
tl;dr: You are given a number X and limit N. You need to output the sum of multiples of X upto N. 

An array of integers $p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n}$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$. There is a hidden permutation of length $n$. For each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element. Your task is to restore the permutation.

Elections in Berland are coming. There are only two candidates   Alice and Bob. The main Berland TV channel plans to show political debates. There are $n$ people who want to take part in the debate as a spectator. Each person is described by their influence and political views. There are four kinds of political views:  supporting none of candidates (this kind is denoted as "00"),  supporting Alice but not Bob (this kind is denoted as "10"),  supporting Bob but not Alice (this kind is denoted as "01"),  supporting both candidates (this kind is denoted as "11").  The direction of the TV channel wants to invite some of these people to the debate. The set of invited spectators should satisfy three conditions:  at least half of spectators support Alice (i.e. $2 \cdot a \ge m$, where $a$ is number of spectators supporting Alice and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  at least half of spectators support Bob (i.e. $2 \cdot b \ge m$, where $b$ is number of spectators supporting Bob and $m$ is the total number of spectators),  the total influence of spectators is maximal possible.  Help the TV channel direction to select such non-empty set of spectators, or tell that this is impossible.
