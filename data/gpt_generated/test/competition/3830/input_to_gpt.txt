# Task  Consider the following algorithm for constructing 26 strings S(1) .. S(26): ``` S(1) = "a"; For i in [2, 3, ..., 26]: S(i) = S(i - 1) + character(i) + S(i - 1).```  For example: ``` S(1) = "a" S(2) = S(1) + "b" + S(1) = "a" + "b" + "a" = "aba" S(3) = S(2) + "c" + S(2) = "aba" + "c" +"aba" = "abacaba" ... S(26) = S(25) + "z" + S(25)``` Finally, we got a long string S(26). Your task is to find the `k`th symbol (indexing from 1) in the string S(26). All strings consist of lowercase letters only. # Input / Output  - `[input]` integer `k`   1   k < 2^(26)  - `[output]` a string(char in C#)   the `k`th symbol of S(26

Chef Vivek is good in mathematics and likes solving problems on prime numbers. One day his friend Jatin told him about Victory numbers. Victory number can be defined as a number formed after summing up all the prime numbers till given number n. Now, chef Vivek who is very fond of solving questions on prime numbers got busy in some other tasks. Your task is to help him finding victory number. 
tl;dr: Find sum the sum of all the prime numbers which are less than the given number N. 

In the snake exhibition, there are $n$ rooms (numbered $0$ to $n - 1$) arranged in a circle, with a snake in each room. The rooms are connected by $n$ conveyor belts, and the $i$-th conveyor belt connects the rooms $i$ and $(i+1) \bmod n$. In the other words, rooms $0$ and $1$, $1$ and $2$, $\ldots$, $n-2$ and $n-1$, $n-1$ and $0$ are connected with conveyor belts. The $i$-th conveyor belt is in one of three states:  If it is clockwise, snakes can only go from room $i$ to $(i+1) \bmod n$.  If it is anticlockwise, snakes can only go from room $(i+1) \bmod n$ to $i$.  If it is off, snakes can travel in either direction.  [Image]  Above is an example with $4$ rooms, where belts $0$ and $3$ are off, $1$ is clockwise, and $2$ is anticlockwise. Each snake wants to leave its room and come back to it later. A room is returnable if the snake there can leave the room, and later come back to it using the conveyor belts. How many such returnable rooms are there
