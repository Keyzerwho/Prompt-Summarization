 You are given $n$ rooms numbered from $0$ to $n-1$ and $n$ conveyor belts. Each conveyor belt is in one of three states: clockwise, anticlockwise, or off. A room is returnable if the snake there can leave the room, and later come back to it using the conveyor belts. How many such returnable rooms are there? 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$): the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.   The first line of each test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 300\,000$): the number of rooms.  The next line of each test case description contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of only '<', '>' and '-'.  If $s_{i} = $ '>', the $i$-th conveyor belt goes clockwise.  If $s_{i} = $ '<', the $i$-th conveyor belt goes anticlockwise.  If $s_{i} = $ '-', the $i$-th conveyor belt is off.  It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ among all test cases does not exceed $300\,000$. -----Output----- For each test case, output the number of returnable rooms. -----Example----- Input 4 4 -><- 5 >>>>> 3 <-- 2 <> Output 3 5 3 0 -----Note----- In the first test case, all rooms are returnable except room $2$. The snake in the room $2$ is trapped and cannot exit. This test case corresponds to the picture from the problem statement.  In the second test case, all rooms are returnable by traveling on the series of clockwise belts.
