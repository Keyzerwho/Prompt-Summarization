Dreamoon likes coloring cells very much. There is a row of $n$ cells. Initially, all cells are empty (don't contain any color). Cells are numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are given an integer $m$ and $m$ integers $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$ ($1 \le l_i \le n$) Dreamoon will perform $m$ operations. In $i$-th operation, Dreamoon will choose a number $p_i$ from range $[1, n-l_i+1]$ (inclusive) and will paint all cells from $p_i$ to $p_i+l_i-1$ (inclusive) in $i$-th color. Note that cells may be colored more one than once, in this case, cell will have the color from the latest operation. Dreamoon hopes that after these $m$ operations, all colors will appear at least once and all cells will be colored. Please help Dreamoon to choose $p_i$ in each operation to satisfy all constraints.

Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order. For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5] Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6

**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #18 Create a function called that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one. If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

The GCD table G of size n   n for an array of positive integers a of length n is defined by formula  $g_{ij} = \operatorname{gcd}(a_{i}, a_{j})$  Let us remind you that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers x and y is the greatest integer that is divisor of both x and y, it is denoted as $\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)$. For example, for array a = {4, 3, 6, 2} of length 4 the GCD table will look as follows: [Image]  Given all the numbers of the GCD table G, restore array a.
