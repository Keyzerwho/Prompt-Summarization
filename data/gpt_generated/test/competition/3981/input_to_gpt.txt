Given a string s. Can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character  Note that size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before.  
tl;dr: Your task is to determine whether a palindrome can be made or not by deleting only one character from the given string s. 

Masha and Grisha like studying sets of positive integers. One day Grisha has written a set A containing n different integers a_{i} on a blackboard. Now he asks Masha to create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different. Both Masha and Grisha don't like big numbers, so all numbers in A are from 1 to 10^6, and all numbers in B must also be in the same range. Help Masha to create the set B that satisfies Grisha's requirement.

After the war, the supersonic rocket became the most common public transportation. Each supersonic rocket consists of two "engines". Each engine is a set of "power sources". The first engine has $n$ power sources, and the second one has $m$ power sources. A power source can be described as a point $(x_i, y_i)$ on a 2-D plane. All points in each engine are different. You can manipulate each engine separately. There are two operations that you can do with each engine. You can do each operation as many times as you want. For every power source as a whole in that engine: $(x_i, y_i)$ becomes $(x_i+a, y_i+b)$, $a$ and $b$ can be any real numbers. In other words, all power sources will be shifted. For every power source as a whole in that engine: $(x_i, y_i)$ becomes $(x_i \cos \theta - y_i \sin \theta, x_i \sin \theta + y_i \cos \theta)$, $\theta$ can be any real number. In other words, all power sources will be rotated. The engines work as follows: after the two engines are powered, their power sources are being combined (here power sources of different engines may coincide). If two power sources $A(x_a, y_a)$ and $B(x_b, y_b)$ exist, then for all real number $k$ that $0 \lt k \lt 1$, a new power source will be created $C_k(kx_a+(1-k)x_b,ky_a+(1-k)y_b)$. Then, this procedure will be repeated again with all new and old power sources. After that, the "power field" from all power sources will be generated (can be considered as an infinite set of all power sources occurred). A supersonic rocket is "safe" if and only if after you manipulate the engines, destroying any power source and then power the engine, the power field generated won't be changed (comparing to the situation where no power source erased). Two power fields are considered the same if and only if any power source in one field belongs to the other one as well. Given a supersonic rocket, check whether it is safe or not.
