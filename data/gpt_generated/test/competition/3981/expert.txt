 Given a supersonic rocket, check whether it is safe or not. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($3 \le n, m \le 10^5$) — the number of power sources in each engine. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($0\leq x_i, y_i\leq 10^8$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th power source in the first engine. Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($0\leq x_i, y_i\leq 10^8$) — the coordinates of the $i$-th power source in the second engine. It is guaranteed that there are no two or more power sources that are located in the same point in each engine. -----Output----- Print "YES" if the supersonic rocket is safe, otherwise "NO". You can print each letter in an arbitrary case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 3 4 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 Output YES Input 3 4 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 Output NO -----Note----- The first sample: [Image] Those near pairs of blue and orange points actually coincide.  First, manipulate the first engine: use the second operation with $\theta = \pi$ (to rotate all power sources $180$ degrees). The power sources in the first engine become $(0, 0)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(-2, 0)$. [Image]  Second, manipulate the second engine: use the first operation with $a = b = -2$. The power sources in the second engine become $(-2, 0)$, $(0, 0)$, $(0, -2)$, and $(-1, -1)$. [Image]  You can examine that destroying any point, the power field formed by the two engines are always the solid triangle $(0, 0)$, $(-2, 0)$, $(0, -2)$. In the second sample, no matter how you manipulate the engines, there always exists a power source in the second engine that power field will shrink if you destroy it.
