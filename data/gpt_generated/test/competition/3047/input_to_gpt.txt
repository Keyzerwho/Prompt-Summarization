Given 2 strings, your job is to find out if there is a substring that appears in both strings. You will return true if you find a substring that appears in both strings, or false if you do not. We only care about substrings that are longer than one letter long. #
tl;dr: Given 2 strings, if there is a substring that appears in both strings, return true. Otherwise, return false. We only count substrings that are > 1 in length. Lowercase and uppercase letters are the same. #

**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #16 Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the **first** not repeated character in the entire string. ``` haskell noRepeat "aabbccdde" `shouldBe` 'e' noRepeat "wxyz"      `shouldBe` 'w' noRepeat "testing"   `shouldBe` 'e' ``` 
tl;dr: Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the first not repeated character in the entire string. 

Given a credit card number we can determine who the issuer/vendor is with a few basic knowns. ```if:python Complete the function `get_issuer()` that will use the values shown below to determine the card issuer for a given card number. If the number cannot be matched then the function should return the string `Unknown`. ``` ```if-not:python Complete the function `getIssuer()` that will use the values shown below to determine the card issuer for a given card number. If the number cannot be matched then the function should return the string `Unknown`. ``` ```if:typescript Where `Issuer` is defined with the following enum type. ~~~typescript enum Issuer {   VISA = 'VISA',   AMEX = 'AMEX',   Mastercard = 'Mastercard',   Discover = 'Discover',   Unknown = 'Unknown', } ~~~ ``` ```markdown | Card Type  | Begins With          | Number Length | |------------|----------------------|---------------| | AMEX       | 34 or 37             | 15            | | Discover   | 6011                 | 16            | | Mastercard | 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55 | 16            | | VISA       | 4                    | 13 or 16      | ``` ```if:c,cpp **C/C++ note:** The return value in C is not freed. ``` ##

Theta likes to play Lure of the Labyrinth, which is an online game that uses a compelling graphic novel storyline to engage middle grades students in mathematical thinking and problem-solving. To find lost pets, students have to infiltrate a world of monsters and solve puzzles! Implemented by a professional game studio, these puzzles are quite engaging and challenging. In the manager s cafeteria, students are asked to practice proportions by serving $5$ monsters sitting at the table: Salamander, Yeti, Golem, Imp, and Kraken. Each monster wants some amount of burger, slop, sushi, and drumstick. The amount of each item each monster wants on their plate is proportional to the amount of each of the other items that monster wants, and the proportionality ratio is the same for all monsters. For instance, as shown in sample input $1$ and in the accompanying figure, if Golem (center) wants $6$ units of burger on his plate and $12$ units of drumstick, and Salamander (left) wants $40$ units of drumstick, then Salamander will want $20$ units of burger. Students practicing proportions will program the dispenser machine to release $20$ units of burger. Similarly, Kraken (right) wants $36$ units of drumstick because it has $81$ units of slop on its plate and Salamander has $40$ units of drumstick and $90$ units of slop. If the students compute all proportions in time, the monsters eat and a pet can be saved! As students progress in the game and reach more difficult levels, fewer and fewer amounts are given, requiring more intuition and thinking to solve the puzzle. Give a set of partially filled plates, write a program that computes the number of distinct solutions that are consistent with it!
