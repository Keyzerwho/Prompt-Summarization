            "text": " You are given a street split into n equal length parts from left to right, the i-th part is characterized by two integers: width of road s_{i} and width of lawn g_{i}. For each of n parts the Mayor should decide the size of lawn to demolish. For the i-th part he can reduce lawn width by integer x_{i} (0   x_{i}   g_{i}). After it new road width of the i-th part will be equal to s'_{i} = s_{i} + x_{i} and new lawn width will be equal to g'_{i} = g_{i} - x_{i}. On the one hand, the Mayor wants to demolish as much lawn as possible (and replace it with road). On the other hand, he does not want to create a rapid widening or narrowing of the road, which would lead to car accidents. To avoid that, the Mayor decided that width of the road for consecutive parts should differ by at most 1, i.e. for each i (1   i < n) the inequation |s'_{i} + 1 - s'_{i}|   1 should hold. Initially this condition might not be true. You need to find the the total width of lawns the Mayor will destroy according to his plan. ",
