You're given an integer N. Write a program to calculate the sum of all the digits of N.  
tl;dr: Write a program to calculate the sum of all the digits of given integer N.  

Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party  Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter. 
tl;dr: Calculate the number of different collisions if a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls are given where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0 and collison occurs when two boys like the same girl.  

Maxim loves to fill in a matrix in a special manner. Here is a pseudocode of filling in a matrix of size (m + 1)   (m + 1): [Image] Maxim asks you to count, how many numbers m (1   m   n) are there, such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix equals t. Expression (x xor y) means applying the operation of bitwise excluding "OR" to numbers x and y. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by character "^", in Pascal   by "xor".
