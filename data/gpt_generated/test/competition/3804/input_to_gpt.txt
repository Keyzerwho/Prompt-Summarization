You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.  Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a_1 - x, a_2 - x, ..., a_{n} - x is as small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order. For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5] Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6

Maxim loves to fill in a matrix in a special manner. Here is a pseudocode of filling in a matrix of size (m + 1)   (m + 1): [Image] Maxim asks you to count, how many numbers m (1   m   n) are there, such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number m + 1 of the resulting matrix equals t. Expression (x xor y) means applying the operation of bitwise excluding "OR" to numbers x and y. The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by character "^", in Pascal   by "xor".
