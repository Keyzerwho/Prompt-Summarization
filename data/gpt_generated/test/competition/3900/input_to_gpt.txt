Chef is baking a cake. While baking, in each minute the size of cake doubles as compared to its previous size. In this cake, baking of cake is directly proportional to its size. You are given $a$, the total time taken(in minutes) to bake the whole cake. Let cake be half baked at $k^{th}$ minute.          Your task is to find the value of $k+2$. 
tl;dr: You are given $a$, the total minutes taken to bake the whole cake and in each minute the size of cake doubles as compared to its previous size. Let cake be half baked at $k^{th}$ minute.  Find the value of $k+2$. 

Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, namely, Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If the sum of Rs. N is input, write a program to computer smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N. 
tl;dr: You are given sum of Rs. N as input, Find smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N if there are denominations notes of Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. 

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers. You want to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of $len$ to it, where $len$ is the length of this segment (added integers can be different).  It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero.

Recently a serious bug has been found in the FOS code. The head of the F company wants to find the culprit and punish him. For that, he set up an organizational meeting, the issue is: who's bugged the code  Each of the n coders on the meeting said: 'I know for sure that either x or y did it!' The head of the company decided to choose two suspects and invite them to his office. Naturally, he should consider the coders' opinions. That's why the head wants to make such a choice that at least p of n coders agreed with it. A coder agrees with the choice of two suspects if at least one of the two people that he named at the meeting was chosen as a suspect. In how many ways can the head of F choose two suspects  Note that even if some coder was chosen as a suspect, he can agree with the head's choice if he named the other chosen coder at the meeting.
