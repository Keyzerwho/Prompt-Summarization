A subsequence of a string S is a string that can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from S without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, arc, artistic and (an empty string) are all subsequences of artistic; abc and ci are not. You are given a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Find the shortest string among the strings consisting of lowercase English letters that are not subsequences of A. If there are more than one such string, find the lexicographically smallest one among them. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |A| \leq 2 \times 10^5  - A consists of lowercase English letters.

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"] i.e.

Recently a serious bug has been found in the FOS code. The head of the F company wants to find the culprit and punish him. For that, he set up an organizational meeting, the issue is: who's bugged the code  Each of the n coders on the meeting said: 'I know for sure that either x or y did it!' The head of the company decided to choose two suspects and invite them to his office. Naturally, he should consider the coders' opinions. That's why the head wants to make such a choice that at least p of n coders agreed with it. A coder agrees with the choice of two suspects if at least one of the two people that he named at the meeting was chosen as a suspect. In how many ways can the head of F choose two suspects  Note that even if some coder was chosen as a suspect, he can agree with the head's choice if he named the other chosen coder at the meeting.
