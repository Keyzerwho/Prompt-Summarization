This challenge is based on [the kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/n-smallest-elements-in-original-order) by GiacomoSorbi. Before doing this one it is advisable to complete the non-performance version first. ___ # Task You will be given an array of random integers and a number `n`. You have to extract `n` smallest integers out of it **preserving the original order**. # 
tl;dr: # Task You will be given an array of random integers and a number n. You have to extract n smallest integers out of it. The original order need to be preserved. # 

Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample. Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed. Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time. Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers. 
tl;dr: There are n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks.  Block is called internal if all its neighbors has each side adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation you can destroy all boundary blocks. Count how many operations you will take to destroy all towers. 

You are given two integers A and B. Print a grid where each square is painted white or black that satisfies the following conditions, in the format specified in Output section:  - Let the size of the grid be h \times w (h vertical, w horizontal). Both h and w are at most 100.  - The set of the squares painted white is divided into exactly A connected components.  - The set of the squares painted black is divided into exactly B connected components. It can be proved that there always exist one or more solutions under the conditions specified in Constraints section. If there are multiple solutions, any of them may be printed. -----Notes----- Two squares painted white, c_1 and c_2, are called connected when the square c_2 can be reached from the square c_1 passing only white squares by repeatedly moving up, down, left or right to an adjacent square. A set of squares painted white, S, forms a connected component when the following conditions are met:  - Any two squares in S are connected.  - No pair of a square painted white that is not included in S and a square included in S is connected. A connected component of squares painted black is defined similarly. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq A \leq 500  - 1 \leq B \leq 500
