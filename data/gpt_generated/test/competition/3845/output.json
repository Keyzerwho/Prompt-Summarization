Both h and w are at most 100. - The set of the squares painted white is divided into exactly A connected components. - The set of the squares painted black is divided into exactly B connected components. It can be proved that there always exist one or more solutions under the conditions specified in Constraints section. If there are multiple solutions, any of them may be printed. \n",
