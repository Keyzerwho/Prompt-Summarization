Motu and Patlu are racing against each other on a circular track of radius $R$. Initially they are at the same point on the track and will run in same direction .The coach ordered them to run $X$ rounds of the circular field. Patlu wants to know how many times they will meet after the race starts and  before any of them finishes $X$ rounds. But he is busy in warm up so he wants you to calculate this. You are given speed of both Motu and Patlu ($A$ and $B$).  
tl;dr: Find out how many times A and B will meet after the race starts and before completing the $X rounds if they start running from same spot on a circular track of radius $R. Their speed are given. 

Complete the function that takes an array of words. You must concatenate the `n`th letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where `n` is the position of the word in the list. For example: ``` ["yoda", "best", "has"]  -->  "yes"   ^        ^        ^   n=0     n=1     n=2 ``` **
tl;dr: Given an array of words, you must concatenate the nth letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where n is the position of the word in the list. 

You've got array A, consisting of n integers and a positive integer k. Array A is indexed by integers from 1 to n. You need to permute the array elements so that value $\sum_{i = 1}^{n - k}|A [ i ] - A [ i + k ]|$ became minimal possible. In particular, it is allowed not to change order of elements at all.

There is a square grid of size $n \times n$. Some cells are colored in black, all others are colored in white. In one operation you can select some rectangle and color all its cells in white. It costs $\min(h, w)$ to color a rectangle of size $h \times w$. You are to make all cells white for minimum total cost. The square is large, so we give it to you in a compressed way. The set of black cells is the union of $m$ rectangles.
