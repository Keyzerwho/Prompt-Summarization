Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion  Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. 
tl;dr: You have to shuffle digits of the given proportion(x : y :: z : w) in order to check that is it possible to make new proportion or not. 

Your work is to write a method that takes a value and an index, and returns the value with the bit at given index flipped. The bits are numbered from the least significant bit (index 1).

You are an intergalactic surgeon and you have an alien patient. For the purposes of this problem, we can and we will model this patient's body using a $2 \times (2k + 1)$ rectangular grid. The alien has $4k + 1$ distinct organs, numbered $1$ to $4k + 1$. In healthy such aliens, the organs are arranged in a particular way. For example, here is how the organs of a healthy such alien would be positioned, when viewed from the top, for $k = 4$: [Image]  Here, the E represents empty space.  In general, the first row contains organs $1$ to $2k + 1$ (in that order from left to right), and the second row contains organs $2k + 2$ to $4k + 1$ (in that order from left to right) and then empty space right after.  Your patient's organs are complete, and inside their body, but they somehow got shuffled around! Your job, as an intergalactic surgeon, is to put everything back in its correct position. All organs of the alien must be in its body during the entire procedure. This means that at any point during the procedure, there is exactly one cell (in the grid) that is empty. In addition, you can only move organs around by doing one of the following things:  You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate left or to its immediate right (if they exist). In reality, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space;  You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate top or its immediate bottom (if they exist) only if the empty space is on the leftmost column, rightmost column or in the centermost column. Again, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space.  Your job is to figure out a sequence of moves you must do during the surgical procedure in order to place back all $4k + 1$ internal organs of your patient in the correct cells. If it is impossible to do so, you must say so.
