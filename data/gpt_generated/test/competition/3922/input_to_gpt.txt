Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

Chef has a natural number N. Cheffina challenges chef to check whether the given number is divisible by the sum of its digits or not. If the given number is divisible then print "Yes" else "No". 
tl;dr: Check whether the given natural number N is divisible by the sum of its digits or not. If possible, then print "Yes" else "No". 

An array of integers $p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n}$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$. There is a hidden permutation of length $n$. For each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element. Your task is to restore the permutation.

You are an intergalactic surgeon and you have an alien patient. For the purposes of this problem, we can and we will model this patient's body using a $2 \times (2k + 1)$ rectangular grid. The alien has $4k + 1$ distinct organs, numbered $1$ to $4k + 1$. In healthy such aliens, the organs are arranged in a particular way. For example, here is how the organs of a healthy such alien would be positioned, when viewed from the top, for $k = 4$: [Image]  Here, the E represents empty space.  In general, the first row contains organs $1$ to $2k + 1$ (in that order from left to right), and the second row contains organs $2k + 2$ to $4k + 1$ (in that order from left to right) and then empty space right after.  Your patient's organs are complete, and inside their body, but they somehow got shuffled around! Your job, as an intergalactic surgeon, is to put everything back in its correct position. All organs of the alien must be in its body during the entire procedure. This means that at any point during the procedure, there is exactly one cell (in the grid) that is empty. In addition, you can only move organs around by doing one of the following things:  You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate left or to its immediate right (if they exist). In reality, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space;  You can switch the positions of the empty space E with any organ to its immediate top or its immediate bottom (if they exist) only if the empty space is on the leftmost column, rightmost column or in the centermost column. Again, you do this by sliding the organ in question to the empty space.  Your job is to figure out a sequence of moves you must do during the surgical procedure in order to place back all $4k + 1$ internal organs of your patient in the correct cells. If it is impossible to do so, you must say so.
