Ms. E.T. came from planet Hex. She has 8 fingers in each hand which makes her count in hexadecimal way. When she meets you, she tells you that she came from 7E light years from the planet Earth. You see she means that it is 126 light years far away and she is telling you the numbers in hexadecimal. Now, you are in trouble to understand what those numbers really mean. Therefore, you have to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimals. 
tl;dr: Write the code to convert the hexadecimal number into its corresponding decimal value. 

You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.  Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a_1 - x, a_2 - x, ..., a_{n} - x is as small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

Vasya claims that he had a paper square. He cut it into two rectangular parts using one vertical or horizontal cut. Then Vasya informed you the dimensions of these two rectangular parts. You need to check whether Vasya originally had a square. In other words, check if it is possible to make a square using two given rectangles.

Bessie the cow has just intercepted a text that Farmer John sent to Burger Queen! However, Bessie is sure that there is a secret message hidden inside. The text is a string $s$ of lowercase Latin letters. She considers a string $t$ as hidden in string $s$ if $t$ exists as a subsequence of $s$ whose indices form an arithmetic progression. For example, the string aab is hidden in string aaabb because it occurs at indices $1$, $3$, and $5$, which form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $2$. Bessie thinks that any hidden string that occurs the most times is the secret message. Two occurrences of a subsequence of $S$ are distinct if the sets of indices are different. Help her find the number of occurrences of the secret message! For example, in the string aaabb, a is hidden $3$ times, b is hidden $2$ times, ab is hidden $6$ times, aa is hidden $3$ times, bb is hidden $1$ time, aab is hidden $2$ times, aaa is hidden $1$ time, abb is hidden $1$ time, aaab is hidden $1$ time, aabb is hidden $1$ time, and aaabb is hidden $1$ time. The number of occurrences of the secret message is $6$.
