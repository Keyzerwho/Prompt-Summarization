You are given two integer sequences, each of length N: a_1, ..., a_N and b_1, ..., b_N. There are N^2 ways to choose two integers i and j such that 1 \leq i, j \leq N. For each of these N^2 pairs, we will compute a_i + b_j and write it on a sheet of paper. That is, we will write N^2 integers in total. Compute the XOR of these N^2 integers. Definition of XOR The XOR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m is defined as follows:  - Let the XOR be X. In the binary representation of X, the digit in the 2^k's place (0 \leq k; k is an integer) is 1 if there are an odd number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representation has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 if that number is even. For example, let us compute the XOR of 3 and 5. The binary representation of 3 is 011, and the binary representation of 5 is 101, thus the XOR has the binary representation 110, that is, the XOR is 6. -----Constraints-----  - All input values are integers.  - 1 \leq N \leq 200,000  - 0 \leq a_i, b_i < 2^{28}

Master Oogway has forseen that a panda named Po will be the dragon warrior, and the master of Chi. But he did not tell anyone about the spell that would make him the master of Chi, and has left Po confused. Now Po has to defeat Kai, who is the super villian, the strongest of them all. Po needs to master Chi, and he finds a spell which unlocks his powerful Chi. But the spell is rather strange. It asks Po to calculate the factorial of a number! Po is very good at mathematics, and thinks that this is very easy. So he leaves the spell, thinking it's a hoax. But little does he know that this can give him the ultimate power of Chi. Help Po by solving the spell and proving that it's not a hoax. 
tl;dr: Find the factorial of each number from 1 to given positive integer n. 

Bessie the cow has just intercepted a text that Farmer John sent to Burger Queen! However, Bessie is sure that there is a secret message hidden inside. The text is a string $s$ of lowercase Latin letters. She considers a string $t$ as hidden in string $s$ if $t$ exists as a subsequence of $s$ whose indices form an arithmetic progression. For example, the string aab is hidden in string aaabb because it occurs at indices $1$, $3$, and $5$, which form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of $2$. Bessie thinks that any hidden string that occurs the most times is the secret message. Two occurrences of a subsequence of $S$ are distinct if the sets of indices are different. Help her find the number of occurrences of the secret message! For example, in the string aaabb, a is hidden $3$ times, b is hidden $2$ times, ab is hidden $6$ times, aa is hidden $3$ times, bb is hidden $1$ time, aab is hidden $2$ times, aaa is hidden $1$ time, abb is hidden $1$ time, aaab is hidden $1$ time, aabb is hidden $1$ time, and aaabb is hidden $1$ time. The number of occurrences of the secret message is $6$.
