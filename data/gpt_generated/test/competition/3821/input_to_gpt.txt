Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} for his birthday. Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a pair of indexes i, j (1   i < j   n), such that an inequality a_{i} > a_{j} holds. Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get. 
tl;dr: You are given a sequence. You can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. You want the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Find the minimum number of inversions you can get. 

Andrey needs one more problem to conduct a programming contest. He has n friends who are always willing to help. He can ask some of them to come up with a contest problem. Andrey knows one value for each of his fiends   the probability that this friend will come up with a problem if Andrey asks him. Help Andrey choose people to ask. As he needs only one problem, Andrey is going to be really upset if no one comes up with a problem or if he gets more than one problem from his friends. You need to choose such a set of people that maximizes the chances of Andrey not getting upset.
