The objective of this Kata is to write a function that creates a dictionary of factors for a range of numbers. The key for each list in the dictionary should be the number. The list associated with each key should possess the factors for the number. If a number possesses no factors (only 1 and the number itself), the list for the key should be `['None']` The function possesses two arguments (`n` and `m`). Where `n` is the starting number and `m` is the ending number. For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``
tl;dr: Given starting number and the ending number, creates a dictionary of factors for all numbers. If a number possesses no factors , the list for the key should be `['None']` For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``

Catherine received an array of integers as a gift for March 8. Eventually she grew bored with it, and she started calculated various useless characteristics for it. She succeeded to do it for each one she came up with. But when she came up with another one   xor of all pairwise sums of elements in the array, she realized that she couldn't compute it for a very large array, thus she asked for your help. Can you do it  Formally, you need to compute $$ (a_1 + a_2) \oplus (a_1 + a_3) \oplus \ldots \oplus (a_1 + a_n) \\ \oplus (a_2 + a_3) \oplus \ldots \oplus (a_2 + a_n) \\ \ldots \\ \oplus (a_{n-1} + a_n) \\ $$ Here $x \oplus y$ is a bitwise XOR operation (i.e. $x$ ^ $y$ in many modern programming languages). You can read about it in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Bitwise_operation. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of integers. You need to compute the bitwise XOR of all pariwise sums. 

An infinitely long railway has a train consisting of n cars, numbered from 1 to n (the numbers of all the cars are distinct) and positioned in arbitrary order. David Blaine wants to sort the railway cars in the order of increasing numbers. In one move he can make one of the cars disappear from its place and teleport it either to the beginning of the train, or to the end of the train, at his desire. What is the minimum number of actions David Blaine needs to perform in order to sort the train
