Artem chooses some element of the array and removes it. For that, he gets min(a, b) points, where a and b are numbers that were adjacent with the removed number. If the number doesn't have an adjacent number to the left or right, Artem doesn't get any points. After the element is removed, the two parts of the array glue together resulting in the new array that Artem continues playing with. Borya wondered what maximum total number of points Artem can get as he plays this game.",
