Dhruvil has always been a studious person and will be completing his Engineering soon. He is always kneen about solving problems and is preparing hard for his next interview at Hackerrank. He has practiced lots of problems and now he came across this problem. Given a message containing English letters(A-Z), it is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1,'B' -> 2        'Z' -> 26. Now, given a non-empty string containing only digits, help Dhruvil determine the total number of ways to decode it. While decoding you need to choose a substring of charachters and not a subsequence. Also a chosen substring should not contain any leading "0"s, but can contain trailing "0"s. Since the output can be very large print the answer as modulo 10^9 + 7 i.e 1000000007.

You are given a directed graph of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$. There is a token in vertex $1$. The following actions are allowed:   Token movement. To move the token from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ if there is an edge $u \to v$ in the graph. This action takes $1$ second.  Graph transposition. To transpose all the edges in the graph: replace each edge $u \to v$ by an edge $v \to u$. This action takes increasingly more time: $k$-th transposition takes $2^{k-1}$ seconds, i.e. the first transposition takes $1$ second, the second one takes $2$ seconds, the third one takes $4$ seconds, and so on.  The goal is to move the token from vertex $1$ to vertex $n$ in the shortest possible time. Print this time modulo $998\,244\,353$.

Artem has an array of n positive integers. Artem decided to play with it. The game consists of n moves. Each move goes like this. Artem chooses some element of the array and removes it. For that, he gets min(a, b) points, where a and b are numbers that were adjacent with the removed number. If the number doesn't have an adjacent number to the left or right, Artem doesn't get any points.  After the element is removed, the two parts of the array glue together resulting in the new array that Artem continues playing with. Borya wondered what maximum total number of points Artem can get as he plays this game.
