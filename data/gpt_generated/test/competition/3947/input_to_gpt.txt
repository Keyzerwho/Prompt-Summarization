Chef loves triangles. But the chef is poor at maths. Given three random lengths Chef wants to find if the three sides form a right-angled triangle or not. Can you help Chef in this endeavour  
tl;dr: Given lengths $A,B and C$ return YES if they can form a right angled triangle, NO otherwise. 

Implement a function which  creates a **[radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)** (a space-optimized trie [prefix tree])  in which each node that is the only child is merged with its parent [unless a word from the input ends there])  from a given list of words  using dictionaries (aka hash maps or hash tables) where: 1. The dictionary keys are the nodes. 2. Leaf nodes are empty dictionaries. 3. The value for empty input is an empty dictionary. 4. Words are all lowercase or empty strings. 5. Words can contain duplicates. ###

Artem has an array of n positive integers. Artem decided to play with it. The game consists of n moves. Each move goes like this. Artem chooses some element of the array and removes it. For that, he gets min(a, b) points, where a and b are numbers that were adjacent with the removed number. If the number doesn't have an adjacent number to the left or right, Artem doesn't get any points.  After the element is removed, the two parts of the array glue together resulting in the new array that Artem continues playing with. Borya wondered what maximum total number of points Artem can get as he plays this game.
