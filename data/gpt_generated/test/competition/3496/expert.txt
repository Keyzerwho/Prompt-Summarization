 You are given a number of atoms with different number of neutrons. You need to find minimum amount of energy that can be released upon explodification of these atoms. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$, $1 \leq q \leq 10^5$), the neutron threshold and the number of experiments.  - One line with $n$ integers $a_1,\ldots ,a_ n$ ($1 \leq a_ i \leq 10^9$ for each $i$), where $a_ i$ is the amount of energy released when an atom with $i$ neutrons is explodificated.  - Then $q$ lines follow, each with an integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 10^9$), asking for the minimum energy released when an atom with $k$ neutrons is explodificated. -----Output----- For each query $k$, output the minimum energy released when an atom with $k$ neutrons is explodificated. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 5 2 3 5 7 2 3 5 6 8 Sample Output: 3 5 8 10 13
