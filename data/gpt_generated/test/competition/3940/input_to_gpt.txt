Given a string s. Can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character  Note that size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before.  
tl;dr: Your task is to determine whether a palindrome can be made or not by deleting only one character from the given string s. 

Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values.  For example: `[23, 3, 19, 21, 16]` should return `20` (i.e., `23 - 3`). `[1, 434, 555, 34, 112]` should return `554` (i.e., `555 - 1`). The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow

Alyona's mother wants to present an array of n non-negative integers to Alyona. The array should be special.  Alyona is a capricious girl so after she gets the array, she inspects m of its subarrays. Subarray is a set of some subsequent elements of the array. The i-th subarray is described with two integers l_{i} and r_{i}, and its elements are a[l_{i}], a[l_{i} + 1], ..., a[r_{i}]. Alyona is going to find mex for each of the chosen subarrays. Among these m mexes the girl is going to find the smallest. She wants this minimum mex to be as large as possible.  You are to find an array a of n elements so that the minimum mex among those chosen by Alyona subarrays is as large as possible. The mex of a set S is a minimum possible non-negative integer that is not in S.
