Little Petya likes points a lot. Recently his mom has presented him n points lying on the line OX. Now Petya is wondering in how many ways he can choose three distinct points so that the distance between the two farthest of them doesn't exceed d. Note that the order of the points inside the group of three chosen points doesn't matter. 
tl;dr: Given a list of n points in one-dimensional space, find the number of ways to select 3 points such that the distance between any two is not greater than d. 

In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks.

In Arcady's garden there grows a peculiar apple-tree that fruits one time per year. Its peculiarity can be explained in following way: there are n inflorescences, numbered from 1 to n. Inflorescence number 1 is situated near base of tree and any other inflorescence with number i (i > 1) is situated at the top of branch, which bottom is p_{i}-th inflorescence and p_{i} < i. Once tree starts fruiting, there appears exactly one apple in each inflorescence. The same moment as apples appear, they start to roll down along branches to the very base of tree. Each second all apples, except ones in first inflorescence simultaneously roll down one branch closer to tree base, e.g. apple in a-th inflorescence gets to p_{a}-th inflorescence. Apples that end up in first inflorescence are gathered by Arcady in exactly the same moment. Second peculiarity of this tree is that once two apples are in same inflorescence they annihilate. This happens with each pair of apples, e.g. if there are 5 apples in same inflorescence in same time, only one will not be annihilated and if there are 8 apples, all apples will be annihilated. Thus, there can be no more than one apple in each inflorescence in each moment of time. Help Arcady with counting number of apples he will be able to collect from first inflorescence during one harvest.
