If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out.

Jon and Joe have received equal marks in the school examination.  But, they won't reconcile in peace when equated with each other.  To prove his might, Jon challenges Joe to write a program to find all possible number combos that sum to a given number.  While unsure whether he would be able to accomplish this feat or not, Joe accpets the challenge.  Being Joe's friend, your task is to help him out. # Task Create a function `combos`, that accepts a single positive integer `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. 
tl;dr: Your need to create a function `combos` that accepts `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. For an optimal solution, the following operation should complete within 6000ms

A group of n friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2. There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the i-th friend is r_{i}. The friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all n friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal. One way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than n) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so r_{i} = 0 doesn't change after losing. The friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members). The friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible. Help the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.
