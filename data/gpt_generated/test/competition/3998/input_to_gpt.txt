Chef loves triangles. But the chef is poor at maths. Given three random lengths Chef wants to find if the three sides form a right-angled triangle or not. Can you help Chef in this endeavour  
tl;dr: Given lengths $A,B and C$ return YES if they can form a right angled triangle, NO otherwise. 

There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

A group of n friends enjoys playing popular video game Toda 2. There is a rating system describing skill level of each player, initially the rating of the i-th friend is r_{i}. The friends decided to take part in the championship as a team. But they should have equal ratings to be allowed to compose a single team consisting of all n friends. So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal. One way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than n) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so r_{i} = 0 doesn't change after losing. The friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members). The friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible. Help the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.
