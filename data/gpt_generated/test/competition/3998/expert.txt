 Friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible. Help the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of friends. The second line contains n non-negative integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n} (0 ≤ r_{i} ≤ 100), where r_{i} is the initial rating of the i-th friend. -----Output----- In the first line, print a single integer R — the final rating of each of the friends. In the second line, print integer t — the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following t lines should contain n characters '0' or '1', where the j-th character of the i-th line is equal to:   '0', if friend j should not play in match i,  '1', if friend j should play in match i.  Each line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive. The value t should not exceed 10^4, it is guaranteed that such solution exists.  Remember that you shouldn't minimize the value t, but you should maximize R. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 5 4 5 1 7 4 Output 1 8 01010 00011 01010 10010 00011 11000 00011 11000 Input 2 1 2 Output 0 2 11 11 Input 3 1 1 1 Output 1 0
