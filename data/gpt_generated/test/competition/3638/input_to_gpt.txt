Take an integer `n (n >= 0)` and a digit `d (0 <= d <= 9)` as an integer. Square all numbers `k (0 <= k <= n)` between 0 and n. Count the numbers of  digits `d` used in the writing of all the `k**2`. Call `nb_dig` (or nbDig or ...) the function taking `n` and `d` as parameters and returning this count. #
tl;dr: Take an integer 'n' (n >= 0) and a digit 'd' (0 <= d <= 9) as an integer. Square all numbers 'k' (0 <= k <= n) between 0 and 'n'. Count the numbers of  digits 'd' used in the writing of all the 'k**2'. Write the function taking 'n' and 'd' as parameters and returning this count. #

Alice's school is planning to take some students from her class on a field trip. Alice is really excited about it. There are a total of S students in her class. But due to budget constraints, the school is planning to take only N students for the trip. These students will be picked randomly. And each student has equal chance of being picked. Alice's friend circle has M students including her. Though she is excited about the field trip, she will enjoy it only if there are atleast K of her friends with her on the trip. She is wondering what are the chances of that happening. She needs your help. Tell her the probability that she will enjoy given that she goes on the trip. 
tl;dr: Only N items can be chosen randomly from a total of S items. You need M item including your one personal item. If there are atleast K item which are required and one your own item. What is the probability that you will purchase your K item with your one personal item. 

Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable x and its coefficient. If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution". If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions". If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of x is an integer. 
tl;dr: Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". For the equation, if there is no solution, return "No solution" or if infinite solutions, return "Infinite solutions" or if exactly one solution for the equation, ensure that the value of x is an integer. 

Curse your rival! Every year at the annual Rock Paper Scissors tournament, you have made it to the final match. (Your Rock technique is unmatched, and your Paper cuts to the bone! Your Scissors need a little work, though.) But every year, he defeats you, even though his moves appear entirely random! And he claims to the press that he simply cannot be beaten. What is his secret  Fortunately, you think you have figured it out. This year, just before the tournament, you caught him visiting various shamans around town. Aha! He is using the supernatural against you! You figured two can play at this game. So you went and visited a set of fortune-tellers, who have each used a Tarot deck to predict a sequence that your rival will end up using, sometime during the match. However, your initial excitement has passed, and now you are feeling a little silly. This cannot possibly work, right  In the end it feels like you have paid good money for a fraudulent, random set of predictions. Oh well; you might as well keep an eye out for some of them during the match. But which predictions will you use  In the final match, you and your rival will play $n$ rounds of Rock Paper Scissors. In each round, your rival and you will both choose one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). Based on your selections, a winner of the round will be determined (exactly how is irrelevant to this problem). Given the length of the final match and the various predictions, sort them in order of how likely they are to appear sometime during the match as a contiguous sequence of options chosen by your rival, assuming he is choosing his symbol in each round independently and uniformly at random.
