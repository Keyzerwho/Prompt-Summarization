In one operation, you can choose any $2$ distinct leaves $u$, $v$ and any real number $x$ and add $x$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $u$ and $v$. For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding $2$ on the path from $7$ to $6$, and then adding $-0.5$ on the path from $4$ to $5$.   [Image] Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations?  Leaf is a node of a tree of degree $1$. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice. ",
