Vasya claims that he had a paper square. He cut it into two rectangular parts using one vertical or horizontal cut. Then Vasya informed you the dimensions of these two rectangular parts. You need to check whether Vasya originally had a square. In other words, check if it is possible to make a square using two given rectangles.

Snuke is playing a puzzle game. In this game, you are given a rectangular board of dimensions R   C, filled with numbers. Each integer i from 1 through N is written twice, at the coordinates (x_{i,1},y_{i,1}) and (x_{i,2},y_{i,2}). The objective is to draw a curve connecting the pair of points where the same integer is written, for every integer from 1 through N. Here, the curves may not go outside the board or cross each other. Determine whether this is possible. -----Constraints-----  - 1   R,C   10^8  - 1   N   10^5  - 0   x_{i,1},x_{i,2}   R(1   i   N)  - 0   y_{i,1},y_{i,2}   C(1   i   N)  - All given points are distinct.  - All input values are integers.

Note that this is the first problem of the two similar problems. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems. You are given a tree with $n$ nodes. In the beginning, $0$ is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any $2$ distinct leaves $u$, $v$ and any real number $x$ and add $x$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $u$ and $v$. For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding $2$ on the path from $7$ to $6$, and then adding $-0.5$ on the path from $4$ to $5$.   [Image]  Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations  Leaf is a node of a tree of degree $1$. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.
