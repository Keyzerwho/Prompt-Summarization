Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem: There are two arrays of integers $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. It turned out that array $a$ contains only elements from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:  Choose any pair of indexes $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$. It is possible to choose the same pair $(i, j)$ more than once.   Add $a_i$ to $a_j$. In other words, $j$-th element of the array becomes equal to $a_i + a_j$.  For example, if you are given array $[1, -1, 0]$, you can transform it only to $[1, -1, -1]$, $[1, 0, 0]$ and $[1, -1, 1]$ by one operation. Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $a$ so that it becomes equal to array $b$. Can you help him

Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion  Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. 
tl;dr: You have to shuffle digits of the given proportion(x : y :: z : w) in order to check that is it possible to make new proportion or not. 

Note that this is the first problem of the two similar problems. You can hack this problem only if you solve both problems. You are given a tree with $n$ nodes. In the beginning, $0$ is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any $2$ distinct leaves $u$, $v$ and any real number $x$ and add $x$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $u$ and $v$. For example, on the picture below you can see the result of applying two operations to the graph: adding $2$ on the path from $7$ to $6$, and then adding $-0.5$ on the path from $4$ to $5$.   [Image]  Is it true that for any configuration of real numbers written on edges, we can achieve it with a finite number of operations  Leaf is a node of a tree of degree $1$. Simple path is a path that doesn't contain any node twice.
