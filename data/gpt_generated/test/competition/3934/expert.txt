 You are given a tree with $n$ nodes. In the beginning, $0$ is written on all edges. In one operation, you can choose any $2$ distinct leaves $u$, $v$ and any real number $x$ and add $x$ to values written on all edges on the simple path between $u$ and $v$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of nodes. Each of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \neq v$), meaning that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree. -----Output----- If there is a configuration of real numbers written on edges of the tree that we can't achieve by performing the operations, output "NO".  Otherwise, output "YES".  You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 Output YES Input 3 1 2 2 3 Output NO Input 5 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 Output NO Input 6 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 6 Output YES -----Note----- In the first example, we can add any real $x$ to the value written on the only edge $(1, 2)$.  [Image]  In the second example, one of configurations that we can't reach is $0$ written on $(1, 2)$ and $1$ written on $(2, 3)$.  $8$  Below you can see graphs from examples $3$, $4$:  [Image]   [Image]
