For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000. 
tl;dr: Given a number, determine how many positive integers less than or equal to the number are odd but not prime. Assume it is an integer between 1 and 10000. 

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ non-negative integers. You have to choose a non-negative integer $x$ and form a new array $b$ of size $n$ according to the following rule: for all $i$ from $1$ to $n$, $b_i = a_i \oplus x$ ($\oplus$ denotes the operation bitwise XOR). An inversion in the $b$ array is a pair of integers $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$ and $b_i > b_j$. You should choose $x$ in such a way that the number of inversions in $b$ is minimized. If there are several options for $x$   output the smallest one.

Sereja has two sequences a and b and number p. Sequence a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Similarly, sequence b consists of m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q + (m - 1) p   n; q   1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence a_{q}, a_{q} + p, a_{q} + 2p, ..., a_{q} + (m - 1)p by rearranging elements. Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q.
