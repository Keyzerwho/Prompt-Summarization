You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers. You want to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of $len$ to it, where $len$ is the length of this segment (added integers can be different).  It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero.

Given an integer num, find the closest two integers in absolute difference whose product equals num + 1 or num + 2. Return the two integers in any order.

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships. 
tl;dr: Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 

Sereja has two sequences a and b and number p. Sequence a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Similarly, sequence b consists of m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{m}. As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q + (m - 1) p   n; q   1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence a_{q}, a_{q} + p, a_{q} + 2p, ..., a_{q} + (m - 1)p by rearranging elements. Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q.
