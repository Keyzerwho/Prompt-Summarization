As usual, Sereja studies the sequences he has. Today he wants to find the number of positions q (q + (m - 1) p   n; q   1), such that sequence b can be obtained from sequence a_{q}, a_{q} + p, a_{q} + 2p, ..., a_{q} + (m - 1)p by rearranging elements. Sereja needs to rush to the gym, so he asked to find all the described positions of q. ",
