You are given two positive integers N and K. How many multisets of rational numbers satisfy all of the following conditions   - The multiset has exactly N elements and the sum of them is equal to K.  - Each element of the multiset is one of 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots. In other words, each element can be represented as \frac{1}{2^i}\ (i = 0,1,\dots). The answer may be large, so print it modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 3000  - All values in input are integers.

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers and an integer $s$. It is guaranteed that $n$ is odd. In one operation you can either increase or decrease any single element by one. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the array being equal to $s$. The median of the array with odd length is the value of the element which is located on the middle position after the array is sorted. For example, the median of the array $6, 5, 8$ is equal to $6$, since if we sort this array we will get $5, 6, 8$, and $6$ is located on the middle position.

At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

Snuke is buying a lamp. The light of the lamp can be adjusted to m levels of brightness, represented by integers from 1 through m, by the two buttons on the remote control. The first button is a "forward" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level is increased by 1, except when the brightness level is m, in which case the brightness level becomes 1. The second button is a "favorite" button. When this button is pressed, the brightness level becomes the favorite brightness level x, which is set when the lamp is purchased. Snuke is thinking of setting the favorite brightness level x so that he can efficiently adjust the brightness. He is planning to change the brightness n-1 times. In the i-th change, the brightness level is changed from a_i to a_{i+1}. The initial brightness level is a_1. Find the number of times Snuke needs to press the buttons when x is set to minimize this number. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq n,m \leq 10^5  - 1 \leq a_i\leq m  - a_i \neq a_{i+1}  - n, m and a_i are integers.
