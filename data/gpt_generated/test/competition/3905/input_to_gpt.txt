Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees. 
tl;dr: You are given three angles of a triangle.Check whether these angles form a valid triangle or not.  

Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

BigData Inc. is a corporation that has n data centers indexed from 1 to n that are located all over the world. These data centers provide storage for client data (you can figure out that client data is really big!). Main feature of services offered by BigData Inc. is the access availability guarantee even under the circumstances of any data center having an outage. Such a guarantee is ensured by using the two-way replication. Two-way replication is such an approach for data storage that any piece of data is represented by two identical copies that are stored in two different data centers. For each of m company clients, let us denote indices of two different data centers storing this client data as c_{i}, 1 and c_{i}, 2. In order to keep data centers operational and safe, the software running on data center computers is being updated regularly. Release cycle of BigData Inc. is one day meaning that the new version of software is being deployed to the data center computers each day. Data center software update is a non-trivial long process, that is why there is a special hour-long time frame that is dedicated for data center maintenance. During the maintenance period, data center computers are installing software updates, and thus they may be unavailable. Consider the day to be exactly h hours long. For each data center there is an integer u_{j} (0   u_{j}   h - 1) defining the index of an hour of day, such that during this hour data center j is unavailable due to maintenance. Summing up everything above, the condition u_{c}_{i}, 1   u_{c}_{i}, 2 should hold for each client, or otherwise his data may be unaccessible while data centers that store it are under maintenance. Due to occasional timezone change in different cities all over the world, the maintenance time in some of the data centers may change by one hour sometimes. Company should be prepared for such situation, that is why they decided to conduct an experiment, choosing some non-empty subset of data centers, and shifting the maintenance time for them by an hour later (i.e. if u_{j} = h - 1, then the new maintenance hour would become 0, otherwise it would become u_{j} + 1). Nonetheless, such an experiment should not break the accessibility guarantees, meaning that data of any client should be still available during any hour of a day after the data center maintenance times are changed. Such an experiment would provide useful insights, but changing update time is quite an expensive procedure, that is why the company asked you to find out the minimum number of data centers that have to be included in an experiment in order to keep the data accessibility guarantees.
