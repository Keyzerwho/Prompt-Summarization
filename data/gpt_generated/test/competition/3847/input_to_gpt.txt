Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012 N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N   (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches. For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows: Match Team A Team B Ad revenue 1 1 2 7  2 1 3 0  3 1 4 2  4 2 3 7  5 2 4 5  6 3 4 2  Thus the total advertising revenue is 23. 
tl;dr: You are given N teams which can play with each exactly one time.Each team is assigned a strength as a positive integer.Find the sum of all the absolute difference between the strengths of all the possible two matches. 

Check if given chord is minor or major. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ There is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music. notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] Note that e. g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1.  
tl;dr: Given a string, determine if given string is minor or major or not a chord. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] 

You are given two arrays $a$ and $b$ of positive integers, with length $n$ and $m$ respectively.  Let $c$ be an $n \times m$ matrix, where $c_{i,j} = a_i \cdot b_j$.  You need to find a subrectangle of the matrix $c$ such that the sum of its elements is at most $x$, and its area (the total number of elements) is the largest possible. Formally, you need to find the largest number $s$ such that it is possible to choose integers $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2$ subject to $1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n$, $1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq m$, $(x_2 - x_1 + 1) \times (y_2 - y_1 + 1) = s$, and $$\sum_{i=x_1}^{x_2}{\sum_{j=y_1}^{y_2}{c_{i,j}}} \leq x.$$
