Snuke will paint each vertex white or black. The niceness of a way of painting the graph is max(X, Y), where X is the maximum among the distances between white vertices, and Y is the maximum among the distances between black vertices. Here, if there is no vertex of one color, we consider the maximum among the distances between vertices of that color to be 0. There are 2^N ways of painting the graph. Compute the sum of the nicenesses of all those ways, modulo (10^9+7). ",
