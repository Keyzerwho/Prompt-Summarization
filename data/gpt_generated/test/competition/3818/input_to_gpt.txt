# Invalid Login - Bug Fixing #11 Oh NO! Timmy has moved divisions... but now he's in the field of security. Timmy, being the top coder he is, has allowed some bad code through. You must help Timmy and filter out any injected code! ## Task Your task is simple, search the password string for any injected code (Injected code is any thing that would be used to exploit flaws in the current code, so basically anything that contains `||` or `//`) if you find any you must return `"Wrong username or password!"` because no one likes someone trying to cheat their way in! ## Preloaded You will be given a preloaded class called `Database` with a method `login` this takes two parameters `username` and `password`. This is a generic login function which will check the database for the user it will return either `'Successfully Logged in!'` if it passes the test or `'Wrong username or password!'` if either the password is wrong or username does not exist. ## Usage ```python database = Database() database.login('Timmy', 'password') ``

Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 5. If any of the permutations is divisible by 5 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: If any of the permutations of a given number  N is divisible by 5, then print 1 else print 0. 

Given is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N, and N-1 edges numbered 1 to N-1. Edge i connects Vertex a_i and b_i bidirectionally and has a length of 1. Snuke will paint each vertex white or black. The niceness of a way of painting the graph is \max(X, Y), where X is the maximum among the distances between white vertices, and Y is the maximum among the distances between black vertices. Here, if there is no vertex of one color, we consider the maximum among the distances between vertices of that color to be 0. There are 2^N ways of painting the graph. Compute the sum of the nicenesses of all those ways, modulo (10^{9}+7). -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{5}  - 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N  - The given graph is a tree.
