You have the `radius` of a circle with the center in point `(0,0)`. Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where `(x,y)` - the cartesian coordinates of the points - are `integers`. 
tl;dr: You have the radius of a circle with the center in point (0,0). Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where (x,y) are integers.  0 <= radius <= 1000. 

Chef wants you to distribute candies among $N$ kids who are sitting in a circle. However, he wants to make some kids jealous of others. Thus, he wants you to distribute candies in such a way that there is a difference of at least $K$ candies between two adjacent kids.  Given the value of $N$ and $K$, you need to find the minimum number of candies you need to satisfy the given conditions, such that, each kid gets at least one candy. 
tl;dr: You are given $N$ nodes arranged in a cycle initialised to zero and a difference $K$.  Find and return the minimum number of increments required so that each node is atleast $1$ and adjacent nodes have a difference of is atleast $K$. 

Your work is to write a method that takes a value and an index, and returns the value with the bit at given index flipped. The bits are numbered from the least significant bit (index 1). 
tl;dr: Your work is to write a method that takes a value and an index, and returns the value with the bit at given index flipped. The bits are numbered from the least significant bit. The index number can be out of number's range. 

Given is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N, and N-1 edges numbered 1 to N-1. Edge i connects Vertex a_i and b_i bidirectionally and has a length of 1. Snuke will paint each vertex white or black. The niceness of a way of painting the graph is \max(X, Y), where X is the maximum among the distances between white vertices, and Y is the maximum among the distances between black vertices. Here, if there is no vertex of one color, we consider the maximum among the distances between vertices of that color to be 0. There are 2^N ways of painting the graph. Compute the sum of the nicenesses of all those ways, modulo (10^{9}+7). -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^{5}  - 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq N  - The given graph is a tree.
