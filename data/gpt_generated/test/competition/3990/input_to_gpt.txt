Sereja has two integers   A and B   in 7-ary system. He wants to calculate the number C, such that B * C = A. It is guaranteed that B is a divisor of A. Please, help Sereja calculate the number C modulo 7L. 
tl;dr: You are given two positive integers   A and B   in 7-ary system such that B * C = A and  B is a divisor of A. Calculate the number C modulo 7L. 

Kshitij has recently started solving problems on codechef. As he is real problem solving enthusiast, he wants continuous growth in number of problems solved per day. He started with $a$  problems on first day.  He solves $d$ problems more than previous day. But after every $k$ days , he increases $d$ by $inc$ . Can you guess how many questions he will solve on $nth $ day   
tl;dr: Find the number of questions you will solve on $nth $ day if on first day you solved $a$ problems and after that you solved $d$ problems more than previous day. But after every $k$ days , you increased $d$ by $inc$. 

It is Borya's eleventh birthday, and he has got a great present: n cards with numbers. The i-th card has the number a_{i} written on it. Borya wants to put his cards in a row to get one greater number. For example, if Borya has cards with numbers 1, 31, and 12, and he puts them in a row in this order, he would get a number 13112. He is only 11, but he already knows that there are n! ways to put his cards in a row. But today is a special day, so he is only interested in such ways that the resulting big number is divisible by eleven. So, the way from the previous paragraph is good, because 13112 = 1192   11, but if he puts the cards in the following order: 31, 1, 12, he would get a number 31112, it is not divisible by 11, so this way is not good for Borya. Help Borya to find out how many good ways to put the cards are there. Borya considers all cards different, even if some of them contain the same number. For example, if Borya has two cards with 1 on it, there are two good ways. Help Borya, find the number of good ways to put the cards. This number can be large, so output it modulo 998244353.

In Absurdistan, there are n towns (numbered 1 through n) and m bidirectional railways. There is also an absurdly simple road network   for each pair of different towns x and y, there is a bidirectional road between towns x and y if and only if there is no railway between them. Travelling to a different town using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour. A train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town n, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town n). The train can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads. You've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any road/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is safety   in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the bus must not arrive at the same town (except town n) simultaneously. Under these constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both vehicles to reach town n (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the train)  Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town n at the same moment of time, but are allowed to do so.
