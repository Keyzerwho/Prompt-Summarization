Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer. For example, the number `417` is `110100001` in binary. Reversing the binary is `100001011` which is `267`. You can assume that the number is not negative
tl;dr: Reverses the bits in a positive integer. 

Ms. E.T. came from planet Hex. She has 8 fingers in each hand which makes her count in hexadecimal way. When she meets you, she tells you that she came from 7E light years from the planet Earth. You see she means that it is 126 light years far away and she is telling you the numbers in hexadecimal. Now, you are in trouble to understand what those numbers really mean. Therefore, you have to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimals. 
tl;dr: Write the code to convert the hexadecimal number into its corresponding decimal value. 

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out. ###

Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \to 2 \to \ldots n \to 1$. Flight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\to$ $2$-nd planet $\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\to$ $\ldots$ $\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\to$ the $n$-th planet $\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\to$ the $1$-st planet. The mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet.  For example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons.  Please note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well. Help Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.
