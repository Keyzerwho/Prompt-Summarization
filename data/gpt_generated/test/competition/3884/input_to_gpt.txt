Mr. Das is a teacher teaching for several years in a school. He is not computer savvy. Due to lockdown, now he has to take classes online. Recently he took an online exam for students of different classes. Now, he will call parents of all the students who scored lower than average marks for the class. He has requested you to give the name $X$, parent's phone number $P$, and marks obtained $M$ to him. 
tl;dr: You are given n students with their name, parent's phonenumber and marks of a class.Find all the students who scored lower than average marks for the class.  

Sasha likes programming. Once, during a very long contest, Sasha decided that he was a bit tired and needed to relax. So he did. But since Sasha isn't an ordinary guy, he prefers to relax unusually. During leisure time Sasha likes to upsolve unsolved problems because upsolving is very useful. Therefore, Sasha decided to upsolve the following problem: You have an array $a$ with $n$ integers. You need to count the number of funny pairs $(l, r)$ $(l \leq r)$. To check if a pair $(l, r)$ is a funny pair, take $mid = \frac{l + r - 1}{2}$, then if $r - l + 1$ is an even number and $a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{mid} = a_{mid + 1} \oplus a_{mid + 2} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r$, then the pair is funny. In other words, $\oplus$ of elements of the left half of the subarray from $l$ to $r$ should be equal to $\oplus$ of elements of the right half. Note that $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. It is time to continue solving the contest, so Sasha asked you to solve this task.

Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on $n - 2$ intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from $1$ to $n$. $1$ is Earth, $n$ is Mars. Natasha will make exactly $n$ flights: $1 \to 2 \to \ldots n \to 1$. Flight from $x$ to $y$ consists of two phases: take-off from planet $x$ and landing to planet $y$. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the $1$-st planet $\to$ take-off from the $1$-st planet $\to$ landing to the $2$-nd planet $\to$ $2$-nd planet $\to$ take-off from the $2$-nd planet $\to$ $\ldots$ $\to$ landing to the $n$-th planet $\to$ the $n$-th planet $\to$ take-off from the $n$-th planet $\to$ landing to the $1$-st planet $\to$ the $1$-st planet. The mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is $m$ tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that $1$ ton of fuel can lift off $a_i$ tons of rocket from the $i$-th planet or to land $b_i$ tons of rocket onto the $i$-th planet.  For example, if the weight of rocket is $9$ tons, weight of fuel is $3$ tons and take-off coefficient is $8$ ($a_i = 8$), then $1.5$ tons of fuel will be burnt (since $1.5 \cdot 8 = 9 + 3$). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be $1.5$ tons.  Please note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well. Help Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.
