The table must meet the following requirement: each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table. Rectangles should be filled with cells, that is, if a component form a rectangle of size h \u00a0w, then the component must contain exactly hw cells. A connected component of the same values is a set of cells of the table that meet the following conditions: every two cells of the set have the same value; the cells of the set form a connected region on the table (two cells are connected if they are adjacent in some row or some column of the table); it is impossible to add any cell to the set unless we violate the two previous conditions. Given a rectangular table with n rows and m columns, can you change the values of at most k cells of the table so that the table met the described requirement? What minimum number of table cells should you change in this case?",
