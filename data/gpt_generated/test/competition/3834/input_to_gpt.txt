Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in reverse order without any punctuation marks. For example consider the following candidate for the input text: $ $ This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem.  If you are smart you will solve this right. $ $ The corresponding output would read as: $ $ right this solve will you smart are you If problem this illustrate to text of piece sample a is This $ $ That is, the lines are printed in reverse order and in each line the words are printed in reverse order. 
tl;dr: Print the words in the line in reveres order of a given line without any punctuation marks. 

Sereja has an n   m rectangular table a, each cell of the table contains a zero or a number one. Sereja wants his table to meet the following requirement: each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table. Rectangles should be filled with cells, that is, if a component form a rectangle of size h   w, then the component must contain exactly hw cells. A connected component of the same values is a set of cells of the table that meet the following conditions:  every two cells of the set have the same value;  the cells of the set form a connected region on the table (two cells are connected if they are adjacent in some row or some column of the table);  it is impossible to add any cell to the set unless we violate the two previous conditions.  Can Sereja change the values of at most k cells of the table so that the table met the described requirement  What minimum number of table cells should he change in this case
