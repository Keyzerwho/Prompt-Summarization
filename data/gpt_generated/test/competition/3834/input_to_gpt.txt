On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations: Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or; Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display. Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X. Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.   
tl;dr: You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   

Write a function that gets a sequence and value and returns `true/false` depending on whether the variable exists in a multidimentional sequence. 
tl;dr: Write a function that gets a sequence and value and returns `true` if the variable exists in a multidimentional sequence. 

Sereja has an n   m rectangular table a, each cell of the table contains a zero or a number one. Sereja wants his table to meet the following requirement: each connected component of the same values forms a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of the table. Rectangles should be filled with cells, that is, if a component form a rectangle of size h   w, then the component must contain exactly hw cells. A connected component of the same values is a set of cells of the table that meet the following conditions:  every two cells of the set have the same value;  the cells of the set form a connected region on the table (two cells are connected if they are adjacent in some row or some column of the table);  it is impossible to add any cell to the set unless we violate the two previous conditions.  Can Sereja change the values of at most k cells of the table so that the table met the described requirement  What minimum number of table cells should he change in this case
