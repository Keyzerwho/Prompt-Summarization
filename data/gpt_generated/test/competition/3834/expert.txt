 You are given a table with n rows and m columns. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. You can change the value of at most k cells. Return the minimum number of cells you need to change to meet the requirement. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10). Next n lines describe the table a: the i-th of them contains m integers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im} (0 ≤ a_{i}, j ≤ 1) — the values in the cells of the i-th row. -----Output----- Print -1, if it is impossible to meet the requirement. Otherwise, print the minimum number of cells which should be changed. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 4 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 Output -1 Input 3 4 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 Output 0
