There are $N$ people (numbered $1$ through $N$) standing in a queue to buy icecream from scoORZ. Each person wants to buy exactly one icecream. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th person has one coin with value $a_i$. It is only possible for someone to buy an icecream when Chef can give them back their change exactly   for example, if someone pays with a Rs. 10 coin, Chef needs to have a Rs. 5 coin that he gives to this person as change.
