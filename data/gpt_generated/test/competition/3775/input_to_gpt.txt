The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Now elections are held in Berland and you want to win them. More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you. There are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free. Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \rightarrow {1, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$. Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.

The Bubble Cup hypothesis stood unsolved for $130$ years. Who ever proves the hypothesis will be regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of our time! A famous mathematician Jerry Mao managed to reduce the hypothesis to this problem: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  Help Jerry Mao solve the long standing problem! 
tl;dr: Given a number $m$, how many polynomials $P$ with coefficients in set ${\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}}$ have: $P(2)=m$  

Two participants are each given a pair of distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that there's exactly one number that is present in both pairs. They want to figure out the number that matches by using a communication channel you have access to without revealing it to you. Both participants communicated to each other a set of pairs of numbers, that includes the pair given to them. Each pair in the communicated sets comprises two different numbers. Determine if you can with certainty deduce the common number, or if you can determine with certainty that both participants know the number but you do not.
