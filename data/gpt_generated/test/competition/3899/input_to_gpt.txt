Farmer John has just given the cows a program to play with! The program contains two integer variables, x and y, and performs the following operations on a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} of positive integers:  Initially, x = 1 and y = 0. If, after any step, x   0 or x > n, the program immediately terminates.  The program increases both x and y by a value equal to a_{x} simultaneously.  The program now increases y by a_{x} while decreasing x by a_{x}.  The program executes steps 2 and 3 (first step 2, then step 3) repeatedly until it terminates (it may never terminate). So, the sequence of executed steps may start with: step 2, step 3, step 2, step 3, step 2 and so on.  The cows are not very good at arithmetic though, and they want to see how the program works. Please help them! You are given the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. Suppose for each i (1   i   n - 1) we run the program on the sequence i, a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n}. For each such run output the final value of y if the program terminates or -1 if it does not terminate.

In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible. The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

You need to execute several tasks, each associated with number of processors it needs, and the compute power it will consume. You have sufficient number of analog computers, each with enough processors for any task. Each computer can execute up to one task at a time, and no more than two tasks total. The first task can be any, the second task on each computer must use strictly less power than the first. You will assign between 1 and 2 tasks to each computer. You will then first execute the first task on each computer, wait for all of them to complete, and then execute the second task on each computer that has two tasks assigned. If the average compute power per utilized processor (the sum of all consumed powers for all tasks presently running divided by the number of utilized processors) across all computers exceeds some unknown threshold during the execution of the first tasks, the entire system will blow up. There is no restriction on the second tasks execution. Find the lowest threshold for which it is possible. Due to the specifics of the task, you need to print the answer multiplied by 1000 and rounded up.
