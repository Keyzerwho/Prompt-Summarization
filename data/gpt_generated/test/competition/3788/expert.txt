 Dima the hamster nibbled all the edges of a binary search tree. Andrew, who has been assembling the tree for a long time, will get extremely upset if he sees his creation demolished. Help Dima construct such a binary search tree or determine that it's impossible. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the number of vertices $n$ ($2 \le n \le 700$). The second line features $n$ distinct integers $a_i$ ($2 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the values of vertices in ascending order. -----Output----- If it is possible to reassemble the binary search tree, such that the greatest common divisor of any two vertices connected by the edge is greater than $1$, print "Yes" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, print "No" (quotes for clarity). -----Examples----- Input 6 3 6 9 18 36 108 Output Yes Input 2 7 17 Output No Input 9 4 8 10 12 15 18 33 44 81 Output Yes -----Note----- The picture below illustrates one of the possible trees for the first example.
