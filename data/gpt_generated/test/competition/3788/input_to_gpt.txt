We have a permutation of the integers from 1 through N, p_1, p_2, .., p_N. We also have M pairs of two integers between 1 and N (inclusive), represented as (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), .., (x_M,y_M). AtCoDeer the deer is going to perform the following operation on p as many times as desired so that the number of i (1   i   N) such that p_i = i is maximized:  - Choose j such that 1   j   M, and swap p_{x_j} and p_{y_j}. Find the maximum possible number of i such that p_i = i after operations. -----Constraints-----  - 2   N   10^5  - 1   M   10^5  - p is a permutation of integers from 1 through N.  - 1   x_j,y_j   N  - x_j   y_j  - If i   j, \{x_i,y_i\}   \{x_j,y_j\}.  - All values in input are integers.

Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample. Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed. Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time. Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers. 
tl;dr: There are n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks.  Block is called internal if all its neighbors has each side adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation you can destroy all boundary blocks. Count how many operations you will take to destroy all towers. 

Dima the hamster enjoys nibbling different things: cages, sticks, bad problemsetters and even trees! Recently he found a binary search tree and instinctively nibbled all of its edges, hence messing up the vertices. Dima knows that if Andrew, who has been thoroughly assembling the tree for a long time, comes home and sees his creation demolished, he'll get extremely upset.  To not let that happen, Dima has to recover the binary search tree. Luckily, he noticed that any two vertices connected by a direct edge had their greatest common divisor value exceed $1$. Help Dima construct such a binary search tree or determine that it's impossible. The definition and properties of a binary search tree can be found here.
