Implement a function which  creates a **[radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree)** (a space-optimized trie [prefix tree])  in which each node that is the only child is merged with its parent [unless a word from the input ends there])  from a given list of words  using dictionaries (aka hash maps or hash tables) where: 1. The dictionary keys are the nodes. 2. Leaf nodes are empty dictionaries. 3. The value for empty input is an empty dictionary. 4. Words are all lowercase or empty strings. 5. Words can contain duplicates. ###

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ positive integers. You can use the following operation as many times as you like: select any integer $1 \le k \le n$ and do one of two things:   decrement by one $k$ of the first elements of the array.  decrement by one $k$ of the last elements of the array.  For example, if $n=5$ and $a=[3,2,2,1,4]$, then you can apply one of the following operations to it (not all possible options are listed below):   decrement from the first two elements of the array. After this operation $a=[2, 1, 2, 1, 4]$;  decrement from the last three elements of the array. After this operation $a=[3, 2, 1, 0, 3]$;  decrement from the first five elements of the array. After this operation $a=[2, 1, 1, 0, 3]$;  Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations.

Natasha travels around Mars in the Mars rover. But suddenly it broke down, namely   the logical scheme inside it. The scheme is an undirected tree (connected acyclic graph) with a root in the vertex $1$, in which every leaf (excluding root) is an input, and all other vertices are logical elements, including the root, which is output. One bit is fed to each input. One bit is returned at the output. There are four types of logical elements: AND ($2$ inputs), OR ($2$ inputs), XOR ($2$ inputs), NOT ($1$ input). Logical elements take values from their direct descendants (inputs) and return the result of the function they perform. Natasha knows the logical scheme of the Mars rover, as well as the fact that only one input is broken. In order to fix the Mars rover, she needs to change the value on this input. For each input, determine what the output will be if Natasha changes this input.
