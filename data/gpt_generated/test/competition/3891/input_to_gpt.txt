Cengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named XORinacci numbers. He defined them as follows:   $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. You have to answer for $T$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. 

Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

Konrad is a Human Relations consultant working for VoltModder, a large electrical equipment producer. Today, he has been tasked with evaluating the level of happiness in the company. There are $n$ people working for VoltModder, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each employee earns a different amount of money in the company   initially, the $i$-th person earns $i$ rubles per day. On each of $q$ following days, the salaries will be revised. At the end of the $i$-th day, employee $v_i$ will start earning $n+i$ rubles per day and will become the best-paid person in the company. The employee will keep his new salary until it gets revised again. Some pairs of people don't like each other. This creates a great psychological danger in the company. Formally, if two people $a$ and $b$ dislike each other and $a$ earns more money than $b$, employee $a$ will brag about this to $b$. A dangerous triple is a triple of three employees $a$, $b$ and $c$, such that $a$ brags to $b$, who in turn brags to $c$. If $a$ dislikes $b$, then $b$ dislikes $a$. At the beginning of each day, Konrad needs to evaluate the number of dangerous triples in the company. Can you help him do it  
tl;dr: You have $n$ nodes in a graph. The $i$-th node starts with a value of $i$. The node values will be revised $q$ times. For the $j$-th revision, node $v_i$ will have a value of $n+i$. The node $v_i$ will have this value for the only the $j$-th revision, it will have value $i$ otherwise. Some nodes dislike with each other, if two nodes $a$ and $b$ dislike with each other and $a$ has a higher value than $b$ then $a$ conflicts with $b$. A dangerous triple is three nodes $a$, $b$, $c$ such that $a$ conflicts with $b$ and $b$ conflicts with $c$. You need to find the number of dangerous triples before the revisions and after each revision. 

Consider a table of size $n \times m$, initially fully white. Rows are numbered $1$ through $n$ from top to bottom, columns $1$ through $m$ from left to right. Some square inside the table with odd side length was painted black. Find the center of this square.
