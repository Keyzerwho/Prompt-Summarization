A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph, where an edge can connect any number of vertices. A k-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph such that all its hyperedges have size k. For more information, see Wikipedia. Let's call a particular hypergraph a hypertree if it is connected (that is, you can move from any vertex to any other vertex using only its hyperedges) and removing any of its hyperedges makes the hypergraph disconnected (note that this definition of hypertrees differs from the standard one). Given just one integer N, find the number of 3-uniform hypertrees on N vertices. Two 3-uniform hypertrees are considered different if a hyperedge (u, v, w) exists such that it is present in exactly one of these hypertrees (note that the order of vertices in the hyperedge doesn't matter, and neither does the order of hyperedges in the hypertree). 
tl;dr: Given an integer N, find the number of 3-uniform hypertrees on N vertices. Two 3-uniform hypertrees are considered different if a hyperedge (u, v, w) exists such that it is present in exactly one of these hypertrees. 

You are given a string s of length n. Does a tree with n vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., n.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., n-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - If the i-th character in s is 1, we can have a connected component of size i by removing one edge from the tree.  - If the i-th character in s is 0, we cannot have a connected component of size i by removing any one edge from the tree. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq n \leq 10^5  - s is a string of length n consisting of 0 and 1.

Mikhail the Freelancer dreams of two things: to become a cool programmer and to buy a flat in Moscow. To become a cool programmer, he needs at least p experience points, and a desired flat in Moscow costs q dollars. Mikhail is determined to follow his dreams and registered at a freelance site. He has suggestions to work on n distinct projects. Mikhail has already evaluated that the participation in the i-th project will increase his experience by a_{i} per day and bring b_{i} dollars per day. As freelance work implies flexible working hours, Mikhail is free to stop working on one project at any time and start working on another project. Doing so, he receives the respective share of experience and money. Mikhail is only trying to become a cool programmer, so he is able to work only on one project at any moment of time. Find the real value, equal to the minimum number of days Mikhail needs to make his dream come true. For example, suppose Mikhail is suggested to work on three projects and a_1 = 6, b_1 = 2, a_2 = 1, b_2 = 3, a_3 = 2, b_3 = 6. Also, p = 20 and q = 20. In order to achieve his aims Mikhail has to work for 2.5 days on both first and third projects. Indeed, a_1 2.5 + a_2 0 + a_3 2.5 = 6 2.5 + 1 0 + 2 2.5 = 20 and b_1 2.5 + b_2 0 + b_3 2.5 = 2 2.5 + 3 0 + 6 2.5 = 20.
