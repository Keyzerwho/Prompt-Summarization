 You are given a line of length $n$ and you want to divide it into several non-empty sections. The value of $i$-th element is $a_i$. You want to generate the maximum number of sections from the list. There is a restriction for each section: the number of values in the section multiplied by the minimum value among all values in the section must be at least $x$. Each value should belong to at most one section. Some value may be left without being part of any section. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, n ≥ m), the number of plants and the number of different species. Each of the following n lines contain two space-separated numbers: one integer number s_{i} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ m), and one real number x_{i} (0 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9), the species and position of the i-th plant. Each x_{i} will contain no more than 6 digits after the decimal point. It is guaranteed that all x_{i} are different; there is at least one plant of each species; the plants are given in order "from left to the right", that is in the ascending order of their x_{i} coordinates (x_{i} < x_{i} + 1, 1 ≤ i < n). -----Output----- Output a single integer — the minimum number of plants to be replanted. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 2 1 1 2.0 1 3.100 Output 1 Input 3 3 1 5.0 2 5.5 3 6.0 Output 0 Input 6 3 1 14.284235 2 17.921382 1 20.328172 3 20.842331 1 25.790145 1 27.204125 Output 2 -----Note----- In the first test case, Emuskald can replant the first plant to the right of the last plant, so the answer is 1. In the second test case, the species are already in the correct order, so no replanting is needed.
