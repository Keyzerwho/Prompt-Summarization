Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

There are $n$ programmers that you want to split into several non-empty teams. The skill of the $i$-th programmer is $a_i$. You want to assemble the maximum number of teams from them. There is a restriction for each team: the number of programmers in the team multiplied by the minimum skill among all programmers in the team must be at least $x$. Each programmer should belong to at most one team. Some programmers may be left without a team. Calculate the maximum number of teams that you can assemble. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of length $n$ and you want to split it into several non-empty sets. The value of $i$-th element is $a_i$. You want to generate the maximum number of sets from the list. There is a restriction for each set: the number of values in the team multiplied by the minimum value among all values in the team must be at least $x$. Each value should belong to at most one set. Some value may be left without being part of any set. 

Emuskald is an avid horticulturist and owns the world's longest greenhouse   it is effectively infinite in length. Over the years Emuskald has cultivated n plants in his greenhouse, of m different plant species numbered from 1 to m. His greenhouse is very narrow and can be viewed as an infinite line, with each plant occupying a single point on that line. Emuskald has discovered that each species thrives at a different temperature, so he wants to arrange m - 1 borders that would divide the greenhouse into m sections numbered from 1 to m from left to right with each section housing a single species. He is free to place the borders, but in the end all of the i-th species plants must reside in i-th section from the left. Of course, it is not always possible to place the borders in such way, so Emuskald needs to replant some of his plants. He can remove each plant from its position and place it anywhere in the greenhouse (at any real coordinate) with no plant already in it. Since replanting is a lot of stress for the plants, help Emuskald find the minimum number of plants he has to replant to be able to place the borders.
