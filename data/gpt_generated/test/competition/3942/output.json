There was a string s written on the door consisting of characters '(', ')' and '#'. Below there was a manual on how to open the door. After spending a long time Malek managed to decode the manual and found out that the goal is to replace each '#' with one or more ')' characters so that the final string becomes beautiful. Below there was also written that a string is called beautiful if for each i (1   i   |s|) there are no more ')' characters than '(' characters among the first i characters of s and also the total number of '(' characters is equal to the total number of ')' characters. Help Malek open the door by telling him for each '#' character how many ')' characters he must replace it with.",
