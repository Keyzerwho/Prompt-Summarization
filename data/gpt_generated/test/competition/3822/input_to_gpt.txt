Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path. You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.

# Task Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence. Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.  ## Input * sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.  For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`)

On vacations n pupils decided to go on excursion and gather all together. They need to overcome the path with the length l meters. Each of the pupils will go with the speed equal to v_1. To get to the excursion quickly, it was decided to rent a bus, which has seats for k people (it means that it can't fit more than k people at the same time) and the speed equal to v_2. In order to avoid seasick, each of the pupils want to get into the bus no more than once. Determine the minimum time required for all n pupils to reach the place of excursion. Consider that the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, as well as the reversal of the bus, take place immediately and this time can be neglected.
