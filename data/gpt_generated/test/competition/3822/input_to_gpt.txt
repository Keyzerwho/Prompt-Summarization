You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.   Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   
tl;dr: You have to apply + and - symbol between the given list non-negative integers to achieve the target S. In how many ways are there to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   

The Jones Trucking Company tracks the location of each of its trucks on a grid similar to an (x, y) plane. The home office is at the location (0, 0). Read the coordinates of truck A and the coordinates of truck B and determine which is closer to the office. 
tl;dr: Print the point name which is closer to point P(0,0) by calculating distance from other given points. 

You have the `radius` of a circle with the center in point `(0,0)`. Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where `(x,y)` - the cartesian coordinates of the points - are `integers`. 
tl;dr: You have the radius of a circle with the center in point (0,0). Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where (x,y) are integers.  0 <= radius <= 1000. 

On vacations n pupils decided to go on excursion and gather all together. They need to overcome the path with the length l meters. Each of the pupils will go with the speed equal to v_1. To get to the excursion quickly, it was decided to rent a bus, which has seats for k people (it means that it can't fit more than k people at the same time) and the speed equal to v_2. In order to avoid seasick, each of the pupils want to get into the bus no more than once. Determine the minimum time required for all n pupils to reach the place of excursion. Consider that the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, as well as the reversal of the bus, take place immediately and this time can be neglected.  
tl;dr:
