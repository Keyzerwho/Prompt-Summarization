Write a function that takes an integer and returns an array `[A, B, C]`, where `A` is the number of multiples of 3 (but not 5) below the given integer, `B` is the number of multiples of 5 (but not 3) below the given integer and `C` is the number of multiples of 3 and 5 below the given integer.  For example, `solution(20)` should return `[5, 2, 1]` ~~~if:r ```r # in R, returns a numeric vector solution(20) [1] 5 2 1 class(solution(20)) [1] "numeric" ``` ~~
tl;dr: Write a function that takes an integer and returns an array [A, B, C], where A is the number of multiples of 3 below the given integer, B is the number of multiples of 5 below the given integer and C is the number of multiples of 3 and 5 below the given integer.  

Given an array of integers. Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. If the input array is empty or null, return an empty array. #

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed. n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 
tl;dr: You are given a total of n coins to form staircase rows where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   The output should be the total number of such rows formed. n>=0 and has the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 

A monster is attacking the Cyberland! Master Yang, a braver, is going to beat the monster. Yang and the monster each have 3 attributes: hitpoints (HP), offensive power (ATK) and defensive power (DEF). During the battle, every second the monster's HP decrease by max(0, ATK_{Y} - DEF_{M}), while Yang's HP decreases by max(0, ATK_{M} - DEF_{Y}), where index Y denotes Master Yang and index M denotes monster. Both decreases happen simultaneously Once monster's HP   0 and the same time Master Yang's HP > 0, Master Yang wins. Master Yang can buy attributes from the magic shop of Cyberland: h bitcoins per HP, a bitcoins per ATK, and d bitcoins per DEF. Now Master Yang wants to know the minimum number of bitcoins he can spend in order to win.
