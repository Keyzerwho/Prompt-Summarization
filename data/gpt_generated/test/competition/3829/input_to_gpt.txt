-----Problem description.----- This problem deals with the I/O methods used in codechef.  You are supposed to print the integer in its reverse form , or in simple words, print the reverse of the given integer . For instance , reverse of  120 is 21  (not 021)  . 
tl;dr: Print the reverse of the given integer.(0 is not allowed in starting). 

You are given $n$ arrays that can have different sizes. You also have a table with $w$ columns and $n$ rows. The $i$-th array is placed horizontally in the $i$-th row. You can slide each array within its row as long as it occupies several consecutive cells and lies completely inside the table. You need to find the maximum sum of the integers in the $j$-th column for each $j$ from $1$ to $w$ independently.  [Image] Optimal placements for columns $1$, $2$ and $3$ are shown on the pictures from left to right.  Note that you can exclude any array out of a column provided it remains in the window. In this case its value is considered to be zero.

Twilight Sparkle was playing Ludo with her friends Rainbow Dash, Apple Jack and Flutter Shy. But she kept losing. Having returned to the castle, Twilight Sparkle became interested in the dice that were used in the game. The dice has m faces: the first face of the dice contains a dot, the second one contains two dots, and so on, the m-th face contains m dots. Twilight Sparkle is sure that when the dice is tossed, each face appears with probability $\frac{1}{m}$. Also she knows that each toss is independent from others. Help her to calculate the expected maximum number of dots she could get after tossing the dice n times.
