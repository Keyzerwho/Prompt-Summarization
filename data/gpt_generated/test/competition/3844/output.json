            "text": " Edogawa Conan got tired of solving cases, and invited his friend, Professor Agasa, over. They decided to play a game of cards. Conan has n cards, and the i-th card has a number a_{i} written on it. They take turns playing, starting with Conan. In each turn, the player chooses a card and removes it. Also, he removes all cards having a number strictly lesser than the number on the chosen card. Formally, if the player chooses the i-th card, he removes that card and removes the j-th card for all j such that a_{j} < a_{i}. A player loses if he cannot make a move on his turn, that is, he loses if there are no cards left. Predict the outcome of the game, assuming both players play optimally. ",
