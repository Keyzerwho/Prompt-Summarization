Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion  Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. 
tl;dr: You have to shuffle digits of the given proportion(x : y :: z : w) in order to check that is it possible to make new proportion or not. 

Little X has n distinct integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. He wants to divide all of them into two sets A and B. The following two conditions must be satisfied:  If number x belongs to set A, then number a - x must also belong to set A.  If number x belongs to set B, then number b - x must also belong to set B.  Help Little X divide the numbers into two sets or determine that it's impossible.

Edogawa Conan got tired of solving cases, and invited his friend, Professor Agasa, over. They decided to play a game of cards. Conan has n cards, and the i-th card has a number a_{i} written on it. They take turns playing, starting with Conan. In each turn, the player chooses a card and removes it. Also, he removes all cards having a number strictly lesser than the number on the chosen card. Formally, if the player chooses the i-th card, he removes that card and removes the j-th card for all j such that a_{j} < a_{i}. A player loses if he cannot make a move on his turn, that is, he loses if there are no cards left. Predict the outcome of the game, assuming both players play optimally.
