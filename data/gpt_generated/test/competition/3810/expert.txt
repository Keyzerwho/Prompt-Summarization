 You are given an array of numbers. Make sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 60$), denoting the number of boxes. The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 60$), where $a_i$ is the label of the $i$-th box. -----Output----- Print the number of distinct piles having the maximum number of boxes that ROBO_Head can have, modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 6 8 Output 2 Input 5 2 3 4 9 12 Output 4 Input 4 5 7 2 9 Output 1 -----Note----- Let's illustrate the box pile as a sequence $b$, with the pile's bottommost box being at the leftmost position. In the first example, there are $2$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [6]$ ($[2, \mathbf{6}, 8] \xrightarrow{(1, 3, 2)} [2, 8]$)  $b = [8]$ ($[2, 6, \mathbf{8}] \xrightarrow{(1, 2, 3)} [2, 6]$)  In the second example, there are $4$ distinct piles possible:   $b = [9, 12]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, 4, \mathbf{12}] \xrightarrow{(1, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 4]$)  $b = [4, 12]$ ($[2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, 9, \mathbf{12}] \xrightarrow{(2, 3, 4)} [2, 3, 9]$)  $b = [4, 9]$ ($[2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 9, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 5, 3)} [2, 3, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$)  $b = [9, 4]$ ($[2, 3, 4, \mathbf{9}, 12] \xrightarrow{(2, 5, 4)} [2, 3, \mathbf{4}, 12] \xrightarrow{(1, 4, 3)} [2, 3, 12]$)  In the third sequence, ROBO can do nothing at all. Therefore, there is only $1$ valid pile, and that pile is empty.
