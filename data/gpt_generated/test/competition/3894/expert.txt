 Given a sequence of numbers, find the winner of a game of Lieges of Legendre. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The second line contains n integers, a_1, a_2, ... a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) describing the initial state of the game.  -----Output----- Output the name of the winning player, either "Kevin" or "Nicky" (without quotes). -----Examples----- Input 2 1 3 4 Output Kevin Input 1 2 3 Output Nicky -----Note----- In the second sample, Nicky can win in the following way: Kevin moves first and is forced to remove a cow, so the pile contains two cows after his move. Next, Nicky replaces this pile of size 2 with two piles of size 1. So the game state is now two piles of size 1. Kevin then removes one of the remaining cows and Nicky wins by removing the other.
