You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane.  Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.   
tl;dr: you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 

Given a permutation $p$ of length $n$, find its subsequence $s_1$, $s_2$, $\ldots$, $s_k$ of length at least $2$ such that:  $|s_1-s_2|+|s_2-s_3|+\ldots+|s_{k-1}-s_k|$ is as big as possible over all subsequences of $p$ with length at least $2$.  Among all such subsequences, choose the one whose length, $k$, is as small as possible.  If multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them. A sequence $a$ is a subsequence of an array $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deleting some (possibly, zero or all) elements. A permutation of length $n$ is an array of length $n$ in which every element from $1$ to $n$ occurs exactly once.

Dhruvil has always been a studious person and will be completing his Engineering soon. He is always kneen about solving problems and is preparing hard for his next interview at Hackerrank. He has practiced lots of problems and now he came across this problem. Given a message containing English letters(A-Z), it is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1,'B' -> 2        'Z' -> 26. Now, given a non-empty string containing only digits, help Dhruvil determine the total number of ways to decode it. While decoding you need to choose a substring of charachters and not a subsequence. Also a chosen substring should not contain any leading "0"s, but can contain trailing "0"s. Since the output can be very large print the answer as modulo 10^9 + 7 i.e 1000000007.

Kevin and Nicky Sun have invented a new game called Lieges of Legendre. In this game, two players take turns modifying the game state with Kevin moving first. Initially, the game is set up so that there are n piles of cows, with the i-th pile containing a_{i} cows. During each player's turn, that player calls upon the power of Sunlight, and uses it to either:   Remove a single cow from a chosen non-empty pile.  Choose a pile of cows with even size 2 x (x > 0), and replace it with k piles of x cows each.  The player who removes the last cow wins. Given n, k, and a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, help Kevin and Nicky find the winner, given that both sides play in optimal way.
