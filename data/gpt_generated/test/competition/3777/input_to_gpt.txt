An array of integers $p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n}$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$. There is a hidden permutation of length $n$. For each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element. Your task is to restore the permutation.

Andrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type "d_{i}   t_{i}", that means "replace all digits d_{i} in string s with substrings equal to t_{i}". For example, if s = 123123, then query "2   00" transforms s to 10031003, and query "3   " meaning "replace 3 by an empty string" transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero. Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!

We have an undirected weighted graph with N vertices and M edges. The i-th edge in the graph connects Vertex U_i and Vertex V_i, and has a weight of W_i. Additionally, you are given an integer X. Find the number of ways to paint each edge in this graph either white or black such that the following condition is met, modulo 10^9 + 7:  - The graph has a spanning tree that contains both an edge painted white and an edge painted black. Furthermore, among such spanning trees, the one with the smallest weight has a weight of X. Here, the weight of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of the edges contained in the spanning tree. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 1 000  - 1 \leq M \leq 2 000  - 1 \leq U_i, V_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)  - 1 \leq W_i \leq 10^9 (1 \leq i \leq M)  - If i \neq j, then (U_i, V_i) \neq (U_j, V_j) and (U_i, V_i) \neq (V_j, U_j).  - U_i \neq V_i (1 \leq i \leq M)  - The given graph is connected.  - 1 \leq X \leq 10^{12}  - All input values are integers.
