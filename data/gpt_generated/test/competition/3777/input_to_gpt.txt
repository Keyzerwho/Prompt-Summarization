Andrew and Eugene are playing a game. Initially, Andrew has string s, consisting of digits. Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type "d_{i}   t_{i}", that means "replace all digits d_{i} in string s with substrings equal to t_{i}". For example, if s = 123123, then query "2   00" transforms s to 10031003, and query "3   " meaning "replace 3 by an empty string" transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero. Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!

**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #16 Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the **first** not repeated character in the entire string. ``` haskell noRepeat "aabbccdde" `shouldBe` 'e' noRepeat "wxyz"      `shouldBe` 'w' noRepeat "testing"   `shouldBe` 'e' ``` 
tl;dr: Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the first not repeated character in the entire string. 

Sumit and Dhiraj are roommates in a hostel of NIT Jamshedpur,One day after completing there boring assignments of Artificial Intelligence, they decided to play a game as it was dhiraj,s idea to play a game so he started explaining the rules of the game to sumit. So the game was as follows-They randomly took a number N after that they find all its divisors.Suppose first sumit took a divisor then dhiraj and so on.The player who will be having the last divisor with him will win the game.Rohit their mutual friend,was observing them play. Can you help Rohit predict the outcome of game  If Sumit wins print "YES" without quotes and "NO" without quotes, if Dhiraj wins the game. 
tl;dr: Given a number N, return YES if it has an even number of positive divisors, NO otherwise. 

We have an undirected weighted graph with N vertices and M edges. The i-th edge in the graph connects Vertex U_i and Vertex V_i, and has a weight of W_i. Additionally, you are given an integer X. Find the number of ways to paint each edge in this graph either white or black such that the following condition is met, modulo 10^9 + 7:  - The graph has a spanning tree that contains both an edge painted white and an edge painted black. Furthermore, among such spanning trees, the one with the smallest weight has a weight of X. Here, the weight of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of the edges contained in the spanning tree. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 1 000  - 1 \leq M \leq 2 000  - 1 \leq U_i, V_i \leq N (1 \leq i \leq M)  - 1 \leq W_i \leq 10^9 (1 \leq i \leq M)  - If i \neq j, then (U_i, V_i) \neq (U_j, V_j) and (U_i, V_i) \neq (V_j, U_j).  - U_i \neq V_i (1 \leq i \leq M)  - The given graph is connected.  - 1 \leq X \leq 10^{12}  - All input values are integers.
