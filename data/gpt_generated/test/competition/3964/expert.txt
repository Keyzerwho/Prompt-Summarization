 Programmers working on a large project have just received a task to write exactly m lines of code. There are n programmers working on a project, the i-th of them makes exactly a_{i} bugs in every line of code that he writes. 

-----Input----- The first line contains four integers n, m, b, mod (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, 0 ≤ b ≤ 500; 1 ≤ mod ≤ 10^9 + 7) — the number of programmers, the number of lines of code in the task, the maximum total number of bugs respectively and the modulo you should use when printing the answer. The next line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 500) — the number of bugs per line for each programmer. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo mod. -----Examples----- Input 3 3 3 100 1 1 1 Output 10 Input 3 6 5 1000000007 1 2 3 Output 0 Input 3 5 6 11 1 2 1 Output 0
