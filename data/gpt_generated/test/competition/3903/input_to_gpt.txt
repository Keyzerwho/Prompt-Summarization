You are given two integer sequences, each of length N: a_1, ..., a_N and b_1, ..., b_N. There are N^2 ways to choose two integers i and j such that 1 \leq i, j \leq N. For each of these N^2 pairs, we will compute a_i + b_j and write it on a sheet of paper. That is, we will write N^2 integers in total. Compute the XOR of these N^2 integers. Definition of XOR The XOR of integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_m is defined as follows:  - Let the XOR be X. In the binary representation of X, the digit in the 2^k's place (0 \leq k; k is an integer) is 1 if there are an odd number of integers among c_1, c_2, ...c_m whose binary representation has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 if that number is even. For example, let us compute the XOR of 3 and 5. The binary representation of 3 is 011, and the binary representation of 5 is 101, thus the XOR has the binary representation 110, that is, the XOR is 6. -----Constraints-----  - All input values are integers.  - 1 \leq N \leq 200,000  - 0 \leq a_i, b_i < 2^{28}

Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order. Iroha is looking for X,Y,Z-Haiku (defined below) in integer sequences. Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku  Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0   x < y < z < w   N) such that all of the following are satisfied:  - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X  - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y  - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Since the answer can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 3   N   40  - 1   X   5  - 1   Y   7  - 1   Z   5

A transaction is possibly invalid if: the amount exceeds $1000, or; if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city. Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction. Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.   
tl;dr: You are given a list of strings where each string in format of "A,B,C,D". where A,D are strings and B,C are numbers. A string is possibly invalid if: the C exceeds 1000, or; if two strings have same A and different D and the difference between C is greater than or equal to 60. return list of strings which are possibley invalid in any order 

The famous global economic crisis is approaching rapidly, so the states of Berman, Berance and Bertaly formed an alliance and allowed the residents of all member states to freely pass through the territory of any of them. In addition, it was decided that a road between the states should be built to guarantee so that one could any point of any country can be reached from any point of any other State. Since roads are always expensive, the governments of the states of the newly formed alliance asked you to help them assess the costs. To do this, you have been issued a map that can be represented as a rectangle table consisting of n rows and m columns. Any cell of the map either belongs to one of three states, or is an area where it is allowed to build a road, or is an area where the construction of the road is not allowed. A cell is called passable, if it belongs to one of the states, or the road was built in this cell. From any passable cells you can move up, down, right and left, if the cell that corresponds to the movement exists and is passable. Your task is to construct a road inside a minimum number of cells, so that it would be possible to get from any cell of any state to any cell of any other state using only passable cells. It is guaranteed that initially it is possible to reach any cell of any state from any cell of this state, moving only along its cells. It is also guaranteed that for any state there is at least one cell that belongs to it.
