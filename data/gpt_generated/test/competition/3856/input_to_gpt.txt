Little X has n distinct integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. He wants to divide all of them into two sets A and B. The following two conditions must be satisfied:  If number x belongs to set A, then number a - x must also belong to set A.  If number x belongs to set B, then number b - x must also belong to set B.  Help Little X divide the numbers into two sets or determine that it's impossible. 
tl;dr: You have n distinct integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. You want to divide all of them into two sets A and B. The following two conditions must be satisfied:  If number x belongs to set A, then number a - x must also belong to set A.  If number x belongs to set B, then number b - x must also belong to set B.  Divide the numbers into two sets or determine that it's impossible. 

Many years have passed, and n friends met at a party again. Technologies have leaped forward since the last meeting, cameras with timer appeared and now it is not obligatory for one of the friends to stand with a camera, and, thus, being absent on the photo. Simply speaking, the process of photographing can be described as follows. Each friend occupies a rectangle of pixels on the photo: the i-th of them in a standing state occupies a w_{i} pixels wide and a h_{i} pixels high rectangle. But also, each person can lie down for the photo, and then he will occupy a h_{i} pixels wide and a w_{i} pixels high rectangle. The total photo will have size W   H, where W is the total width of all the people rectangles, and H is the maximum of the heights. The friends want to determine what minimum area the group photo can they obtain if no more than n / 2 of them can lie on the ground (it would be strange if more than n / 2 gentlemen lie on the ground together, isn't it ..) Help them to achieve this goal.
