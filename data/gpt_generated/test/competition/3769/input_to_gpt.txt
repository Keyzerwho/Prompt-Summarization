You are given a graph with $3 \cdot n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You are to find a matching of $n$ edges, or an independent set of $n$ vertices. A set of edges is called a matching if no two edges share an endpoint. A set of vertices is called an independent set if no two vertices are connected with an edge.

There are N bags, each containing two white balls. The i-th box contains two balls with integers x_i and y_i written on them, respectively. For each of these bags, you will paint one of the balls red, and paint the other blue. Afterwards, the 2N balls will be classified according to color. Then, we will define the following:  - R_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in red  - R_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in red  - B_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in blue  - B_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in blue Find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) \times (B_{max} - B_{min}). -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   200,000  - 1   x_i, y_i   10^9

Mr. Das is a teacher teaching for several years in a school. He is not computer savvy. Due to lockdown, now he has to take classes online. Recently he took an online exam for students of different classes. Now, he will call parents of all the students who scored lower than average marks for the class. He has requested you to give the name $X$, parent's phone number $P$, and marks obtained $M$ to him. 
tl;dr: You are given n students with their name, parent's phonenumber and marks of a class.Find all the students who scored lower than average marks for the class.  

As behooves any intelligent schoolboy, Kevin Sun is studying psycowlogy, cowculus, and cryptcowgraphy at the Bovinia State University (BGU) under Farmer Ivan. During his Mathematics of Olympiads (MoO) class, Kevin was confronted with a weird functional equation and needs your help. For two fixed integers k and p, where p is an odd prime number, the functional equation states that $f(k x \operatorname{mod} p) \equiv k \cdot f(x) \operatorname{mod} p$  for some function $f : \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \} \rightarrow \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \}$. (This equation should hold for any integer x in the range 0 to p - 1, inclusive.) It turns out that f can actually be many different functions. Instead of finding a solution, Kevin wants you to count the number of distinct functions f that satisfy this equation. Since the answer may be very large, you should print your result modulo 10^9 + 7.
