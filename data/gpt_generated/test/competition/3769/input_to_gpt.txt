There are n cards of different colours placed in a line, each of them can be either red, green or blue cards. Count the minimum number of cards to withdraw from the line so that no two adjacent cards have the same colour. 
tl;dr: You are given n cards of 3 different colours placed in a line. Count the minimum number of cards to withdraw from the line so that no two adjacent cards have the same colour. 

You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges. You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct all undirected edges. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 

As behooves any intelligent schoolboy, Kevin Sun is studying psycowlogy, cowculus, and cryptcowgraphy at the Bovinia State University (BGU) under Farmer Ivan. During his Mathematics of Olympiads (MoO) class, Kevin was confronted with a weird functional equation and needs your help. For two fixed integers k and p, where p is an odd prime number, the functional equation states that $f(k x \operatorname{mod} p) \equiv k \cdot f(x) \operatorname{mod} p$  for some function $f : \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \} \rightarrow \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \}$. (This equation should hold for any integer x in the range 0 to p - 1, inclusive.) It turns out that f can actually be many different functions. Instead of finding a solution, Kevin wants you to count the number of distinct functions f that satisfy this equation. Since the answer may be very large, you should print your result modulo 10^9 + 7.
