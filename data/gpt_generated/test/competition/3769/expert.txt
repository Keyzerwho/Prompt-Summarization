 You are given a function $f : \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \} \rightarrow \{0,1,2, \cdots, p - 1 \}$. Find the number of distinct functions $f$ that satisfy the equation $f(k x \operatorname{mod} p) \equiv k \cdot f(x) \operatorname{mod} p$ for all integers x in the range 0 to p - 1, inclusive. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two space-separated integers p and k (3 ≤ p ≤ 1 000 000, 0 ≤ k ≤ p - 1) on a single line. It is guaranteed that p is an odd prime number. -----Output----- Print a single integer, the number of distinct functions f modulo 10^9 + 7. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 Output 3 Input 5 4 Output 25 -----Note----- In the first sample, p = 3 and k = 2. The following functions work:   f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2.  f(0) = 0, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 1.  f(0) = f(1) = f(2) = 0.
