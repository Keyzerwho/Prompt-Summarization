Sereja wants to build a beautiful array a, consisting of n integers. But not everything is so easy, Sereja's friend Dima has m coupons, each contains two integers q_{i}, w_{i}. Coupon i costs w_{i} and allows you to use as many numbers q_{i} as you want when constructing the array a. Values q_{i} are distinct. Sereja has no coupons, so Dima and Sereja have made the following deal. Dima builds some beautiful array a of n elements. After that he takes w_{i} rubles from Sereja for each q_{i}, which occurs in the array a. Sereja believed his friend and agreed to the contract, and now he is wondering, what is the maximum amount of money he can pay. Help Sereja, find the maximum amount of money he can pay to Dima. ",
