You are given several queries. Each query consists of three integers $p$, $q$ and $b$. You need to answer whether the result of $p/q$ in notation with base $b$ is a finite fraction. A fraction in notation with base $b$ is finite if it contains finite number of numerals after the decimal point. It is also possible that a fraction has zero numerals after the decimal point.

Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

Let's call an array consisting of n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, beautiful if it has the following property:   consider all pairs of numbers x, y (x   y), such that number x occurs in the array a and number y occurs in the array a;  for each pair x, y must exist some position j (1   j < n), such that at least one of the two conditions are met, either a_{j} = x, a_{j} + 1 = y, or a_{j} = y, a_{j} + 1 = x.  Sereja wants to build a beautiful array a, consisting of n integers. But not everything is so easy, Sereja's friend Dima has m coupons, each contains two integers q_{i}, w_{i}. Coupon i costs w_{i} and allows you to use as many numbers q_{i} as you want when constructing the array a. Values q_{i} are distinct. Sereja has no coupons, so Dima and Sereja have made the following deal. Dima builds some beautiful array a of n elements. After that he takes w_{i} rubles from Sereja for each q_{i}, which occurs in the array a. Sereja believed his friend and agreed to the contract, and now he is wondering, what is the maximum amount of money he can pay. Help Sereja, find the maximum amount of money he can pay to Dima.
