Simple transposition is a basic and simple cryptography technique. We make 2 rows and put first a letter in the Row 1, the second in the Row 2, third in Row 1 and so on until the end. Then we put the text from Row 2 next to the Row 1 text and thats it. Complete the function that receives a string and encrypt it with this simple transposition. ##

You have the `radius` of a circle with the center in point `(0,0)`. Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where `(x,y)` - the cartesian coordinates of the points - are `integers`. 
tl;dr: You have the radius of a circle with the center in point (0,0). Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where (x,y) are integers.  0 <= radius <= 1000. 

A simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1 
tl;dr: You have find out the frequency of letters in a given string and print it as the new string which comprises of the letter followed by its frequency.For example string is- abcdabf. Then the new string is- a2b2c1d1f1 

Let's call an array consisting of n integer numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, beautiful if it has the following property:   consider all pairs of numbers x, y (x   y), such that number x occurs in the array a and number y occurs in the array a;  for each pair x, y must exist some position j (1   j < n), such that at least one of the two conditions are met, either a_{j} = x, a_{j} + 1 = y, or a_{j} = y, a_{j} + 1 = x.  Sereja wants to build a beautiful array a, consisting of n integers. But not everything is so easy, Sereja's friend Dima has m coupons, each contains two integers q_{i}, w_{i}. Coupon i costs w_{i} and allows you to use as many numbers q_{i} as you want when constructing the array a. Values q_{i} are distinct. Sereja has no coupons, so Dima and Sereja have made the following deal. Dima builds some beautiful array a of n elements. After that he takes w_{i} rubles from Sereja for each q_{i}, which occurs in the array a. Sereja believed his friend and agreed to the contract, and now he is wondering, what is the maximum amount of money he can pay. Help Sereja, find the maximum amount of money he can pay to Dima.
