 You have to find out the maximum amount of money Sereja can pay to Dima. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^6, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Next m lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains numbers q_{i}, w_{i} (1 ≤ q_{i}, w_{i} ≤ 10^5). It is guaranteed that all q_{i} are distinct. -----Output----- In a single line print maximum amount of money (in rubles) Sereja can pay. Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 1 2 2 3 Output 5 Input 100 3 1 2 2 1 3 1 Output 4 Input 1 2 1 1 2 100 Output 100 -----Note----- In the first sample Sereja can pay 5 rubles, for example, if Dima constructs the following array: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]. There are another optimal arrays for this test. In the third sample Sereja can pay 100 rubles, if Dima constructs the following array: [2].
