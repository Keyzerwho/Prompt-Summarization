Each bag can contain up to $k$ units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day. Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given $n$ days.
