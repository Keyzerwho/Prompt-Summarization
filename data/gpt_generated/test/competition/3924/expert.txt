 You are given a sequence of integers $a_i$ and a number $k$, you are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given $n$ days. No garbage should be left after the $n$-th day. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le k \le 10^9$) — number of days to consider and bag's capacity. The second line contains $n$ space separated integers $a_i$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the number of units of garbage produced on the $i$-th day. -----Output----- Output a single integer — the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all garbage. Each unit of garbage should be disposed on the day it was produced or on the next day. No garbage can be left after the $n$-th day. In a day it is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 3 2 1 Output 3 Input 5 1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 Output 5000000000 Input 3 2 1 0 1 Output 2 Input 4 4 2 8 4 1 Output 4
