Numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots n$ (each integer from $1$ to $n$ once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the board and write one integer $\frac{a + b}{2}$ rounded up instead. You should perform the given operation $n - 1$ times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.  For example, if $n = 4$, the following course of action is optimal:  choose $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3, 3]$;  choose $a = 3$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3]$;  choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $2$, and the whiteboard contains $[2]$.  It's easy to see that after $n - 1$ operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.

# Story Due to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face. And because the local council has lost most of our tax money to a Nigerian email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly.  Instead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand! What a bunch of cheapskates! Can you do it  # Kata Given the ```angle``` (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format. Round _down_ to the nearest minute. # 
tl;dr: Given the angle of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format and round down to the nearest minute. 0 <= angle <= 360 # 

Enough is enough. Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it. For each of next $n$ days Vasya knows $a_i$   number of units of garbage he will produce on the $i$-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to $k$ units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day. Being economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given $n$ days. No garbage should be left after the $n$-th day.
