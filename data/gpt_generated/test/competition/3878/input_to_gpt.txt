The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other. Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both  Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others        Explanation Self-Explanator

Arseny likes to organize parties and invite people to it. However, not only friends come to his parties, but friends of his friends, friends of friends of his friends and so on.
