The "BerCorp" company has got n employees. These employees can use m approved official languages for the formal correspondence. The languages are numbered with integers from 1 to m. For each employee we have the list of languages, which he knows. This list could be empty, i. e. an employee may know no official languages. But the employees are willing to learn any number of official languages, as long as the company pays their lessons. A study course in one language for one employee costs 1 berdollar. Find the minimum sum of money the company needs to spend so as any employee could correspond to any other one (their correspondence can be indirect, i. e. other employees can help out translating). 
tl;dr: You are given n sets which are a subset of the set of natural numbers in the range 1 to m. You can add a single number to any one set at the cost 1. Find the minimum total cost such that for every pair of sets the union is not a null set. 

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value  If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

Toad Pimple has an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. We say that $y$ is reachable from $x$ if $x<y$ and there exists an integer array $p$ such that $x = p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_k=y$, and $a_{p_i}\, \&\, a_{p_{i+1}} > 0$ for all integers $i$ such that $1 \leq i < k$. Here $\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. You are given $q$ pairs of indices, check reachability for each of them.

Arseny likes to organize parties and invite people to it. However, not only friends come to his parties, but friends of his friends, friends of friends of his friends and so on. That's why some of Arseny's guests can be unknown to him. He decided to fix this issue using the following procedure. At each step he selects one of his guests A, who pairwise introduces all of his friends to each other. After this action any two friends of A become friends. This process is run until all pairs of guests are friends. Arseny doesn't want to spend much time doing it, so he wants to finish this process using the minimum number of steps. Help Arseny to do it.
