That's why some of Arseny's guests can be unknown to him. He decided to fix this issue using the following procedure. At each step he selects one of his guests A, who pairwise introduces all of his friends to each other. After this action any two friends of A become friends. This process is run until all pairs of guests are friends. Arseny doesn't want to spend much time doing it, so he wants to finish this process using the minimum number of steps. Help Arseny to do it.
