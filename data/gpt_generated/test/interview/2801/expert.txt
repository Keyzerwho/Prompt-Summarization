 You are given a sequence of numbers $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ and a sequence of pizza stalls $s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_{n-1}$. Margriet wants to visit all the stalls, but she can only eat two pizzas in total. Therefore, she decides to eat pizza at the first stall where she decides to make a purchase, she buys and eats exactly one pizza. At the second one, she buys and eats half a pizza, and at the third she eats one quarter of a pizza, etc. Therefore, at the $k^\textrm {th}$ stall where she decides to buy some pizza, she eats $\frac1{2^{k-1}}^\textrm {th}$ part of a pizza. This way she makes sure that she never gets full! 
-----Input-----  - The first line has two integers, $1\leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$ and $0\leq m \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$, the number of pizza stalls and the number of one way connections.  - The second line has $n$ integers $c_0, \dots , c_{n-1}$, where each $0\leq c_ i \leq 10^9$, the amount of satisfaction Margriet gets from eating one pizza at stall $i$.  - The next $m$ lines each contain $2$ integers, $0\leq s<n$ and $0\leq t<n$, indicating a one way path from stall $s$ to stall $t$. No connection appears twice in the input. -----Output-----  - Print the maximal amount of satisfaction Margriet can reach at the pizza festival. Your answer is considered correct if it has absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 5 1 4 6 2 100 0 1 1 2 0 3 2 4 3 4 Sample Output 1: 100 Sample Input 2: 3 2 1 0 1 0 1 1 2 Sample Output 2: 1.5
