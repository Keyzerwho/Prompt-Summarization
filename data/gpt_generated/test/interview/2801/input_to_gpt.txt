You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

Sasha is taking part in a programming competition. In one of the problems she should check if some rooted trees are isomorphic or not. She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{h}, where h is the height of the tree, and a_{i} equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of i edges from root.  Unfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence a_{i}, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree. Two rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal. The height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex. 
tl;dr: You need to write a program that, given the sequence a_{i}, build two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree. 

Margriet A. is in pizza heaven! She has bought a one-day access pass to Pizza World. Pizza World is a food festival, where all stands have their own special type of pizza. Margriet would really like to try many different types of pizza, but she thinks that she can only eat two pizzas in total. Therefore, she has come up with a cunning plan: at each stall she visits she decides whether she wants to buy this pizza or not. At the first stall where she decides to make a purchase, she buys and eats exactly one pizza. At the second one, she buys and eats half a pizza, and at the third she eats one quarter of a pizza, etc.  Therefore, at the $k^\textrm {th}$ stall where she decides to buy some pizza, she eats $\frac1{2^{k-1}}^\textrm {th}$ part of a pizza. This way she makes sure that she never gets full! In order to ensure that the flow of people in the park is adequate, the pizza stalls are connected by one-way paths, and to make sure that everyone eventually leaves the festival, it is impossible to visit a pizza stall more than once. However, every stall is reachable from the stall at the entrance, which is the stall with number $0$. Of course, Margriet has her own taste: she likes some pizzas more than others. Eating pizza from a stall gives her a certain amount of satisfaction which is equal to Margriet s personal stall satisfaction number multiplied by the fraction of a whole pizza she eats there. Her total satisfaction is the sum of satisfactions of every stall she visits. Can you help Margriet plot a route between the pizza stalls that satisfies her the most
