Margriet wants to visit all the stalls, but she can only eat two pizzas in total. Therefore, she decides to eat pizza at the first stall where she decides to make a purchase, she buys and eats exactly one pizza. At the second one, she buys and eats half a pizza, and at the third she eats one quarter of a pizza, etc. Therefore, at the $k^\\textrm {th}$ stall where she decides to buy some pizza, she eats $\\frac1{2^{k-1}}^\\textrm {th}$ part of a pizza. This way she makes sure that she never gets full! ",
