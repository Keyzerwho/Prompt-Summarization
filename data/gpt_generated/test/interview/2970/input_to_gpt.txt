The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, $n$ is always even, and in C2, $n$ is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with $2 \cdot n$ vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length $1$. Let's name it as $2n$-gon. Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed $2n$-gon in the square. Embedding $2n$-gon in the square means that you need to place $2n$-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of $2n$-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can rotate $2n$-gon and/or the square.

There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem: There are two arrays of integers $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. It turned out that array $a$ contains only elements from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:  Choose any pair of indexes $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$. It is possible to choose the same pair $(i, j)$ more than once.   Add $a_i$ to $a_j$. In other words, $j$-th element of the array becomes equal to $a_i + a_j$.  For example, if you are given array $[1, -1, 0]$, you can transform it only to $[1, -1, -1]$, $[1, 0, 0]$ and $[1, -1, 1]$ by one operation. Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $a$ so that it becomes equal to array $b$. Can you help him

A new student dorm has been opened! It consists of $M$ buildings, labeled with integers from $1$ to $M$. The dorm is initially empty, but soon $N$ students will be moving in at a rate of exactly one student per day. Each time a new student moves in a building, a big party is being held inside that building. The noise of the party is equal to the number of students located inside the building. The dorm management is not particularly fond of noise, so they will occasionally empty a certain building to keep the parties at a reasonable noise level. They do this by moving all its residents to a completely different student dorm. The management can decide to do this after any day, but they realized that it doesn t pay off to do it more than $K$ times. Help the management! Knowing which buildings are being moved in by students, determine the minimal possible total noise level (the sum of noise levels of all $N$ parties) that can be achieved with emptying some of the buildings at most $K$ times.
