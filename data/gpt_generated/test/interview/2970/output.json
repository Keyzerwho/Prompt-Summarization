The dorm is initially empty, but soon $N$ students will be moving in at a rate of exactly one student per day. Each time a new student moves in a building, a big party is being held inside that building. The noise of the party is equal to the number of students located inside the building. The dorm management is not particularly fond of noise, so they will occasionally empty a certain building to keep the parties at a reasonable noise level. They do this by moving all its residents to a completely different student dorm. The management can decide to do this after any day, but they realized that it doesn t pay off to do it more than $K$ times. Help the management! Knowing which buildings are being moved in by students, determine the minimal possible total noise level (the sum of noise levels of all $N$ parties) that can be achieved with emptying some of the buildings at most $K$ times.
