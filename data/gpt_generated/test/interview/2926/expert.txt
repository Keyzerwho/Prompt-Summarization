 You are given a set of words. Each word is associated with a category. If a word appears in a statement, the statement is classified into the category associated with the word. 

-----Input----- The first line of input contains the number of categories $1 \le N \le 10$. The next $N$ lines each contain a description of a category. The description starts with the name of the category – a single word. Then, an integer $1 \le W \le 10$ follows – the number of words associated with this category. This is followed by those $W$ words, separated by spaces. No two words within a category are the same, and no two categories have the same name. This is followed by a number of lines describing the statement of the problem. Each line contains a list of space-separated words. Every word in the input will consist solely of at most $30$ lower-case letters a-z. The statement consists of between $1$ and $10000$ words. -----Output----- For each suggested category, output the name of the category on a single line, in lexicographical order. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 datastructure 3 query range sum geometry 3 euclid range vertex graph 3 query vertex hamiltonian math 3 hamiltonian sum euclid consider the hamiltonian graph where each vertex corresponds to an linear equation we can solve these using the euclid algorithm now you will receive a query corresponding to a range of vertices your task is to compute the sum of the minimum solution of those vertices Sample Output: datastructure geometry graph math
