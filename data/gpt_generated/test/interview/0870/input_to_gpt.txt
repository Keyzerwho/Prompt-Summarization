Sumit and Dhiraj are roommates in a hostel of NIT Jamshedpur,One day after completing there boring assignments of Artificial Intelligence, they decided to play a game as it was dhiraj,s idea to play a game so he started explaining the rules of the game to sumit. So the game was as follows-They randomly took a number N after that they find all its divisors.Suppose first sumit took a divisor then dhiraj and so on.The player who will be having the last divisor with him will win the game.Rohit their mutual friend,was observing them play. Can you help Rohit predict the outcome of game  If Sumit wins print "YES" without quotes and "NO" without quotes, if Dhiraj wins the game. 
tl;dr: Given a number N, return YES if it has an even number of positive divisors, NO otherwise. 

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships. 
tl;dr: Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 

Luke Skywalker got locked up in a rubbish shredder between two presses. R2D2 is already working on his rescue, but Luke needs to stay alive as long as possible. For simplicity we will assume that everything happens on a straight line, the presses are initially at coordinates 0 and L, and they move towards each other with speed v_1 and v_2, respectively. Luke has width d and is able to choose any position between the presses. Luke dies as soon as the distance between the presses is less than his width. Your task is to determine for how long Luke can stay alive.
