            "text": " Ms. Thomas is managing her class of $n$ students. She placed all her students in a line, and gave the $i$-th student from the left a card with the letter $a_ i$ written on it. She would now like to rearrange the students so that the $i$-th student from the left has a card with the letter $b_ i$ written on it. To do this, she will choose some consecutive group of students, and reverse their order. Students will hold on to their original cards during this process. She s now wondering, what is the number of valid ways to do this (It may be impossible, in which case, the answer is zero). With sequences $abba$ and $aabb$, Ms. Thomas can choose the group $a(bba)$. With sequences $caxcab$ and $cacxab$, Ms. Thomas can choose $ca(xc)ab$ or $c(axca)b$. With sequences $a$ and $z$, there are clearly no solutions. ",
