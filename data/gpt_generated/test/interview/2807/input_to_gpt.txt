You are given a sequence D_1, D_2, ..., D_N of length N. The values of D_i are all distinct. Does a tree with N vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., N.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., N-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - For each vertex i, the sum of the distances from i to the other vertices is D_i, assuming that the length of each edge is 1. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 100000  - 1 \leq D_i \leq 10^{12}  - D_i are all distinct.

----- ARRAY AND DISTINCT ELEMENTS ----- Chef is multitalented but he mistakenly took part in 2 contest which will take place at the same time. So while chef is busy at one cooking contest, he wants you to take part in coding contest. Chef wants u to solve this program for him. 	 You have been given an array of size n. You have to calculate a subarray of size k with maximum sum having distinct elements same as original array.

Ms. Thomas is managing her class of $n$ students. She placed all her students in a line, and gave the $i$-th student from the left a card with the letter $a_ i$ written on it. She would now like to rearrange the students so that the $i$-th student from the left has a card with the letter $b_ i$ written on it. To do this, she will choose some consecutive group of students, and reverse their order. Students will hold on to their original cards during this process. She s now wondering, what is the number of valid ways to do this  (It may be impossible, in which case, the answer is zero). With sequences $abba$ and $aabb$, Ms. Thomas can choose the group $a(bba)$. With sequences $caxcab$ and $cacxab$, Ms. Thomas can choose $ca(xc)ab$ or $c(axca)b$. With sequences $a$ and $z$, there are clearly no solutions.
