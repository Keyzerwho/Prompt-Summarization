There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

You've got array A, consisting of n integers and a positive integer k. Array A is indexed by integers from 1 to n. You need to permute the array elements so that value $\sum_{i = 1}^{n - k}|A [ i ] - A [ i + k ]|$ became minimal possible. In particular, it is allowed not to change order of elements at all.

At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

Ms. Thomas is managing her class of $n$ students. She placed all her students in a line, and gave the $i$-th student from the left a card with the letter $a_ i$ written on it. She would now like to rearrange the students so that the $i$-th student from the left has a card with the letter $b_ i$ written on it. To do this, she will choose some consecutive group of students, and reverse their order. Students will hold on to their original cards during this process. She s now wondering, what is the number of valid ways to do this  (It may be impossible, in which case, the answer is zero). With sequences $abba$ and $aabb$, Ms. Thomas can choose the group $a(bba)$. With sequences $caxcab$ and $cacxab$, Ms. Thomas can choose $ca(xc)ab$ or $c(axca)b$. With sequences $a$ and $z$, there are clearly no solutions.
