 You are given a sequence of letters. You need to find the number of valid ways to rearrange the letters so that the first letter becomes the last one. 
-----Input----- The input is two lines of lowercase letters, $A$ and $B$. The $i$-th character of $A$ and $B$ represent $a_ i$ and $b_ i$ respectively. It is guaranteed that $A$ and $B$ have the same positive length, and $A$ and $B$ are not identical. The common length is allowed to be as large as $100000$. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways Ms. Thomas can reverse some consecutive group of $A$ to form the line specified by string $B$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: abba aabb Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: caxcab cacxab Sample Output 2: 2
