Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order. For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5] Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6
tl;dr: You are given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string. 

An array of integers $p_{1},p_{2}, \ldots,p_{n}$ is called a permutation if it contains each number from $1$ to $n$ exactly once. For example, the following arrays are permutations: $[3,1,2], [1], [1,2,3,4,5]$ and $[4,3,1,2]$. The following arrays are not permutations: $[2], [1,1], [2,3,4]$. There is a hidden permutation of length $n$. For each index $i$, you are given $s_{i}$, which equals to the sum of all $p_{j}$ such that $j < i$ and $p_{j} < p_{i}$. In other words, $s_i$ is the sum of elements before the $i$-th element that are smaller than the $i$-th element. Your task is to restore the permutation.

Alice and Bob are playing a game on a simple connected graph with $N$ nodes and $M$ edges. Alice colors each edge in the graph red or blue. A path is a sequence of edges where each pair of consecutive edges have a node in common. If the first edge in the pair is of a different color than the second edge, then that is a  color change.  After Alice colors the graph, Bob chooses a path that begins at node $1$ and ends at node $N$. He can choose any path on the graph, but he wants to minimize the number of color changes in the path. Alice wants to choose an edge coloring to maximize the number of color changes Bob must make. What is the maximum number of color changes she can force Bob to make, regardless of which path he chooses
