A tree is a graph with n vertices and exactly n - 1 edges; this graph should meet the following condition: there exists exactly one shortest (by number of edges) path between any pair of its vertices. A subtree of a tree T is a tree with both vertices and edges as subsets of vertices and edges of T. You're given a tree with n vertices. Consider its vertices numbered with integers from 1 to n. Additionally an integer is written on every vertex of this tree. Initially the integer written on the i-th vertex is equal to v_{i}. In one move you can apply the following operation:  Select the subtree of the given tree that includes the vertex with number 1.  Increase (or decrease) by one all the integers which are written on the vertices of that subtree.  Calculate the minimum number of moves that is required to make all the integers written on the vertices of the given tree equal to zero.

In number world, two different numbers are friends if they have a lot in common, but also each one has unique perks. More precisely, two different numbers $a$ and $b$ are friends if $gcd(a,b)$, $\frac{a}{gcd(a,b)}$, $\frac{b}{gcd(a,b)}$ can form sides of a triangle. Three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can form sides of a triangle if $a + b > c$, $b + c > a$ and $c + a > b$. In a group of numbers, a number is lonely if it doesn't have any friends in that group. Given a group of numbers containing all numbers from $1, 2, 3, ..., n$, how many numbers in that group are lonely

There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

Alice and Bob are playing a game on a simple connected graph with $N$ nodes and $M$ edges. Alice colors each edge in the graph red or blue. A path is a sequence of edges where each pair of consecutive edges have a node in common. If the first edge in the pair is of a different color than the second edge, then that is a  color change.  After Alice colors the graph, Bob chooses a path that begins at node $1$ and ends at node $N$. He can choose any path on the graph, but he wants to minimize the number of color changes in the path. Alice wants to choose an edge coloring to maximize the number of color changes Bob must make. What is the maximum number of color changes she can force Bob to make, regardless of which path he chooses
