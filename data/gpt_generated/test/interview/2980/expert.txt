 Write a program that determines if a position of $S$-Nim is a losing or a winning position. A position is a winning position if there is at least one move to a losing position. A position is a losing position if there are no moves to a losing position. This means, as expected, that a position with no legal moves is a losing position.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a number $k$ ($1 \le k \le 100$) describing the size of $S$, followed by $k$ numbers $s_ i$ ($1 \le s_ i \le 10000$) describing $S$. The second line contains a number $m$ ($1 \le m \le 100$) describing the number of positions to evaluate. The next $m$ lines each contain a number $l$ ($1 \le l \le 100$) describing the number of heaps and $l$ numbers $h_ i$ ($0 \le h_ i \le 10000$) describing the number of beads in the heaps. -----Output----- For each position:  - If the described position is a winning position print a ‘W’.  - If the described position is a losing position print an ‘L’. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 2 5 3 2 5 12 3 2 4 7 4 2 3 7 12 Sample Output: LWW
