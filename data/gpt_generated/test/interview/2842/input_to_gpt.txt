You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening  Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages. These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before: * hello - english * ciao - italian * salut - french * hallo - german * hola - spanish * ahoj - czech republic * czesc - polish By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!! PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test) PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the test
tl;dr: Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hello in different languages. Regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests

Complete the function that takes an array of words. You must concatenate the `n`th letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where `n` is the position of the word in the list. For example: ``` ["yoda", "best", "has"]  -->  "yes"   ^        ^        ^   n=0     n=1     n=2 ``` **
tl;dr: Given an array of words, you must concatenate the nth letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where n is the position of the word in the list. 

Battleship is a game played by two players. Each player has their own grid, which is hidden from their opponent. Each player secretly places some ships on their grid. Each ship covers a horizontal or vertical straight line of one or more contiguous squares. Ships cannot overlap. All ships are considered distinct, even if they have the same size. The orientation of each ship is not important to the game, only the squares they occupy. After placing their ships, the players then take turns taking shots at their opponent s ships by calling out a coordinate of their opponent s grid. The opponent must honestly say whether the shot was a hit or a miss. When all of a ship s squares are hit, that ship sinks ( You sunk my battleship!! ). A player loses when all of their ships are sunk. Bob is playing a game of Mini Battleship against Alice. Regular Battleship is played on a $10 \! \times \! 10$ grid with $5$ ships. Mini Battleship is much smaller, with a grid no larger than $5 \! \times \! 5$ and possibly fewer than $5$ ships. Bob wonders how many ship placements are possible on Alice s board given what he knows so far. The answer will be $0$ if Alice is cheating! (Or, if the game setup isn t possible.) 
tl;dr:
