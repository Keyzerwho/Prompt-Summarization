 Given a grid size and number of ships, how many ship placements are possible?
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5$) and $k$ ($1 \le k \le 5$), which represent a game of Mini Battleship played on an $n \! \times \! n$ grid with $k$ ships. Each of the next $n$ lines contains a string $s$ ($|s|=n$). This is what Bob sees of Alice’s grid so far.  - A character ‘X’ represents one of Bob’s shots that missed.  - A character ‘O’ (Letter O, not zero) represents one of Bob’s shots that hit.  - A dot (‘.’) represents a square where Bob has not yet taken a shot. Each of the next $k$ lines contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le n$). These are the sizes of the ships. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the number of ways the $k$ distinct ships could be placed on Alice’s grid and be consistent with what Bob sees. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 3 .... .OX. .... O..X 3 2 1 Sample Output 1: 132 Sample Input 2: 4 4 .X.X .XX. ...X .... 1 2 3 4 Sample Output 2: 6
