# Definition **_Strong number_** is the number that *the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself*. ## **_For example_**:  **_145_**, since  ``` 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 ``` So, **_145_** is a **_Strong number_**.  ____ # Task **_Given_** a number, **_Find if it is Strong or not_**. ____ # Warm-up (Highly recommended) # [Playing With Numbers Series](https://www.codewars.com/collections/playing-with-numbers) ___ 
tl;dr: You are given a positive number, find if it is strong or not. 

Genos recently installed the game Zuma on his phone. In Zuma there exists a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal of the game is to destroy all the gemstones in the line as quickly as possible. In one second, Genos is able to choose exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  Let us remind, that the string (or substring) is called palindrome, if it reads same backwards or forward. In our case this means the color of the first gemstone is equal to the color of the last one, the color of the second gemstone is equal to the color of the next to last and so on.

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is `to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others`. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in **evenness**. Help Bob   to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number. `!` Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a `real IQ test`, which means indexes of the elements start from `1 (not 0)` ##
tl;dr: Write a function that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number. 

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
