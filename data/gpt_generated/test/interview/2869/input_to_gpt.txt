You are given a string $s$ of even length $n$. String $s$ is binary, in other words, consists only of 0's and 1's. String $s$ has exactly $\frac{n}{2}$ zeroes and $\frac{n}{2}$ ones ($n$ is even). In one operation you can reverse any substring of $s$. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. What is the minimum number of operations you need to make string $s$ alternating  A string is alternating if $s_i \neq s_{i + 1}$ for all $i$. There are two types of alternating strings in general: 01010101... or 10101010...

$Harshad$ $Mehta$ is planning  a new scam with the stocks he is given a stock of  integer price S and a number K . $harshad$ has got the power to change the number $S$ at most $K$ times In order to raise the price of stock and now cash it for his benefits Find the largest price at which $harshad$ can sell the stock in order to maximize his profit

Using roman numerals the numbers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9$ are written as  I ,  II ,  III ,  IV ,  V ,  VI ,  VII ,  VIII ,  IX . The numbers $10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90$ are written as  X ,  XX ,  XXX ,  XL ,  L ,  LX ,  LXX ,  LXXX ,  XC . Any number smaller than $100$ can be written by converting tens and ones separately and concatenating the results. So, for example, the number $48$ would be written as XLVIII, XL for $40$ and VIII for $8$. Given a number written in roman numerals, rearrange its characters so that you create the smallest possible number, written in roman numerals.
