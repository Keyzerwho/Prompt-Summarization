 Given a list of coins, find the smallest slot size that can hold all of them. 
-----Input----- Input begins with a line containing $N$, the number of sides to the polygonal coin, where $3 \leq N \leq 20$. This is followed by $N$ lines, each containing two real numbers $x$ and $y$, the coordinates of a vertex of the polygon, where $0 \leq x, y \leq 100$. All real numbers have at most $2$ digits after the decimal point. All $N$ vertices will be distinct, and the vertices will be presented in an order proceeding clockwise around the perimeter of the coin. -----Output----- Print a single line with a real number denoting the minimum slot size allowing the coin to pass through. Outputs will be accepted that are within $\pm 0.01$ of the judgesâ€™ answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 0 0 0.71 3.54 4.21 4.21 Sample Output: 2.00111219
