Master Oogway has forseen that a panda named Po will be the dragon warrior, and the master of Chi. But he did not tell anyone about the spell that would make him the master of Chi, and has left Po confused. Now Po has to defeat Kai, who is the super villian, the strongest of them all. Po needs to master Chi, and he finds a spell which unlocks his powerful Chi. But the spell is rather strange. It asks Po to calculate the factorial of a number! Po is very good at mathematics, and thinks that this is very easy. So he leaves the spell, thinking it's a hoax. But little does he know that this can give him the ultimate power of Chi. Help Po by solving the spell and proving that it's not a hoax. 
tl;dr: Find the factorial of each number from 1 to given positive integer n.

Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

The small nation of Erratica prides itself on defying conventions established by the more  boring  countries around the world. One of their more obvious distinctions lies in the design of their coinage. Believing that a person should be easily able to identify the value a coin in a pocket or change purse by touch alone, Erratica designs its coins as polygons. For stability, the coins are convex   there are no notches cut into the coins. But the overall shapes themselves can be quite irregular. Erratica Vending, the only manufacturer of vending machines in the nation, has been sent the design for a new coin to be issued. Their machines are designed so that coins enter through a slot into channel shaped as a rectangular prism with the slot being an open face of the prism. The channel is narrow because the coins are thin, but long enough to contain the entire coin. From the outside of the machine, the slot appears as a rectangular hole. The company wants to know what would be the smallest slot size they will need so that the new coin can be slipped, after some rotation, into the slot.
