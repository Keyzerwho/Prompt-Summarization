The small nation of Erratica prides itself on defying conventions established by the more  boring  countries around the world. One of their more obvious distinctions lies in the design of their coinage. Believing that a person should be easily able to identify the value a coin in a pocket or change purse by touch alone, Erratica designs its coins as polygons. For stability, the coins are convex   there are no notches cut into the coins. But the overall shapes themselves can be quite irregular. Erratica Vending, the only manufacturer of vending machines in the nation, has been sent the design for a new coin to be issued. Their machines are designed so that coins enter through a slot into channel shaped as a rectangular prism with the slot being an open face of the prism. The channel is narrow because the coins are thin, but long enough to contain the entire coin. From the outside of the machine, the slot appears as a rectangular hole. The company wants to know what would be the smallest slot size they will need so that the new coin can be slipped, after some rotation, into the slot.
