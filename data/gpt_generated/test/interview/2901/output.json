A team is a perfect team if and only if every player is placed on a node with a synergy score that is greater or equal to the node s degree. A node s degree is the number of links to which it is linked in the formation. A player placed on a node in the formation derives synergy from all players placed on nodes to which the player is linked in the formation. Thus, a node s synergy score is the sum of the synergy scores of all links to which the node is connected.",
