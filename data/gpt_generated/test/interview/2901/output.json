He also knows what country they re from, what league they play in, and what team they play for. He doesn t know much about soccer, but he does know these things:  - If two players are from the same country, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $1$.  - If two players are in the same league, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $1$.  - If two players are on the same team, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $2$.  - If two players are from the same country and in the same league, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $2$.  - If two players are from the same country and on the same team, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $3$. A team can only be in one league and no two teams will have the same name unless they are the same team. He has to place the players on his team into a formation of $10$ nodes which can be represented as an undirected graph. The illustration shows the first sample. Therefore, Johnny has to place a player in each node of the graph. Given a particular formation and the members of Johnny s team, output whether it is possible for Johnny to organize his team to get a perfect team. A team is a perfect team if and only if every player is placed on a node with a synergy score that is greater or equal to the node s degree. A node s degree is the number of links to which it is",
