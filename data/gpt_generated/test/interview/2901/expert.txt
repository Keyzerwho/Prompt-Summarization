 Given a formation and the members of Johnny s team, output whether it is possible for Johnny to organize his team to get a perfect team. A team is a perfect team if and only if every player is placed on a node with a synergy score that is greater or equal to the node s degree. A node s degree is the number of links to which it is linked in the formation. A player placed on a node in the formation derives synergy from all players placed on nodes to which the player is linked in the formation. Thus, a node s synergy score is the sum of the synergy scores of all links to which the node is connected.
-----Input----- The input will contain a single test case. The first line of the input will have one integer $c$ ($0 \leq c \leq 45$). $c$ represents the number of edges in the formation. The next $c$ lines represent the connections between nodes represented as two integers $a$ ($0 \leq a < 10$) and $b$ ($0 \leq b < 10$), where $a$ is not equal to $b$. Then, the next $10$ lines will be the players on Johnnyâ€™s team. Each line will contain four strings in the following order: player name, nation, league, team, which are delimited by a single space. These strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and consist of up to $15$ alphanumeric characters, which includes lower- and uppercase English letters, digits, and hyphens. -----Output----- If a perfect team can be organized by Johnny, print yes. Otherwise, print no. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 15 0 1 1 2 2 3 0 4 1 5 2 6 3 7 4 5 5 6 6 7 4 8 5 8 6 9 7 9 8 9 Griezmann France LaLiga AtleticoMadrid Benzema France LaLiga RealMadrid Ntep France Ligue1 StadeRennais Sissoko France PremierLeague Spurs Tolisso France Ligue1 Lyon Diarra France Ligue1 OM Evra France CalcioA Juventus Koscielny France PremierLeague Arsenal Varane France LaLiga RealMadrid Sagna France PremierLeague ManCity Sample Output: yes
