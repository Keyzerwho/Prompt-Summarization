Pikachu had an array with him. He wrote down all the non-empty subsequences of the array on paper. Note that an array of size n has 2^{n} - 1 non-empty subsequences in it.  Pikachu being mischievous as he always is, removed all the subsequences in which Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -  Minimum_element_of_subsequence    d Pikachu was finally left with X subsequences.  However, he lost the initial array he had, and now is in serious trouble. He still remembers the numbers X and d. He now wants you to construct any such array which will satisfy the above conditions. All the numbers in the final array should be positive integers less than 10^18.  Note the number of elements in the output array should not be more than 10^4. If no answer is possible, print  - 1. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers X and d. You should construct an array such that, removing all non-empty subsequences in which Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -  Minimum_element_of_subsequence    d from the set of all subsequences will give you X subsequences. 

Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order. Iroha is looking for X,Y,Z-Haiku (defined below) in integer sequences. Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku  Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0   x < y < z < w   N) such that all of the following are satisfied:  - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X  - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y  - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Since the answer can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 3   N   40  - 1   X   5  - 1   Y   7  - 1   Z   5

Johnny has been roped into a fantasy soccer league and needs your help to set up the best team.  He has a list of $10$ players that are on his fantasy team (no goalkeepers in this league). He also knows what country they re from, what league they play in, and what team they play for. He doesn t know much about soccer, but he does know these things:  - If two players are from the same country, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $1$.  - If two players are in the same league, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $1$.  - If two players are on the same team, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $2$.  - If two players are from the same country and in the same league, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $2$.  - If two players are from the same country and on the same team, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $3$. A team can only be in one league and no two teams will have the same name unless they are the same team. He has to place the players on his team into a formation of $10$ nodes which can be represented as an undirected graph. The illustration shows the first sample. Therefore, Johnny has to place a player in each node of the graph. Given a particular formation and the members of Johnny s team, output whether it is possible for Johnny to organize his team to get a perfect team. A team is a perfect team if and only if every player is placed on a node with a synergy score that is greater or equal to the node s degree. A node s degree is the number of links to which it is linked in the formation. A player placed on a node in the formation derives synergy from all players placed on nodes to which the player is linked in the formation. Thus, a node s synergy score is the sum of the synergy scores of all links to which the node is connected.
