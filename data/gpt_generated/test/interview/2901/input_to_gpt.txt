The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other. Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both  Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others        Explanation Self-Explanator
tl;dr: You are given a string, if it contains the word berhampore , print GCETTB or if it contains serampore print GCETTS. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both, otherwise print others.Ignore the case.   Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others      

# A History Lesson Soundex is an interesting phonetic algorithm developed nearly 100 years ago for indexing names as they are pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex # Preface I first read about Soundex over 30 years ago. At the time it seemed to me almost  like  A.I. that you could just type in somebody's name the way it sounded and there was still a pretty good chance it could match the correct person record. That was about the same year as the first "Terminator" movie so it was easy for me to put 2 and 2 together and conclude that Arnie must have had some kind of futuristic Soundex chip in his titanium skull helping him to locate ```Serah Coner```... or was it ```Sarh Connor```... or maybe ```Sayra Cunnarr```... :-) # Task In this Kata you will encode strings using a Soundex variation called "American Soundex" using the following (case insensitive) steps: * Save the first letter. Remove all occurrences of ```h``` and ```w``` except first letter. * Replace all consonants (include the first letter) with digits as follows:  * ```b```, ```f```, ```p```, ```v``` = 1  * ```c```, ```g```, ```j```, ```k```, ```q```, ```s```, ```x```, ```z``` = 2  * ```d```, ```t``` = 3  * ```l``` = 4  * ```m```, ```n``` = 5  * ```r``` = 6 * Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit. * Remove all occurrences of ```a```, ```e```, ```i```, ```o```, ```u```, ```y``` except first letter. * If first symbol is a digit replace it with letter saved on step 1. * Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except first letter and 3 digits after it ## Input A space separated string of one or more names. E.g. ```Sarah Connor``` ## Output Space separated string of equivalent Soundex codes (the first character of each code must be uppercase). E.g. ```S600 C560``

Johnny has been roped into a fantasy soccer league and needs your help to set up the best team.  He has a list of $10$ players that are on his fantasy team (no goalkeepers in this league). He also knows what country they re from, what league they play in, and what team they play for. He doesn t know much about soccer, but he does know these things:  - If two players are from the same country, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $1$.  - If two players are in the same league, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $1$.  - If two players are on the same team, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $2$.  - If two players are from the same country and in the same league, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $2$.  - If two players are from the same country and on the same team, a link between the two players will have a synergy score of $3$. A team can only be in one league and no two teams will have the same name unless they are the same team. He has to place the players on his team into a formation of $10$ nodes which can be represented as an undirected graph. The illustration shows the first sample. Therefore, Johnny has to place a player in each node of the graph. Given a particular formation and the members of Johnny s team, output whether it is possible for Johnny to organize his team to get a perfect team. A team is a perfect team if and only if every player is placed on a node with a synergy score that is greater or equal to the node s degree. A node s degree is the number of links to which it is linked in the formation. A player placed on a node in the formation derives synergy from all players placed on nodes to which the player is linked in the formation. Thus, a node s synergy score is the sum of the synergy scores of all links to which the node is connected.
