Snuke is playing a puzzle game. In this game, you are given a rectangular board of dimensions R   C, filled with numbers. Each integer i from 1 through N is written twice, at the coordinates (x_{i,1},y_{i,1}) and (x_{i,2},y_{i,2}). The objective is to draw a curve connecting the pair of points where the same integer is written, for every integer from 1 through N. Here, the curves may not go outside the board or cross each other. Determine whether this is possible. -----Constraints-----  - 1   R,C   10^8  - 1   N   10^5  - 0   x_{i,1},x_{i,2}   R(1   i   N)  - 0   y_{i,1},y_{i,2}   C(1   i   N)  - All given points are distinct.  - All input values are integers.

Mirko has been a very good boy, so he got exactly what he wanted for his birthday, a  Young physicist  kit! In the kit, there are $N$ types of resistors, connecting wires and an ohmmeter. If a resistor is of type $i$, it provides a resistance of precisely $R_ i$ ohms. As we all know, resistors can be connected in two different ways, in series and parallel. Also, we know that the complete circuit of resistors can be replaced with one resistor of the resistance equal to the equivalent resistance of the circuit. When the circuit is series, it is written as (R1-R2-R3- -RK) and the following formula holds:\begin{equation*} R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \cdots + R_ K \quad . \end{equation*} When the circuit is parallel, it is written as (R1|R2|R3| |RK) and the following formula holds:\begin{equation*} R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + \cdots + 1/R_ K} \quad . \end{equation*} Mirko was excited to bring his new toy to school, where he showed it to all his friends. Unfortunately for him, the teacher also noticed the toy. She quickly connected a circuit and is now asking Mirko to tell her the equivalent resistance of the circuit. Help Mirko and answer the teacher s question!
