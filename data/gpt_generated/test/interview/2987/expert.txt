 You are given the number of seats left on a flight as well as the number of weeks left before the flight. Your job is to set the ticket price for the current week, in order to maximize the total revenue obtained from ticket sales from the current week to the time of the flight. 
-----Input----- The input consists of one case. The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $W$, the number of seats left and the number of weeks left before the flight ($0 < N \leq 300$, $0 \leq W \leq 52$). The next $W+1$ lines give the estimates for $W$ weeks, $W-1$ weeks, â€¦, and down to $0$ weeks (i.e. last week) before the flight. Each of these lines starts with an integer $K$ ($0 < K \leq 100$), the number of different prices to consider that week. This is followed by $K$ integers $0 < p_1 < \cdots < p_ K < 1000$ giving the prices in dollars. Finally, this is followed by $K$ additional integers $s_1, \ldots , s_ K$ ($0 \leq s_ i \leq N$) indicating the number of tickets that will be sold for the corresponding prices. -----Output----- On the first line, print the maximum total revenue the airline can obtain from ticket sales from the current week to the time of the flight. On the second line, print the ticket price to set for the current week ($W$ weeks before the flight) to achieve this maximum. If there are multiple sets of ticket prices achieving this maximum, choose the smallest ticket price for week $W$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 50 2 1 437 47 3 357 803 830 13 45 46 1 611 14 Sample Output: 23029 437
