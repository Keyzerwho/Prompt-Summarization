            "text": " You have been hired by the International Contrived Pricing Corporation (ICPC) to set ticket prices each week for airlines. The airlines have collected and analyzed historical data, and have good estimates on the number of seats that will be sold at a particular ticket price with a particular number of weeks before the flight. Given the number of seats left on a flight as well as the number of weeks left before the flight, your job is to set the ticket price for the current week, in order to maximize the total revenue obtained from ticket sales from the current week to the time of the flight. You may assume that the number of tickets sold is exactly the same as the estimates, unless there are not enough remaining seats. In that case, all remaining seats will be sold. You may also assume that the optimal ticket prices will be chosen for the remaining weeks before the flight. Note that higher prices do not necessarily mean fewer tickets will be sold. In fact, higher prices can sometimes increase sales as travellers may be worried that the prices will rise even higher later.",
