Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party  Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter. 
tl;dr: Calculate the number of different collisions if a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls are given where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0 and collison occurs when two boys like the same girl.  

Master Oogway has forseen that a panda named Po will be the dragon warrior, and the master of Chi. But he did not tell anyone about the spell that would make him the master of Chi, and has left Po confused. Now Po has to defeat Kai, who is the super villian, the strongest of them all. Po needs to master Chi, and he finds a spell which unlocks his powerful Chi. But the spell is rather strange. It asks Po to calculate the factorial of a number! Po is very good at mathematics, and thinks that this is very easy. So he leaves the spell, thinking it's a hoax. But little does he know that this can give him the ultimate power of Chi. Help Po by solving the spell and proving that it's not a hoax. 
tl;dr: Find the factorial of each number from 1 to given positive integer n. 

You are given a prime number $p$, $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, and an integer $k$.  Find the number of pairs of indexes $(i, j)$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$) for which $(a_i + a_j)(a_i^2 + a_j^2) \equiv k \bmod p$.

Plane ticket prices fluctuate wildly from one week to the next, and their unpredictability is a major source of frustration for travellers. Some travellers regret buying tickets too early when the prices drop right after they purchase the tickets, and some travellers regret buying tickets too late when prices rise right before they are about to make the purchase. At the end, no one is happy, except the airlines, of course. Surely there is some reason to this madness. It turns out that airlines price their tickets dynamically, based on how many seats are still available and how close the flight is. For example, if there are very few seats left on a flight then the tickets may be expensive until the last few weeks before the flight, at which point the prices may decrease to fill the empty seats. Ultimately, the airlines wish to maximize revenue from each flight. You have been hired by the International Contrived Pricing Corporation (ICPC) to set ticket prices each week for airlines. The airlines have collected and analyzed historical data, and have good estimates on the number of seats that will be sold at a particular ticket price with a particular number of weeks before the flight. Given the number of seats left on a flight as well as the number of weeks left before the flight, your job is to set the ticket price for the current week, in order to maximize the total revenue obtained from ticket sales from the current week to the time of the flight. You may assume that the number of tickets sold is exactly the same as the estimates, unless there are not enough remaining seats. In that case, all remaining seats will be sold. You may also assume that the optimal ticket prices will be chosen for the remaining weeks before the flight. Note that higher prices do not necessarily mean fewer tickets will be sold. In fact, higher prices can sometimes increase sales as travellers may be worried that the prices will rise even higher later.
