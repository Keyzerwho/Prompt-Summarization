Give me Chocolate Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices. Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money. Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy   For example,  if prices =[1,2,3,4] and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend. The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= prices[i] <= 109 A chocolate can't be bought multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 4 Explanation she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most. These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10
tl;dr: You are given an array of size n and a limiting number k. Find the maximum count of numbers from array whose sum is not greater than k. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of elements in array and a limiting number. The next line contains n space-separated integers array[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= array[i] <= 109 A number can't be repeated multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum count of array numbers whose sum can't be greater than k. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv has an array A that consists of N positive integers. Let A[i] be the i-th number in this array (i = 1, 2, ..., N). Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A. More formally, this x should satisfy the following relations: A[1] mod x = 0, A[2] mod x = 0, ..., A[N] mod x = 0, where mod stands for the modulo operation. For example,  8 mod 3 = 2,  2 mod 2 = 0, 100 mod 5 = 0 and so on. If such number does not exist, output -1.

Toad Pimple has an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. We say that $y$ is reachable from $x$ if $x<y$ and there exists an integer array $p$ such that $x = p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_k=y$, and $a_{p_i}\, \&\, a_{p_{i+1}} > 0$ for all integers $i$ such that $1 \leq i < k$. Here $\&$ denotes the bitwise AND operation. You are given $q$ pairs of indices, check reachability for each of them.

$N$ points are placed in the coordinate plane. Write a program that calculates how many ways we can choose three points so that they form a right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes. A right triangle has one 90-degree internal angle. The legs of a right triangle are its two shorter sides.
