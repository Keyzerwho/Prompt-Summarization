Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values.  For example: `[23, 3, 19, 21, 16]` should return `20` (i.e., `23 - 3`). `[1, 434, 555, 34, 112]` should return `554` (i.e., `555 - 1`). The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv has an array A that consists of N positive integers. Let A[i] be the i-th number in this array (i = 1, 2, ..., N). Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A. More formally, this x should satisfy the following relations: A[1] mod x = 0, A[2] mod x = 0, ..., A[N] mod x = 0, where mod stands for the modulo operation. For example,  8 mod 3 = 2,  2 mod 2 = 0, 100 mod 5 = 0 and so on. If such number does not exist, output -1. 
tl;dr: You are given an array A that consists of N positive integers. Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A.  If such number does not exist, output -1. 

A new town is being built far out in the country, and currently there are $N$ houses. People have already started moving in. However, some of the houses aren t connected to the internet yet, and naturally residents are outraged. The houses are numbered $1$ to $N$. House number $1$ has already been connected to the internet via a long network cable to a neighboring town. The plan is to provide internet to other houses by connecting pairs of houses with separate network cables. A house is connected to the internet if it has a network cable to another house that s already connected to the internet. Given a list of which pairs of houses are already connected by a network cable, determine which houses are not yet connected to the internet.
