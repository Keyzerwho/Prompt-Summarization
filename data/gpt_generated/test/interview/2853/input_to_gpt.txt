The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other. Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both  Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others        Explanation Self-Explanator
tl;dr: You are given a string, if it contains the word berhampore , print GCETTB or if it contains serampore print GCETTS. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both, otherwise print others.Ignore the case.   Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others      

You are given $n$ arrays that can have different sizes. You also have a table with $w$ columns and $n$ rows. The $i$-th array is placed horizontally in the $i$-th row. You can slide each array within its row as long as it occupies several consecutive cells and lies completely inside the table. You need to find the maximum sum of the integers in the $j$-th column for each $j$ from $1$ to $w$ independently.  [Image] Optimal placements for columns $1$, $2$ and $3$ are shown on the pictures from left to right.  Note that you can exclude any array out of a column provided it remains in the window. In this case its value is considered to be zero.

Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input.

A new town is being built far out in the country, and currently there are $N$ houses. People have already started moving in. However, some of the houses aren t connected to the internet yet, and naturally residents are outraged. The houses are numbered $1$ to $N$. House number $1$ has already been connected to the internet via a long network cable to a neighboring town. The plan is to provide internet to other houses by connecting pairs of houses with separate network cables. A house is connected to the internet if it has a network cable to another house that s already connected to the internet. Given a list of which pairs of houses are already connected by a network cable, determine which houses are not yet connected to the internet.
