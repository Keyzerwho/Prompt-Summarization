Masha and Grisha like studying sets of positive integers. One day Grisha has written a set A containing n different integers a_{i} on a blackboard. Now he asks Masha to create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different. Both Masha and Grisha don't like big numbers, so all numbers in A are from 1 to 10^6, and all numbers in B must also be in the same range. Help Masha to create the set B that satisfies Grisha's requirement. 
tl;dr: Set A containing n positive different integers a_{i} are given.  Create a set B containing n different integers b_{j} such that all n^2 integers that can be obtained by summing up a_{i} and b_{j} for all possible pairs of i and j are different.  All numbers in A and B are from 1 to 10^6. 

Given a name, turn that name into a perfect square matrix (nested array with the amount of arrays equivalent to the length of each array).  You will need to add periods (`.`) to the end of the name if necessary, to turn it into a matrix.  If the name has a length of 0, return `"name must be at least one letter"` ##

Codefortia is a small island country located somewhere in the West Pacific. It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads. Codefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:   it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible.  The king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned  
tl;dr: You are given a connected graph of $n$ nodes and $m$ bidirectional edges. For each node $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, you need to find a minimum spanning tree. Then output the minimum cost required to travel between node $1$ and node $p$. 

Emma and Marcos are two friends who love horror films. This year, and possibly the years hereafter, they want to watch as many films together as possible. Unfortunately, they do not exactly have the same taste in films. So, inevitably, every now and then either Emma or Marcos has to watch a film she or he dislikes. When neither of them likes a film, they will not watch it. To make things fair they thought of the following rule: They can not watch two films in a row which are disliked by the same person. In other words, if one of them does not like the current film, then they are reassured they will like the next one. They open the TV guide and mark their preferred films. They only receive one channel which shows one film per day. Luckily, the TV guide has already been determined for the next $1$ million days. Can you determine the maximal number of films they can watch in a fair way
