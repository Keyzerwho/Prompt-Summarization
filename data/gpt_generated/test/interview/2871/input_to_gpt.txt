Genos recently installed the game Zuma on his phone. In Zuma there exists a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal of the game is to destroy all the gemstones in the line as quickly as possible. In one second, Genos is able to choose exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  Let us remind, that the string (or substring) is called palindrome, if it reads same backwards or forward. In our case this means the color of the first gemstone is equal to the color of the last one, the color of the second gemstone is equal to the color of the next to last and so on. 
tl;dr: You are given a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal is to destroy all the gemstones in the line. In one second, exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones is chosen that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again.  What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  

How many days are we represented in a foreign country  My colleagues make business trips to a foreign country. We must find the number of days our company is represented in a country. Every day that one or more colleagues are present in the country is a day that the company is represented. A single day cannot count for more than one day. Write a function that recieves a list of pairs and returns the number of days that the company is represented in the foreign country. The first number of the pair is the number of the day of arrival and the second number of the pair is the day of departure of someone who travels, i.e. 1 january is number 1 and 31 of december is 365.

You are given several queries. Each query consists of three integers $p$, $q$ and $b$. You need to answer whether the result of $p/q$ in notation with base $b$ is a finite fraction. A fraction in notation with base $b$ is finite if it contains finite number of numerals after the decimal point. It is also possible that a fraction has zero numerals after the decimal point.

The annual student team competition in table tennis of students enrolled in University of Zagreb takes place next Saturday! Each team consists of $K$ students. The excited students, $N$ of them, are waiting in queue to register. Kre o works at the registration desk. He doesn t really feel like doing his job so he decided not to allow students to choose a team. He decided that the first team will consist of the first $K$ students standing in queue, the second team the following $K$ students, the third one the following $K$ students and so on ($N$ will be divisible by $K$ so nobody is left hanging.) Ante has estimated the skill of each player with an integer. He would like to have the $K$ strongest players in the first team, the following $K$ strongest in the second team and so on  Kre o has just taken a break and Ante decided to shift the students standing in queue so that he achieves his goal. The way he shifts them is that he tells a student to step out of the queue and go back in queue after another student or to go to the front of the queue. It takes him one minute to do this. It s possible that Kre o is going to return from his break any moment so Ante needs to achieve his goal as soon as possible. Help Ante determine the minimal number of minutes necessary for him to achieve his goal.
