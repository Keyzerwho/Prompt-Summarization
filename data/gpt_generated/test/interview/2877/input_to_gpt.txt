A simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1 
tl;dr: You have find out the frequency of letters in a given string and print it as the new string which comprises of the letter followed by its frequency.For example string is- abcdabf. Then the new string is- a2b2c1d1f1

Mario is making up silly games again instead of reading Dostoevsky for school. The rules of his newest game follow. First he chooses a random word from the book. Then he splits the word in two arbitrary places to get three separate words. After that he reverses the order of the letters in each of those three words (exchanges the first and last letters, the second and second last and so on). Finally, he puts the three words back together in the same order in which they were before splitting. The goal of the game is to obtain the lexicographically smallest word possible. In other words, of all words that can be obtained by the above procedure, find one which would be earliest in a dictionary. Write a program that plays Mario s game perfectly.
