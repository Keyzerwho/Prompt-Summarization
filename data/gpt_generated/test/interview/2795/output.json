            "text": " In a rainforest there are $n$ treehouses high in the forest canopy on different trees (numbered from $1$ to $n$). The $i$-th tree s location is at $(x_ i, y_ i)$. The first $e$ of them in the list are close enough to neighboring open land around the rainforest so that transportation between all of them is easy by foot. Some treehouses may already be connected by direct straight cables through the air that can allow transport between them. Residents want easy transportation between all the treehouses and the open land, by some combination of walking (between those near the open land), and using one or more cables between treehouses. This may require the addition of more cables. Since the cables are expensive, they would like to add the smallest possible length of cable. The height of a cable up two trees can be set so cables can criss-cross other cables, and not allow any snags or crashes. It is not safe to try to switch between two criss-crossed cables in mid-air!
