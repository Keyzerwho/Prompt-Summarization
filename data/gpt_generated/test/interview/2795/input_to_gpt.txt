You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. Find the maximum possible value of $a_{i} \operatorname{mod} a_{j}$ (integer remainder of a_{i} divided by a_{j}), where 1   i, j   n and a_{i}   a_{j}.

You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.

In a rainforest there are $n$ treehouses high in the forest canopy on different trees (numbered from $1$ to $n$). The $i$-th tree s location is at $(x_ i, y_ i)$. The first $e$ of them in the list are close enough to neighboring open land around the rainforest so that transportation between all of them is easy by foot. Some treehouses may already be connected by direct straight cables through the air that can allow transport between them. Residents want easy transportation between all the treehouses and the open land, by some combination of walking (between those near the open land), and using one or more cables between treehouses. This may require the addition of more cables. Since the cables are expensive, they would like to add the smallest possible length of cable. The height of a cable up two trees can be set so cables can criss-cross other cables, and not allow any snags or crashes. It is not safe to try to switch between two criss-crossed cables in mid-air!
