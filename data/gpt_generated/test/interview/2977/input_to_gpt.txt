Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion  Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. 
tl;dr: You have to shuffle digits of the given proportion(x : y :: z : w) in order to check that is it possible to make new proportion or not. 

You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.   Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   
tl;dr: You have to apply + and - symbol between the given list non-negative integers to achieve the target S. In how many ways are there to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.   

Given an array of integers. Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. If the input array is empty or null, return an empty array. #

In the intergalactic low budget streaming show  Flag quiz! , contestants need to answer questions along the lines of  What are the joint colors, symbols and shapes occurring on the flags of Empire $X$  . An empire in this context is simply some subset of entities on the same planet, or otherwise related, according to the fantasies of the Supreme Map Maker. For instance, according to the system set by the Supreme Map Maker,  Empire Earth Meridian 0  are all nations cut by the zeroth meridian on Earth. This is not necessarily the same system used locally on each planet, for instance the zeroth meridian goes through Stockholm in this system. Knowledge of geography, politics or culture can actually be an obstacle on your way to victory in this challenge!  However, sometimes (actually, most of the time) you can figure out the answer to a quiz question just by looking at the alternatives. Being a low budget show, the underpaid quiz question authors strive to minimize their effort in coming up with the alternatives for each question. They construct each alternative by making a small number of changes to the correct answer, where a change consists of replacing one part of the correct answer with something else. For example, transforming  green, blue, stripes  into  green, yellow, stripes  has one single change, while changing the same answer into  life, universe, stripes  has two changes. The question authors never permute the parts, so order matters. In other words, transforming  green, blue, stripes  into  stripes, blue, green  has two changes even though they are both technically the same answer. Note that the answers are case sensitive, so  green, blue, stripes  and  Green, Blue, Stripes  need 3 changes. Your task is to write a program that automatically finds the most likely answers to questions constructed in this way. Define the incongruousity of an alternative as the maximum number of changes needed to transform that alternative into any of the other alternatives. We then seek the alternative(s) with the smallest incongruousity. -----Task----- Given a question and a set of potential answers to it, find the answer that is easiest to change into any other answer.
