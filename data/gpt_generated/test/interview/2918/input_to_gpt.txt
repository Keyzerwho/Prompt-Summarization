You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1   i < j   N.

You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Task ======= Make a custom esolang interpreter for the language Tick. Tick is a descendant of [Ticker](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-ticker) but also very different data and command-wise. Syntax/Info ======== Commands are given in character format. Non-command characters should be ignored. Tick has an potentially infinite memory as opposed to Ticker(which you have a special command to add a new cell) and only has 4 commands(as opposed to 7). Read about this esolang [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Tick). Commands ======== `>`: Move data selector right `<`: Move data selector left(infinite in both directions) `+`: Increment memory cell by 1. 255+1=0 `*`: Add ascii value of memory cell to the output tape.

You are organising a king of the hill tournament, the Buenos Aires Paddleboarding Competition (BAPC), with $n$ participants. In a king of the hill tournament, one person starts as a  king  and is then challenged by another person, the winning person becomes the new king. This is repeated until all participants have challenged exactly once (except for the starting person). In a paddleboarding match, there are no draws. The person which ends up as king, wins the tournament. Since you are the organiser, you get to choose the starting person and the order in which they challenge the king. Someone is offering you a substantial amount of money in case one of the participants, Henk, ends up winning the tournament. You happen to know, for any two participants $x$ and $y$, which of the two would win if they were to match during the tournament. Consequently, you choose to do the unethical: you will try to rig the game. Can you find a schedule that makes Henk win the tournament
