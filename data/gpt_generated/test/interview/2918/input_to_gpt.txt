Give me Chocolate Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices. Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money. Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy   For example,  if prices =[1,2,3,4] and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend. The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= prices[i] <= 109 A chocolate can't be bought multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 4 Explanation she can buy only 4 chocolatess at most. These chocolates have the following prices: 1, 12, 5, 10
tl;dr: You are given an array of size n and a limiting number k. Find the maximum count of numbers from array whose sum is not greater than k. Input Format The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of elements in array and a limiting number. The next line contains n space-separated integers array[i] Constraints 1<= n <= 105 1<= k <= 109 1<= array[i] <= 109 A number can't be repeated multiple times. Output Format An integer that denotes the maximum count of array numbers whose sum can't be greater than k. Sample Input 7 50 1 12 5 111 200 1000 10 Sample Output 

You are given two positive integers N and K. How many multisets of rational numbers satisfy all of the following conditions   - The multiset has exactly N elements and the sum of them is equal to K.  - Each element of the multiset is one of 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots. In other words, each element can be represented as \frac{1}{2^i}\ (i = 0,1,\dots). The answer may be large, so print it modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 3000  - All values in input are integers.

You are organising a king of the hill tournament, the Buenos Aires Paddleboarding Competition (BAPC), with $n$ participants. In a king of the hill tournament, one person starts as a  king  and is then challenged by another person, the winning person becomes the new king. This is repeated until all participants have challenged exactly once (except for the starting person). In a paddleboarding match, there are no draws. The person which ends up as king, wins the tournament. Since you are the organiser, you get to choose the starting person and the order in which they challenge the king. Someone is offering you a substantial amount of money in case one of the participants, Henk, ends up winning the tournament. You happen to know, for any two participants $x$ and $y$, which of the two would win if they were to match during the tournament. Consequently, you choose to do the unethical: you will try to rig the game. Can you find a schedule that makes Henk win the tournament
