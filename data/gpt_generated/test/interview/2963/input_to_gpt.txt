The goal of this Kata is to return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.   
tl;dr: Return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.   

Being tired of participating in too many Codeforces rounds, Gildong decided to take some rest in a park. He sat down on a bench, and soon he found two rabbits hopping around. One of the rabbits was taller than the other. He noticed that the two rabbits were hopping towards each other. The positions of the two rabbits can be represented as integer coordinates on a horizontal line. The taller rabbit is currently on position $x$, and the shorter rabbit is currently on position $y$ ($x \lt y$). Every second, each rabbit hops to another position. The taller rabbit hops to the positive direction by $a$, and the shorter rabbit hops to the negative direction by $b$.  [Image]  For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, each rabbit will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both rabbits will be at position $4$. Gildong is now wondering: Will the two rabbits be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the rabbits will be at the same point. 
tl;dr: You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$. Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment  If so, how long will it take  Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point. 

Neelix has been working on making the Altonian warp bubble power itself up. While waiting for the system checks to complete, he saw a number on his screen and wondered if there is a number that powers itself up to this number.
