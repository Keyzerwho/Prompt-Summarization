You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string. Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve. 
tl;dr: You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters.You have to replace a one character by other character present in the string so that the string becomes lexicographically smallest.Find that lexicographically smallest  string. 

Chef wants you to distribute candies among $N$ kids who are sitting in a circle. However, he wants to make some kids jealous of others. Thus, he wants you to distribute candies in such a way that there is a difference of at least $K$ candies between two adjacent kids.  Given the value of $N$ and $K$, you need to find the minimum number of candies you need to satisfy the given conditions, such that, each kid gets at least one candy. 
tl;dr: You are given $N$ nodes arranged in a cycle initialised to zero and a difference $K$.  Find and return the minimum number of increments required so that each node is atleast $1$ and adjacent nodes have a difference of is atleast $K$. 

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers numbered from $1$ to $n$. Let's define the $k$-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length $k$ (recall that a subsegment of $a$ of length $k$ is a contiguous part of $a$ containing exactly $k$ elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length $k$ for some value of $k$, then the $k$-amazing number is $-1$. For each $k$ from $1$ to $n$ calculate the $k$-amazing number of the array $a$.

Neelix has been working on making the Altonian warp bubble power itself up. While waiting for the system checks to complete, he saw a number on his screen and wondered if there is a number that powers itself up to this number.
