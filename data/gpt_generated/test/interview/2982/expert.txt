 You are given a list of words, you need to output a sorted list. Comparison should be case sensitive
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^6$), the number of songs Tóti has written. The second line consists of $n$ integers, each in $\{ 1, 2, 3\} $, giving the hype ratings of the $n$ songs in the order they were written. -----Output----- Output the number of setlists Tóti can make. Since this number can be large, print it modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 9 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 Sample Output: 63
