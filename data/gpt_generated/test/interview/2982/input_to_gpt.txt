In this kata, you have to define a function named **func** that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - **[output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation]**, but **you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.**

You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of $n\cdot m$ identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. $\{3$  The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece.  Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.
