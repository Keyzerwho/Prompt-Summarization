 Print the minimum number of quick changes needed for a given recital, given that the order of the dance routines could be changed.  
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $R$, with $2 \leq R \leq 10$, that indicates the number of routines in the recital. Following that will be $R$ additional lines, each describing the dancers for one routine in the form of a nonempty string of up to 26 non-repeating, lexicographically sorted uppercase alphabetic characters identifying the dancers who perform in that routine. Although a dancer’s letter will not appear more than once in a single routine, that dancer may appear in many different routines, and it may be that two or more routines have the identical set of dancers. -----Output----- Output a single integer designating the minimum number of quick changes required for the recital. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 ABC ABEF DEF ABCDE FGH Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 6 BDE FGH DEF ABC BDE ABEF Sample Output 2: 3
