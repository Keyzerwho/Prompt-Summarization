Let us define two functions f and g on positive integer numbers.  $f(n) = \text{product of non-zero digits of} n$ $g(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}{n} & {\text{if} n < 10} \\{g(f(n))} & {\text{otherwise}} \end{array} \right.$  You need to process Q queries. In each query, you will be given three integers l, r and k. You need to print the number of integers x between l and r inclusive, such that g(x) = k.

Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

The Little Elephant has an integer a, written in the binary notation. He wants to write this number on a piece of paper. To make sure that the number a fits on the piece of paper, the Little Elephant ought to delete exactly one any digit from number a in the binary record. At that a new number appears. It consists of the remaining binary digits, written in the corresponding order (possible, with leading zeroes). The Little Elephant wants the number he is going to write on the paper to be as large as possible. Help him find the maximum number that he can obtain after deleting exactly one binary digit and print it in the binary notation. 
tl;dr: Print the maximum number that can be obtained after removing one digit from the given binay number.  

The Production Manager of a dance company has been tasked with determining the cost for the seasonal dance recital. Because of their exceptional skills, many dancers will perform in more than one routine, but this presents a problem; each dance routine incorporates a unique costume, so between routines, dancers must report backstage to a Wardrobe Specialist, who can change the dancer s costume in time to begin their next scheduled routine. A Wardrobe Specialist does a normal change on a dancer when the dancer performs in two routines that are not consecutive, but when a dancer is required to perform in two consecutive routines, a quick change is necessary. A Wardrobe Specialist charges a flat rate per recital that covers all normal changes, but charges an exorbitant amount for each quick change. The Production Manager is responsible for keeping the show under budget, and has hired you to write a program to report the minimum number of quick changes needed for a given recital, given that the order of the dance routines could be changed. To describe the cast of dancers that are to perform during a recital, each dancer is assigned an identifying uppercase letter. (Fortunately, there are never more than 26 dancers, so characters from A to Z suffice.) To describe a full recital, a list of individual routines is given, with a string of characters defining which dancers appear in a routine. For example, consider the following recital description:     ABC ABEF DEF ABCDE FGH The above list describes a recital with 5 dance routines, including a total of 8 individual performers (dancers A through H). The first routine listed includes dancers {A, B, and C}. The second routine includes dancers {A, B, E, and F}. Notice that if these first two routines are performed in the above order, dancers A and B will require a quick change between the routines. In fact, if these five routines are scheduled in the order given above, a total of six quick changes are required. However, the schedule can be rearranged as follows:     ABEF DEF ABC FGH ABCDE In this case, only two quick changes are required (those for E and F between the first two dances).
