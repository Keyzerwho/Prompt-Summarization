There are two buttons on the book which allow Vasya to scroll $d$ pages forwards or backwards (but he cannot scroll outside the book). For example, if the book consists of $10$ pages, and $d = 3$, then from the first page Vasya can scroll to the first or to the fourth page by pressing one of the buttons; from the second page to the first or to the fifth; from the sixth page to the third or to the ninth; from the eighth to the fifth or to the tenth. Help Vasya to calculate the minimum number of times he needs to press a button to move to page $y$.",
