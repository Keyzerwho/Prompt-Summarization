The goal of this Kata is to return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.   
tl;dr: Return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.   

You are given a string S consisting of a,b and c. Find the number of strings that can be possibly obtained by repeatedly performing the following operation zero or more times, modulo 998244353:  - Choose an integer i such that 1\leq i\leq |S|-1 and the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in S are different. Replace each of the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in S with the character that differs from both of them (among a, b and c). -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq |S| \leq 2   10^5  - S consists of a, b and c.

An ironman triathlon is a race where participants swim for $3.86$ km, ride a bicycle for $180.25$ km, and finally run a marathon, and it is considered one of the toughest sport events. Viveka has been training for an even more challenging competition: the $n$-athlon. In an $n$-athlon race, participants have to go from the starting point to the finishing point through several types of terrain: water, sand, ice, asphalt, etc. To make the race more interesting, participants are free to pick the route that they think suits best their abilities. Last year Viveka achieved an epic victory by skating the last $40$ km in $1$ hour over ice, while her arch-rival Veronica was stuck in a tar pit $1$ m from the finishing point. The terrain distribution for this year has been published and now it is your task as the optimization expert in Viveka s team to help her figure out the best route for the race. The competition takes place in a flat area, which we model as the 2D plane, and each type of terrain is shaped as a horizontal strip. Participants are not allowed to leave the race area. You know the position of each strip and Viveka s speed in that type of terrain.
