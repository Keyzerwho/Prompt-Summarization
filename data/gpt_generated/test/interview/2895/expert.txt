 You are given a 2D plane and a list of horizontal strips. Each strip has a position and a speed. Your task is to find the fastest route for Viveka to go from the starting point to the finishing point. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two pairs of decimal numbers $x_ s$, $y_ s$, $x_ f$, $y_ f$, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the starting and finishing point, respectively, in meters. The second line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10000$), the number of layers. The third line contains $n-1$ decimal numbers, the $y$ coordinate of each change between layers. Layers are given in order, that is, $y_ s < y_1 < y_2 < \cdots < y_{n-1} < y_ f$, so the shape of layer $i$ is $(-10000,10000)\times (y_{i-1},y_{i})$. The first and last layers extend only until the $y$ coordinate of the starting and finishing point, this is they have shape $(-10000,10000)\times (y_ s,y_1)$ and $(-10000,10000)\times (y_{n-1},y_ f)$ respectively. The fourth line contains $n$ decimal numbers, Vivekaâ€™s speed in each layer, in meters per second. All decimal numbers have absolute value at most $10^4$ and at most $4$ decimals. -----Output----- Output the minimum time required for Viveka to go from the starting to the finishing point. Your answer should be within absolute or relative error at most $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 0 0 0 100 2 50 5 1 Sample Output: 60
