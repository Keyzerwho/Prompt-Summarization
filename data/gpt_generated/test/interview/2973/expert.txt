 You are given a list of distances and times. The speedometer on Sheila's car might have been placed at an angle. The true speed of Sheila's car is $s+c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant. You need to compute $c$. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), the number of sections in Sheila’s journey, and $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^6$), the total time. This is followed by $n$ lines, each describing one segment of Sheila’s journey. The $i^{\text {th}}$ of these lines contains two integers $d_ i$ ($1 \le d_ i \le 1000$) and $s_ i$ ($|s_ i| \le 1000$), the distance and speedometer reading for the $i^{\text {th}}$ segment of the journey. Time is specified in hours, distance in miles, and speed in miles per hour. -----Output----- Display the constant $c$ in miles per hour. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of less than $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 5 4 -1 4 0 10 3 Sample Output: 3.000000000
