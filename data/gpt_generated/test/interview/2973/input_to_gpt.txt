Find the first character that repeats in a String and return that character.  ```python first_dup('tweet') => 't' first_dup('like') => None ``` *This is not the same as finding the character that repeats first.* *In that case, an input of 'tweet' would yield 'e'.
tl;dr: Find the first character that repeats in a String and return that character.  

Toad Rash has a binary string $s$. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones. Let $n$ be the length of $s$. Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $l$, $r$ that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ and there is at least one pair of integers $x$, $k$ such that $1 \leq x, k \leq n$, $l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$, and $s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$. Find this number of pairs for Rash.

Sheila is a student and she drives a typical student car: it is old, slow, rusty, and falling apart. Recently, the needle on the speedometer fell off. She glued it back on, but she might have placed it at the wrong angle. Thus, when the speedometer reads $s$, her true speed is $s+c$, where $c$ is an unknown constant (possibly negative).  Sheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants to use this to compute $c$. The journey consisted of $n$ segments. In the $i^{\text {th}}$ segment she traveled a distance of $d_ i$ and the speedometer read $s_ i$ for the entire segment. This whole journey took time $t$. Help Sheila by computing $c$. Note that while Sheila s speedometer might have negative readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment of the journey.
