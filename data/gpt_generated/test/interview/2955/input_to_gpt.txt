Given two strings representing two complex numbers. You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition. 
tl;dr: Write program to return a string representing the multiplication of given two  strings of complex numbers. 

## A square of squares You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks! However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain  Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a _perfect square_. ## Task Given an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number): > In mathematics, a __square number__ or __perfect square__ is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. The tests will _always_ use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages. ### 
tl;dr: Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number. 

Pia is getting ready for her flight to the NWERC 2018 in Eindhoven. As she is packing her hard drive, she remembers the airline s ridiculous weight restrictions, which may pose a problem. You see, the hard drive is essentially a string of ones and zeros, and its weight depends on the number of  bit changes  in it: for any two adjacent bits storing two different values, the hard drive gets slightly heavier, so Pia cannot just store arbitrary information on it. To make matters worse, the drive is so old that some bits are already broken and will always store zeros. The first bit will never be broken, but the last bit will always be. Pia decides to treat this situation as a challenge: she is now trying to modify the information on the hard drive so that it has exactly the maximum number of bit changes permitted by the airline. However, the broken bits make this harder than expected, so she needs your help. Find a bit pattern which can be stored on the hard drive and has exactly the desired number of bit changes.
