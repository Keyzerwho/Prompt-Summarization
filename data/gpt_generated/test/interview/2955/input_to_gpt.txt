Dinesh is very fond of sweets recently his aunt Riya gifted him an array $a$ of sweets of size $N$. The ith sweet is of the type $a[i]$. His mother told him that he can choose one type of sweet in a day and eat at most 2 sweets of that type. Since he has to eat all the sweets as quickly as possible because his cousins are arriving. Find out the minimum number of days in which he can eat all the sweets gifted by his aunt Riya.  
tl;dr: You are given an array $a$ of item of size $N$.Only one type of item can be chosen in a day and purchased at most 2 items of that type.Find minimum number of days in which all items are purchased. 

There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

Pia is getting ready for her flight to the NWERC 2018 in Eindhoven. As she is packing her hard drive, she remembers the airline s ridiculous weight restrictions, which may pose a problem. You see, the hard drive is essentially a string of ones and zeros, and its weight depends on the number of  bit changes  in it: for any two adjacent bits storing two different values, the hard drive gets slightly heavier, so Pia cannot just store arbitrary information on it. To make matters worse, the drive is so old that some bits are already broken and will always store zeros. The first bit will never be broken, but the last bit will always be. Pia decides to treat this situation as a challenge: she is now trying to modify the information on the hard drive so that it has exactly the maximum number of bit changes permitted by the airline. However, the broken bits make this harder than expected, so she needs your help. Find a bit pattern which can be stored on the hard drive and has exactly the desired number of bit changes.
