 You are given a string of bits. The number of bit changes in the string is the weight of the string. The first bit will never be broken, but the last bit will always be. You are asked to find a bit pattern which can be stored on the hard drive and has exactly the desired number of bit changes. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with three integers $n$, $c$, and $b$ ($2 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq c, b \le n-1$), the size of the hard drive in bits, the desired amount of bit changes, and the number of broken bits. The positions on the hard drive are numbered from $1$ to $n$.  - One line with $b$ integers $z_1, \ldots , z_ b$ ($2 \leq z_1 < z_2 < \ldots < z_ b = n$), the positions of the broken bits on the hard drive. -----Output----- Output a bit string of length $n$, representing Piaâ€™s hard drive and containing exactly $c$ bit changes. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 2 3 2 3 5 Sample Output: 00010
