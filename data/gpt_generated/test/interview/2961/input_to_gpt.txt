Write a function that gets a sequence and value and returns `true/false` depending on whether the variable exists in a multidimentional sequence. 
tl;dr: Write a function that gets a sequence and value and returns `true` if the variable exists in a multidimentional sequence. 

Error Handling is very important in coding and seems to be overlooked or not implemented properly. #Task Your task is to implement a function which takes a string as input and return an object containing the properties vowels and consonants. The vowels property must contain the total count of vowels {a,e,i,o,u}, and the total count of consonants {a,..,z} - {a,e,i,o,u}. Handle invalid input and don't forget to return valid ones. #Input The input is any random string. You must then discern what are vowels and what are consonants and sum for each category their total occurrences in an object. However you could also receive inputs that are not strings. If this happens then you must return an object with a vowels and consonants total of 0 because the input was NOT a string. Refer to the

The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the home of many students during the school year. The school has many rooms connected by corridors and stairs. Each room has four exits labelled by the integers $1, 2, 3$ or $4$. Some exits lead to another room, some of them are blocked, and some even lead back to the same room you just came from. New students often have difficulty finding their way, especially since the corridors and stairs are regularly moving, disconnecting and reconnecting different rooms! Luckily, these reconfigurations only take place when no one is walking in the school. All you want to know is how to get from the entrance to the dormitory. A senior student has given you instructions as a sequence of numbers among $1, 2, 3, 4$. The first number in the sequence is the exit to take from the starting room. The second number is the exit to take from the second room in the path, and so on. If at any point the indicated exit is blocked, you go back to the entrance and give up. To be successful you must arrive at the dormitory at the end of the entire sequence. Even if it appears you have reached the dormitory before the entire sequence is followed, you are not sure if that is an illusion. Therefore you follow the entire sequence. You carefully followed the instructions and arrived at the dormitory. However, the way the rooms are connected to each other has changed after the senior student gave you the instructions, and you just happen to arrive at the same destination even if the rooms you encountered along the way may be completely different. You wonder if you are just lucky, or if the reconfiguration of the corridors and stairs ensures that the instructions still lead you to the same destination. Isn t that magical  You will be given a configuration of the school when the senior student walked from the entrance to the dormitory, as well as the configuration of the school when you start following the given instructions. You want to know if every possible sequence of instructions that led the senior student to the dormitory will also lead you to the dormitory in the configuration you walk through. Both the senior student and you start walking from the entrance of the school.
