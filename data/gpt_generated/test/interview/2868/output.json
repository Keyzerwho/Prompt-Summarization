            "text": " Little Marin spent all his day generating test data for COCI. He simply couldn t make it work, so he had a nervous breakdown and can t even see clearly anymore. Every time he blinks while reading, the letters in a word get mixed up so that the letters from the second half of the word (the shorter half, if the length is an odd number)  jump in  between the letters from the first half in the following way:  - the last letter  jumps in  between the first and the second letter  - the penultimate letter  jumps in  between the second and the third letter  - the $k$-th letter from the end  jumps in  between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-th letter from the beginning For example, the word  abcdef  would become  afbecd  after blinking. If Marin blinks again, the same thing happens. After two blinks, the word  abcdef  becomes  adfcbe . Marin has decided to write a program to help him determine what s exactly written on the screen. Unfortunately, after a day s work, he s simply too tired and he needs your help. You are given $X$, the number of blinks, and the word Marin sees on the screen. Write a program to solve the mystery for Marin and determine what was actually the word before he blinked $X$ times. ",
