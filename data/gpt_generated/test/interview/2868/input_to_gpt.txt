# Task  CodeBots decided to make a gift for CodeMaster's birthday. They got a pack of candies of various sizes from the store, but instead of giving the whole pack they are trying to make the biggest possible candy from them. On each turn it is possible:    ```  to pick any two candies of the same size and merge  them into a candy which will be two times bigger;  to pick a single candy of an even size and split it   into two equal candies half of this size each.``` What is the size of the biggest candy they can make as a gift  #

It is lunch time for Mole. His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for lunch. Marmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile contains a_{i} worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a_1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers a_1 + 1 to a_1 + a_2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding. Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained. Poor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.

Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

Little Marin spent all his day generating test data for COCI. He simply couldn t make it work, so he had a nervous breakdown and can t even see clearly anymore. Every time he blinks while reading, the letters in a word get mixed up so that the letters from the second half of the word (the shorter half, if the length is an odd number)  jump in  between the letters from the first half in the following way:  - the last letter  jumps in  between the first and the second letter  - the penultimate letter  jumps in  between the second and the third letter  - the $k$-th letter from the end  jumps in  between the $k$-th and the $(k+1)$-th letter from the beginning For example, the word  abcdef  would become  afbecd  after blinking. If Marin blinks again, the same thing happens. After two blinks, the word  abcdef  becomes  adfcbe . Marin has decided to write a program to help him determine what s exactly written on the screen. Unfortunately, after a day s work, he s simply too tired and he needs your help. You are given $X$, the number of blinks, and the word Marin sees on the screen. Write a program to solve the mystery for Marin and determine what was actually the word before he blinked $X$ times.
