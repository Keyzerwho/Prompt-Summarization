 You are given a list of $n$ integers. The first integer is the number of frames, the second integer is the number of millimeters the mug has moved between the first and the second frame. Find two frames between which the mug has moved exactly $D$ millimeters. 
-----Input----- The input file contains the single positive integer $D\leq 200000$, the distance to be measured. -----Output----- Output two non-negative integers $n_1$ and $n_2$, the numbers of the frames that Susan should compare. They should fulfill $n_2^2-n_1^2=D$. If no two such integers exist, instead output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 88 Sample Output: 9 13
