 You are given a video of a falling coffee mug. The camera was filming at a speed of $70$ frames per second, which means that at frame $n$, counted from when the mug was released, the number of millimeters it has moved is $d=n^2$. The counting of the frames starts at $0$. You need to find two frames between which the mug has moved exactly this distance. 

-----Input----- The input file contains the single positive integer $D\leq 200000$, the distance to be measured. -----Output----- Output two non-negative integers $n_1$ and $n_2$, the numbers of the frames that Susan should compare. They should fulfill $n_2^2-n_1^2=D$. If no two such integers exist, instead output “impossible”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 88 Sample Output: 9 13
