 You are given a list. Each element represent a 2D point. Return the time needed to move all points in front of points. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a sequence of letters without spaces s_1s_2... s_{n} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), consisting of capital English letters M and F. If letter s_{i} equals M, that means that initially, the line had a boy on the i-th position. If letter s_{i} equals F, then initially the line had a girl on the i-th position. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the number of seconds needed to move all the girls in the line in front of the boys. If the line has only boys or only girls, print 0. -----Examples----- Input MFM Output 1 Input MMFF Output 3 Input FFMMM Output 0 -----Note----- In the first test case the sequence of changes looks as follows: MFM  →  FMM. The second test sample corresponds to the sample from the statement. The sequence of changes is: MMFF  →  MFMF  →  FMFM  →  FFMM.
