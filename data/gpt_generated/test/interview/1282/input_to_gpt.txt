A transaction is possibly invalid if: the amount exceeds $1000, or; if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city. Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction. Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.   
tl;dr: You are given a list of strings where each string in format of "A,B,C,D". where A,D are strings and B,C are numbers. A string is possibly invalid if: the C exceeds 1000, or; if two strings have same A and different D and the difference between C is greater than or equal to 60. return list of strings which are possibley invalid in any order 

Given that  ``` f0 = '0' f1 = '01' f2 = '010' = f1 + f0 f3 = '01001' = f2 + f1 ``` You will be given a number and your task is to return the `nth` fibonacci string. For example: ``` solve(2) = '010' solve(3) = '01001' ``` More examples in test cases. Good luck!

tl;dr: You will be given a number and your task is to return the nth fibonacci string. 

You have a very large square wall and a circular dartboard placed on the wall. You have been challenged to throw darts into the board blindfolded. Darts thrown at the wall are represented as an array of points on a 2D plane.  Return the maximum number of points that are within or lie on any circular dartboard of radius r.   
tl;dr: you are given a list. each element represent a 2D point. Return the maximum number of points that are inside a circle of radius r. 

There are n schoolchildren, boys and girls, lined up in the school canteen in front of the bun stall. The buns aren't ready yet and the line is undergoing some changes. Each second all boys that stand right in front of girls, simultaneously swap places with the girls (so that the girls could go closer to the beginning of the line). In other words, if at some time the i-th position has a boy and the (i + 1)-th position has a girl, then in a second, the i-th position will have a girl and the (i + 1)-th one will have a boy. Let's take an example of a line of four people: a boy, a boy, a girl, a girl (from the beginning to the end of the line). Next second the line will look like that: a boy, a girl, a boy, a girl. Next second it will be a girl, a boy, a girl, a boy. Next second it will be a girl, a girl, a boy, a boy. The line won't change any more. Your task is: given the arrangement of the children in the line to determine the time needed to move all girls in front of boys (in the example above it takes 3 seconds). Baking buns takes a lot of time, so no one leaves the line until the line stops changing.
