Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input. 
tl;dr: Your task is to write a function get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) which returns a dictionary {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} 

You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers. For instance, if we are given an array $[10, 20, 30, 40]$, we can permute it so that it becomes $[20, 40, 10, 30]$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($20>10$, $40>20$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $2$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case. Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal.

Chef is very organised in whatever he does and likes to maintain statistics of his work. Chef has expertise in web development and hence is a regular contributor on a forum. Chef sometimes makes multiple contributions in a single day.. Each day chef makes at least 1 contribution he is assigned a shade of green. The greater the number of contribution in a single day the darker shade of green he gets assigned and vice versa. Your job is to find out the number of days chef is assigned a same shade of green and print the number of times chef is assigned a unique shade of green. -----INPUT----- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of days chef has contributed towards the forum. The next line contains N spaced integers the number of contributions chef has made if he has made any. -----OUTPUT----- The output will contain numbers on separate lines that show the number of individual green shades chef has earned in ascending order of intensity of the shades of green. -----CONSTRAINTS----- 1 <= T <= 25 5 <= N <= 50 1 <= Ai <= 50 -----EXAMPLE

The next line contains N spaced integers the number of contributions chef has made if he has made any. -----OUTPUT----- The output will contain numbers on separate lines that show the number of individual green shades chef has earned in ascending order of intensity of the shades of green. -----CONSTRAINTS----- 1 <= T <= 25 5 <= N <= 50 1 <= Ai <= 50 -----EXAMPLE

Mafia is a social game played frequently by high school competitors in informatics on summer and winter camps and national competitions, usually very late at night, drinking various fruit sodas. This game is not about winning, it s about los taking part, like in competitions. To solve this task, you don t need to know the rules of mafia: all you need to know is that some of the players are  mobsters  and the rest are  civilians . The mobsters know who is who, but the civilians don t. The civilians are trying to figure out who the mobsters are during the game. In the current round of the game, out of $N$ surviving players so far, each one has accused exactly one other player saying that he is the mobster. The civilians were only guessing and the mobsters have accused civilians, pretending to know nothing. Not knowing who the mobsters are, but knowing who accused whom, determine the maximum possible number of mobsters among these players!
