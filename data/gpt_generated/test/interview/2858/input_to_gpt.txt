Han Solo and Chewbacca start a space journey to planet Naboo on the Millennium Falcon. During the journey they land at a mysterious planet with high gravity where they find n diamond stones scattered all around. All the stones are of same weight. Each stone has a value according to its purity which can be detected by a special device. They choose to divide the stones fairly among themselves in two halves so that they carry almost equal weights such that the difference between the value of two halves is as small as possible. If n is even, then sizes of two halves must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd, then size of one half must be (n-1)/2 and size of the other half must be (n+1)/2. Given the value of stones, help them to divide the stones among themselves. 
tl;dr: Given a set of n numbers, divide them into subsets of sizes at most different by 1, such that difference in the sum of numbers in each subset is minimum. 

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the $k$ TV shows. You know the schedule for the next $n$ days: a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le k$), where $a_i$ is the show, the episode of which will be shown in $i$-th day. The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately. How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows $d$ ($1 \le d \le n$) days in a row  In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of $d$ consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Mafia is a social game played frequently by high school competitors in informatics on summer and winter camps and national competitions, usually very late at night, drinking various fruit sodas. This game is not about winning, it s about los taking part, like in competitions. To solve this task, you don t need to know the rules of mafia: all you need to know is that some of the players are  mobsters  and the rest are  civilians . The mobsters know who is who, but the civilians don t. The civilians are trying to figure out who the mobsters are during the game. In the current round of the game, out of $N$ surviving players so far, each one has accused exactly one other player saying that he is the mobster. The civilians were only guessing and the mobsters have accused civilians, pretending to know nothing. Not knowing who the mobsters are, but knowing who accused whom, determine the maximum possible number of mobsters among these players!
