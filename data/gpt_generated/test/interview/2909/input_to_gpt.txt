Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. $1$ represents an apple and $0$ represents an orange. Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest contiguous sequence of apples. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of apples in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$.  Help Zookeeper find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$, or the sum of $f$ across all substrings. 
tl;dr: Given a sequence, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of $1$ in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$.  Find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$. 

Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input. 
tl;dr: Your task is to write a function get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) which returns a dictionary {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} 

Michael works in a bakery. At the end of his shift, his boss wants the breads sorted in a certain order. She can t seem to decide on which order, though   every day there seems to be a new one   to Michael s despair. Michael has worked there for a while now and has learned a neat trick with his wooden bakery paddle. He can take three breads next to each other on his paddle and throw them up in the air such that when they land, the right-most has moved to the left-most position, and the two other breads have moved one place to the right. In other words, he can rotate to the right a subsequence of breads of length three. Before the end of the shift, his coworkers place the breads in a long line. Michael would like to sort the line of breads using his paddle trick. He can take any three consecutive breads along the line on his paddle, rotate them, and then put them back. Sometimes though, it does not matter how many times he uses his paddle   the line of bread just doesn t seem to be possible to sort the way the boss wants
