A transaction is possibly invalid if: the amount exceeds $1000, or; if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city. Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction. Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.   
tl;dr: You are given a list of strings where each string in format of "A,B,C,D". where A,D are strings and B,C are numbers. A string is possibly invalid if: the C exceeds 1000, or; if two strings have same A and different D and the difference between C is greater than or equal to 60. return list of strings which are possibley invalid in any order 

Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order. For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5] Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6

Michael works in a bakery. At the end of his shift, his boss wants the breads sorted in a certain order. She can t seem to decide on which order, though   every day there seems to be a new one   to Michael s despair. Michael has worked there for a while now and has learned a neat trick with his wooden bakery paddle. He can take three breads next to each other on his paddle and throw them up in the air such that when they land, the right-most has moved to the left-most position, and the two other breads have moved one place to the right. In other words, he can rotate to the right a subsequence of breads of length three. Before the end of the shift, his coworkers place the breads in a long line. Michael would like to sort the line of breads using his paddle trick. He can take any three consecutive breads along the line on his paddle, rotate them, and then put them back. Sometimes though, it does not matter how many times he uses his paddle   the line of bread just doesn t seem to be possible to sort the way the boss wants
