On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations: Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or; Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display. Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X. Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.   
tl;dr: You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   

Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees. 
tl;dr: You are given three angles of a triangle.Check whether these angles form a valid triangle or not.

Punctual City is well known for the punctuality of its citizens and its public transportation system. It is particularly famous for its train system. It is always on time, and never too late (or even too early). Statistics about train boarding is regularly collected to keep things running smoothly. A train has cars numbered $1$ to $N$ (from front to back), each of length $L$ meters. Each car has exactly one door for boarding located at the center ($L/2$ meters from each end of the car). There are no gaps between cars. When the train stops at the boarding platform, each passenger waiting for the train walks to the door of the car which is closest to them, taking the higher numbered car in the case of a tie. Given the location of the passengers relative to the train, help the city by reporting the longest distance that any passenger has to walk and the maximum number of passengers boarding any single car.
