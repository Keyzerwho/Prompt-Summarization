 Given the locations of passengers and the train, find the longest distance any passenger has to walk and the maximum number of passengers boarding any single car.

-----Input----- The first line of input contains three integers $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$), which is the number of cars of the train, $L$ ($2 \leq L \leq 100$), which is the length of each car, and $P$ ($1 \leq P \leq 1000$), which is the number of passengers waiting for the train. It is guaranteed that $L$ is an even number. The next $P$ lines describe the location of the passengers relative to the train. Each line contains a single integer $x$ ($0 \leq x \leq 10000$), which is the distance the passenger is behind the front-end of the train. -----Output----- Display the longest distance that any passenger has to walk on one line. On the next line, display the maximum number of passengers boarding any single car. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 68 90 6 3809 288 2306 2215 4211 379 Sample Output: 27 1
