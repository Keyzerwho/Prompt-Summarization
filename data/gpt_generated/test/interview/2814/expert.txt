 Concentration is a not so popular 2 player card game of both skill and luck. The standard Concentration game is played with one or two 52-card decks, however, for the sake of the problem, we will look at a variation of Concentration. The rules are as follows: 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer $1\leq N\leq 10^6$. The second line contains $2N$ integers, with the $i$-th integer being $\sigma _0(i)$. This line defines $\sigma _0$. The third line contains $2N$ integers, with the $i$-th integer being $\sigma _1(i)$. This line defines $\sigma _1$. -----Output----- Output a single line with $0$ if Anthony wins, $1$ if Matthew wins, or $-1$ if the game ties. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 0 1 2 3  0 1 2 3  Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 2 0 2 1 3  0 2 1 3  Sample Output 2: 1
