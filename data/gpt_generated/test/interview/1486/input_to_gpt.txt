Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path. You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.

A subsequence of a string S is a string that can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from S without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, arc, artistic and (an empty string) are all subsequences of artistic; abc and ci are not. You are given a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Find the shortest string among the strings consisting of lowercase English letters that are not subsequences of A. If there are more than one such string, find the lexicographically smallest one among them. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |A| \leq 2 \times 10^5  - A consists of lowercase English letters.

Jeff's friends know full well that the boy likes to get sequences and arrays for his birthday. Thus, Jeff got sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} for his birthday. Jeff hates inversions in sequences. An inversion in sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a pair of indexes i, j (1   i < j   n), such that an inequality a_{i} > a_{j} holds. Jeff can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. At that, he wants the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Help Jeff and find the minimum number of inversions he manages to get.

All cities of Lineland are located on the Ox coordinate axis. Thus, each city is associated with its position x_{i}   a coordinate on the Ox axis. No two cities are located at a single point. Lineland residents love to send letters to each other. A person may send a letter only if the recipient lives in another city (because if they live in the same city, then it is easier to drop in). Strange but true, the cost of sending the letter is exactly equal to the distance between the sender's city and the recipient's city. For each city calculate two values   min_{i} and max_{i}, where min_{i} is the minimum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city to some other city, and max_{i} is the the maximum cost of sending a letter from the i-th city to some other city
