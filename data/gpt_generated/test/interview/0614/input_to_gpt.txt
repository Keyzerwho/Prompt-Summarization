# Story Due to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face. And because the local council has lost most of our tax money to a Nigerian email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly.  Instead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand! What a bunch of cheapskates! Can you do it  # Kata Given the ```angle``` (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format. Round _down_ to the nearest minute. # 
tl;dr: Given the angle of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format and round down to the nearest minute. 0 <= angle <= 360 # 

You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.  Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1. Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence. 
tl;dr: You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.  Calculate how many different strings T of length n can be composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of Longest Common Subsequence between S and T is n - 1. 

Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x. You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party  Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter. 
tl;dr: Calculate the number of different collisions if a matrix N x M of N boys and M girls are given where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0 and collison occurs when two boys like the same girl.  

After several latest reforms many tourists are planning to visit Berland, and Berland people understood that it's an opportunity to earn money and changed their jobs to attract tourists. Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market. This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight w_{i} and cost c_{i}. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible. Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.
