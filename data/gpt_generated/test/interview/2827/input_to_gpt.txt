The life goes up and down, just like nice sequences. Sequence t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} is called nice if the following two conditions are satisfied:   t_{i} < t_{i} + 1 for each odd i < n;  t_{i} > t_{i} + 1 for each even i < n.  For example, sequences (2, 8), (1, 5, 1) and (2, 5, 1, 100, 99, 120) are nice, while (1, 1), (1, 2, 3) and (2, 5, 3, 2) are not. Bear Limak has a sequence of positive integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n}. This sequence is not nice now and Limak wants to fix it by a single swap. He is going to choose two indices i < j and swap elements t_{i} and t_{j} in order to get a nice sequence. Count the number of ways to do so. Two ways are considered different if indices of elements chosen for a swap are different. 
tl;dr: Sequence t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} is called nice if the following two conditions are satisfied:   t_{i} < t_{i} + 1 for each odd i < n;  t_{i} > t_{i} + 1 for each even i < n.  You have a sequence of positive integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n}. This sequence is not nice now and you want to fix it by a single swap. Count the number of ways to do so. Two ways are considered different if indices of elements chosen for a swap are different. 

Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

# Story Due to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face. And because the local council has lost most of our tax money to a Nigerian email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly.  Instead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand! What a bunch of cheapskates! Can you do it  # Kata Given the ```angle``` (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format. Round _down_ to the nearest minute. # 
tl;dr: Given the angle of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format and round down to the nearest minute. 0 <= angle <= 360 # 

You are part of an elite hacking group who has just invented a new type of malware, called the hoppers. Hoppers can operate in any high-security computer networks; however, they can only propagate themselves in a very limited way. A computer network is a set of hosts $V$ ($|V| = N$) and direct links $E$ ($|E| = M$). Each direct link connects two different hosts, allowing them to communicate in both directions. If a host $u$ is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate itself to all hosts $W$ where $W$ is the set of hosts which are connected to any neighbor of $u$. Formally, $W = \{ w \mid \{ (u,v),(v,w)\} \subseteq E \} $. The newly-infected host $w$ can now proceed to infect other hosts in the same manner. You are trying to infect all hosts in a particular high-security network by compromising a single host. Of course, a compromised host will be infected with a hopper. Though it may be an impossible mission, you realize that you can trick the administrator into installing new direct links between hosts by submitting IT requests. Too many requests may arouse suspicion. Find the minimum number of IT requests you have to submit to ensure that there exists a single host such that if it is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate to the entire network.
