You are given integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied: For every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $2n$ numbers differ not more than by $1$. For example, choose $n = 3$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, $4 + 5 + 2 = 11$, $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$, $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$, $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$, $6 + 1 + 4 = 11$, any two numbers differ by at most $1$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $5 + 1 + 6 = 12$, and $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$, $9$ and $12$ differ more than by $1$.  [Image]  
tl;dr: Given an integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, such that sum of every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle must not differ more than by $1$. 

There is an integer sequence of length 2^N: A_0, A_1, ..., A_{2^N-1}. (Note that the sequence is 0-indexed.) For every integer K satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 2^N-1, solve the following problem:  - Let i and j be integers. Find the maximum value of A_i + A_j where 0 \leq i < j \leq 2^N-1 and (i or j) \leq K. Here, or denotes the bitwise OR. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 18  - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9  - All values in input are integers.

You are part of an elite hacking group who has just invented a new type of malware, called the hoppers. Hoppers can operate in any high-security computer networks; however, they can only propagate themselves in a very limited way. A computer network is a set of hosts $V$ ($|V| = N$) and direct links $E$ ($|E| = M$). Each direct link connects two different hosts, allowing them to communicate in both directions. If a host $u$ is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate itself to all hosts $W$ where $W$ is the set of hosts which are connected to any neighbor of $u$. Formally, $W = \{ w \mid \{ (u,v),(v,w)\} \subseteq E \} $. The newly-infected host $w$ can now proceed to infect other hosts in the same manner. You are trying to infect all hosts in a particular high-security network by compromising a single host. Of course, a compromised host will be infected with a hopper. Though it may be an impossible mission, you realize that you can trick the administrator into installing new direct links between hosts by submitting IT requests. Too many requests may arouse suspicion. Find the minimum number of IT requests you have to submit to ensure that there exists a single host such that if it is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate to the entire network.
