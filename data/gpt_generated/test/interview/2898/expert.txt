 Given a list of drives and their capacities. Find the minimum capacity of an extra drive needed to reformat all the drives.
-----Input----- The input begins with a line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), which is the number of drives in your cluster. Following this are $n$ lines, each describing a drive as two integers $a$ and $b$, where $a$ is the capacity with the old file system and $b$ is the capacity with the new file system. All capacities are given in gigabytes and satisfy $1 \le a,b \le 10^9$. (One thousand petabytes should be enough for everyone, right?) -----Output----- Display the total extra capacity in gigabytes you must buy to reformat the drives. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 6 6 1 7 3 5 3 5 Sample Output: 1
