Chef recently learned about ratios and proportions. He wrote some positive integers a, b, c, d on a paper. Chef wants to know whether he can shuffle these numbers so as to make some proportion  Formally, four numbers x, y, z, w are said to make a proportion if ratio of x : y is same as that of z : w. 
tl;dr: You have to shuffle digits of the given proportion(x : y :: z : w) in order to check that is it possible to make new proportion or not. 

In the computer world, use restricted resource you have to generate maximum benefit is what we always want to pursue. For now, suppose you are a dominator of m 0s and n 1s respectively. On the other hand, there is an array with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s. Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once. 
tl;dr: You are given numbers m and n. You are given an array of strings of only 0's and 1's. Return the maximum number of strings that can be formed by using less than (m+1) 0's and (n+1) 1's in total. 

A group of friends snuck away from their school campus, but now they must return from the main campus gate to their dorm while remaining undetected by the many teachers who patrol the campus. Fortunately, they have an invisibility cloak, but it is only large enough to cover two people at a time. They will take turns as individuals or pairs traveling across campus under the cloak (and by necessity, returning the cloak to the gate if others remain). Each student has a maximum pace at which he or she is able to travel, yet if a pair of students are walking under the cloak together, they will have to travel at the pace of the slower of the two. Their goal is to have everyone back at the dorm as quickly as possible. As an example, assume that there are four people in the group, with person A able to make the trip in $1$ minute, person B able to travel in $2$ minutes, person C able to travel in $7$ minutes, and person D able to travel in $10$ minutes. It is possible to get everyone to the dorm in $17$ minutes with the following plan:   A and B go from the gate to the dorm together (taking $2$ minutes)   A returns with the cloak to the gate (taking $1$ minute)   C and D go from the gate to the dorm together (taking $10$ minutes)   B returns with the cloak to the gate (taking $2$ minutes)   A and B go from the gate to the dorm together (taking $2$ minutes)
