Karlsson has recently discovered a huge stock of berry jam jars in the basement of the house. More specifically, there were $2n$ jars of strawberry and blueberry jam. All the $2n$ jars are arranged in a row. The stairs to the basement are exactly in the middle of that row. So when Karlsson enters the basement, he sees exactly $n$ jars to his left and $n$ jars to his right. For example, the basement might look like this: [Image]  Being the starightforward man he is, he immediately starts eating the jam. In one minute he chooses to empty either the first non-empty jar to his left or the first non-empty jar to his right. Finally, Karlsson decided that at the end the amount of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.  Jars are numbered from $1$ to $2n$ from left to right, so Karlsson initially stands between jars $n$ and $n+1$. What is the minimum number of jars Karlsson is required to empty so that an equal number of full strawberry and blueberry jam jars is left  Your program should answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: There were $2n$ values of A and B arranged in a list. You should start at the middle of the list. $n$ values to the left and $n$ values to the right. You can choose to make a value zero from either the first non-zero value to left or the first non-zero value to right. Finally, at the end the number of A's and B's should become the same. For example, this might be the result: [Image] He has eaten $1$ jar to his left and then $5$ jars to his right. There remained exactly $3$ full jars of both strawberry and blueberry jam.

You have initially a string of N characters, denoted by A1,A2...AN. You have to print the size of the largest subsequence of string A such that all the characters in that subsequence are distinct ie. no two characters in that subsequence should be same. A subsequence of string A is a sequence that can be derived from A by deleting some elements  and without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
tl;dr: You have to remove duplicates and print the length of unique characters of the given string. 

Given a string s. Can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character  Note that size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before.  
tl;dr: Your task is to determine whether a palindrome can be made or not by deleting only one character from the given string s. 

A group of friends snuck away from their school campus, but now they must return from the main campus gate to their dorm while remaining undetected by the many teachers who patrol the campus. Fortunately, they have an invisibility cloak, but it is only large enough to cover two people at a time. They will take turns as individuals or pairs traveling across campus under the cloak (and by necessity, returning the cloak to the gate if others remain). Each student has a maximum pace at which he or she is able to travel, yet if a pair of students are walking under the cloak together, they will have to travel at the pace of the slower of the two. Their goal is to have everyone back at the dorm as quickly as possible. As an example, assume that there are four people in the group, with person A able to make the trip in $1$ minute, person B able to travel in $2$ minutes, person C able to travel in $7$ minutes, and person D able to travel in $10$ minutes. It is possible to get everyone to the dorm in $17$ minutes with the following plan:   A and B go from the gate to the dorm together (taking $2$ minutes)   A returns with the cloak to the gate (taking $1$ minute)   C and D go from the gate to the dorm together (taking $10$ minutes)   B returns with the cloak to the gate (taking $2$ minutes)   A and B go from the gate to the dorm together (taking $2$ minutes)
