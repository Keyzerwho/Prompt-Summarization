You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

Kontti language is a finnish word play game. You add `-kontti` to the end of each word and then swap their characters until and including the first vowel ("aeiouy");  For example the word `tame` becomes `kome-tantti`; `fruity` becomes `koity-fruntti` and so on. If no vowel is present, the word stays the same. Write a string method that turns a sentence into kontti language

You have located a major supply line that the enemy has been using. With satellite imaging, you ve been able to determine the current location and velocity of every vehicle along the supply line, which is for all practical purposes an infinitely long straight line. Furthermore, you know that each vehicle moves at constant velocity, and that they can pass by each other without incident along this supply line. What you need to do now is deploy an air drone with special sensors that can give you readings of the contents of the vehicles. The sensor is capable of reading everything in its range instantaneously, but power limitations allow it to do so only once. In order to minimize the required range, you want to deploy it when the vehicles are as close to each other as possible. Given knowledge of the current location and velocity of all the vehicles, what is the closest that the vehicles will get to each other
