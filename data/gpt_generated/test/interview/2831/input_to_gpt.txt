Stuart is obsessed to numbers. He like all type of numbers in fact he is having a great collection of numbers in his room. His collection includes N different large numbers. But today he is searching for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X. Numbers are large so he can t do the task on his own. Help him to find a number having maximum frequency of digit X. 
tl;dr: Write a code to search for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X in given different numbers.  

Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value  If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

You have located a major supply line that the enemy has been using. With satellite imaging, you ve been able to determine the current location and velocity of every vehicle along the supply line, which is for all practical purposes an infinitely long straight line. Furthermore, you know that each vehicle moves at constant velocity, and that they can pass by each other without incident along this supply line. What you need to do now is deploy an air drone with special sensors that can give you readings of the contents of the vehicles. The sensor is capable of reading everything in its range instantaneously, but power limitations allow it to do so only once. In order to minimize the required range, you want to deploy it when the vehicles are as close to each other as possible. Given knowledge of the current location and velocity of all the vehicles, what is the closest that the vehicles will get to each other
