You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string. Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve. 
tl;dr: You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters.You have to replace a one character by other character present in the string so that the string becomes lexicographically smallest.Find that lexicographically smallest  string. 

You are given a sequence of $n$ digits $d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}$. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:  each digit is painted either in the color $1$ or in the color $2$;  if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $1$, and then after them all the digits painted in the color $2$, then the resulting sequence of $n$ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).  For example, for the sequence $d=914$ the only valid coloring is $211$ (paint in the color $1$ two last digits, paint in the color $2$ the first digit). But $122$ is not a valid coloring ($9$ concatenated with $14$ is not a non-decreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

Lisa works as a waitress in a restaurant. Tonight is her birthday so Lisa asked the chef to prepare his special meal for her friends. The chef s meal is made of $N$ ingredients. To prepare one serving of the meal he needs a certain amount of each ingredient. There are some ingredients already available in the kitchen and Lisa will buy the rest at the grocery store. The store has all the necessary ingredients, each coming in smaller and larger packages. Lisa has $M$ dollars and wants to spend them so that the chef can make the most servings of his meal. For example, consider the first sample data below. For $99$ dollars Lisa will buy three smaller and one larger package of the first ingredient, as well as one smaller and two larger packages of the second ingredient $(3\cdot 10 + 1 \cdot 11 + 1 \cdot 10 + 2 \cdot 24 = 99)$. The chef will then have $51$ units $(8 + 3 \cdot 10 + 1 \cdot 13)$ of the first ingredient and $60$ units $(20 + 1 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 17)$ of the second ingredient, enough for $5$ servings.
