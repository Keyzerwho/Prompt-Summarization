Then, we will define the following:  - R_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in red  - R_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in red  - B_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in blue  - B_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in blue Find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) \\times (B_{max} - B_{min}). -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   200,000  - 1   x_i, y_i   10^9 ",
