 There are N bags, each containing two white balls. The i-th box contains two balls with integers x_i and y_i written on them, respectively. For each of these bags, you will paint one of the balls red, and paint the other blue. Afterwards, the 2N balls will be classified according to color. Then, we will define the following:  - R_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in red  - R_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in red  - B_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in blue  - B_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in blue Find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) \times (B_{max} - B_{min}). -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   200,000  - 1   x_i, y_i   10^9 
-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) representing the number of individual dolls in the row. The second line contains $n$ positive integers specifying the sizes of the dolls in the order they appear in the row. Each size is between $1$ and $500$ inclusive. -----Output----- Display the minimum number of openings required when reassembling the matryoshka sets. If reassembling cannot be done (some of the kids might have been excessively zealous and taken some dolls), display the word impossible. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 7 1 2 3 2 4 1 3 Sample Output: 7
