 You are given a road network on a continent. Find the minimum range of the car so that it is possible for the car to travel between any two cities on the continent. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains two nonnegative integers $n$ and $m$, the number of cities and roads. Each of these integers is no larger than one million. The cities are numbered from 0 to $n-1$. The first line is followed by $m$ more lines, each describing a road. Each such line contains three non-negative integers. The first two integers are the numbers of the two cities connected by the road. The third integer is the length of the road, a positive integer no larger than $10^9$. -----Output----- For each road network, output a line containing one integer, the minimum range of the car that enables it to drive from every city to every other city. If it is not possible to drive from some city to some other city regardless of the range of the car, instead output a line containing the word IMPOSSIBLE. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 0 1 3 1 2 4 2 1 5 Sample Output: 4
