There is an integer sequence of length 2^N: A_0, A_1, ..., A_{2^N-1}. (Note that the sequence is 0-indexed.) For every integer K satisfying 1 \leq K \leq 2^N-1, solve the following problem:  - Let i and j be integers. Find the maximum value of A_i + A_j where 0 \leq i < j \leq 2^N-1 and (i or j) \leq K. Here, or denotes the bitwise OR. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 18  - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9  - All values in input are integers.

You're playing a game called Osu! Here's a simplified version of it. There are n clicks in a game. For each click there are two outcomes: correct or bad. Let us denote correct as "O", bad as "X", then the whole play can be encoded as a sequence of n characters "O" and "X". Using the play sequence you can calculate the score for the play as follows: for every maximal consecutive "O"s block, add the square of its length (the number of characters "O") to the score. For example, if your play can be encoded as "OOXOOOXXOO", then there's three maximal consecutive "O"s block "OO", "OOO", "OO", so your score will be 2^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 17. If there are no correct clicks in a play then the score for the play equals to 0. You know that the probability to click the i-th (1   i   n) click correctly is p_{i}. In other words, the i-th character in the play sequence has p_{i} probability to be "O", 1 - p_{i} to be "X". You task is to calculate the expected score for your play.

These days, many carmakers are developing cars that run on electricity instead of gasoline. The batteries used in these cars are generally very heavy and expensive, so designers must make an important tradeoffs when determining the battery capacity, and therefore the range, of these vehicles. Your task is to help determine the minimum range necessary so that it is possible for the car to travel between any two cities on the continent. The road network on the continent consists of cities connected by bidirectional roads of different lengths. Each city contains a charging station. Along a route between two cities, the car may pass through any number of cities, but the distance between each pair of consecutive cities along the route must be no longer than the range of the car. What is the minimum range of the car so that there is a route satisfying this constraint between every pair of cities on the continent
