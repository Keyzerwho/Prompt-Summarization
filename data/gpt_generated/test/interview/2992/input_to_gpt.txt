Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n. 
tl;dr: Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique binary search trees that store values 1 ... n. 

You are given a string S consisting of a,b and c. Find the number of strings that can be possibly obtained by repeatedly performing the following operation zero or more times, modulo 998244353:  - Choose an integer i such that 1\leq i\leq |S|-1 and the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in S are different. Replace each of the i-th and (i+1)-th characters in S with the character that differs from both of them (among a, b and c). -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq |S| \leq 2   10^5  - S consists of a, b and c.

Stuart is obsessed to numbers. He like all type of numbers in fact he is having a great collection of numbers in his room. His collection includes N different large numbers. But today he is searching for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X. Numbers are large so he can t do the task on his own. Help him to find a number having maximum frequency of digit X. 
tl;dr: Write a code to search for a number which is having maximum frequency of digit X in given different numbers.  

These days, many carmakers are developing cars that run on electricity instead of gasoline. The batteries used in these cars are generally very heavy and expensive, so designers must make an important tradeoffs when determining the battery capacity, and therefore the range, of these vehicles. Your task is to help determine the minimum range necessary so that it is possible for the car to travel between any two cities on the continent. The road network on the continent consists of cities connected by bidirectional roads of different lengths. Each city contains a charging station. Along a route between two cities, the car may pass through any number of cities, but the distance between each pair of consecutive cities along the route must be no longer than the range of the car. What is the minimum range of the car so that there is a route satisfying this constraint between every pair of cities on the continent
