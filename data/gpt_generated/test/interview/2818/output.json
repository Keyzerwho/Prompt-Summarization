He shoots an arrow from the left to the right side of the room from an arbitrary height he chooses. The arrow moves from left to right, at a chosen height $H$ until it finds a balloon. The moment when an arrow touches a balloon, the balloon pops and disappears and the arrow continues its way from left to right at a height decreased by $1$. Therefore, if the arrow was moving at height $H$, after popping the balloon it travels on height $H-1$. Our hero s goal is to pop all the balloons using as little arrows as possible.",
