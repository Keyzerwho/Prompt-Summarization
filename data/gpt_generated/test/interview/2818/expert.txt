Each integer $H_ i$ ($1 \leq H_ i \leq 1\ 000\ 000$) is the height at which the $i$-th balloon floats, respectively from left to right. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain the minimal number of times Pero needs to shoot an arrow so that all balloons are popped. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 2 1 5 4 3 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 5 1 2 3 4 5 Sample Output 2: 5
