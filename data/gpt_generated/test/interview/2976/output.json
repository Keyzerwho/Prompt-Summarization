The following rules apply: - A player wins a set if he has $6$ or more games and at least two games more than his opponent. - Additionally, if the result is $6:6$ in the first or second set (but not the third set), a single final game is played to determine the winner of the set (the tie-break game). - The match ends when either player has won 2 sets. That player is the winner. A match result is valid if a match could have been played by the above rules and ended in the result. Additionally, if one of the players is Roger Federer (designated as federer in the input), then a result in which he has lost a set can t be valid (Zvonko knows Federer is from outer space). Write a program that checks the validity of all matches between two players.",
