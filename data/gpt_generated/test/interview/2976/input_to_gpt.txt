The USA Construction Operation (USACO) recently ordered Farmer John to arrange a row of $n$ haybale piles on the farm. The $i$-th pile contains $a_i$ haybales.  However, Farmer John has just left for vacation, leaving Bessie all on her own. Every day, Bessie the naughty cow can choose to move one haybale in any pile to an adjacent pile. Formally, in one day she can choose any two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$) such that $|i-j|=1$ and $a_i>0$ and apply $a_i = a_i - 1$, $a_j = a_j + 1$. She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy. Bessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile $1$ (i.e. to maximize $a_1$), and she only has $d$ days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile $1$ if she acts optimally! 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 

You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.

You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of $n\cdot m$ identical pieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. $\{3$  The jigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold:  The pieces are arranged into a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns.  For any two pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly into a blank of the other piece.  Through rotation and translation of the pieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle.

After Borko s second plan of taking over the village fell through (because Mirko s brother Stanko drank all the water), young Zvonko decided to relax with sports. For this purpose he stocked up on carrot juice and peanuts, and dived onto the couch, ready to watch the next tennis match on television. While the two players are warming up, their statistics pop up on the screen. Zvonko noticed that the match history of the players contained invalid results. He had a brilliant idea where you write him a program that checks the validity of results, which he will then sell to the record keepers and enjoy a leisurely life. A tennis match consists of sets, each set consisting of games. The following rules apply:  - A player wins a set if he has $6$ or more games and at least two games more than his opponent.  - Additionally, if the result is $6:6$ in the first or second set (but not the third set), a single final game is played to determine the winner of the set (the tie-break game).  - The match ends when either player has won 2 sets. That player is the winner. A match result is valid if a match could have been played by the above rules and ended in the result. Additionally, if one of the players is Roger Federer (designated as  federer  in the input), then a result in which he has lost a set can t be valid (Zvonko knows Federer is from outer space). Write a program that checks the validity of all matches between two players.
