You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}]. Define its prefix product sequence $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 
tl;dr: Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}].  Let's define its prefix product sequence as $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 

Theta has been learning about powers of $2$ in school. She notices that some numbers when written out contain powers of $2$ in their digit representation: for instance, $12560$ contains $256$ which is a power of $2$. She has been wondering how many such numbers there are. Can you write a program that counts how many numbers contain a given power of $2$
