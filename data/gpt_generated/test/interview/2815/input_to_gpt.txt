There are N bags, each containing two white balls. The i-th box contains two balls with integers x_i and y_i written on them, respectively. For each of these bags, you will paint one of the balls red, and paint the other blue. Afterwards, the 2N balls will be classified according to color. Then, we will define the following:  - R_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in red  - R_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in red  - B_{max}: the maximum integer written on a ball painted in blue  - B_{min}: the minimum integer written on a ball painted in blue Find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) \times (B_{max} - B_{min}). -----Constraints-----  - 1   N   200,000  - 1   x_i, y_i   10^9

# Task Elections are in progress! Given an array of numbers representing votes given to each of the candidates, and an integer which is equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election. The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all. **Note**: big arrays will be tested. #

Little X has n distinct integers: p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}. He wants to divide all of them into two sets A and B. The following two conditions must be satisfied:  If number x belongs to set A, then number a - x must also belong to set A.  If number x belongs to set B, then number b - x must also belong to set B.  Help Little X divide the numbers into two sets or determine that it's impossible.

Theta has been learning about powers of $2$ in school. She notices that some numbers when written out contain powers of $2$ in their digit representation: for instance, $12560$ contains $256$ which is a power of $2$. She has been wondering how many such numbers there are. Can you write a program that counts how many numbers contain a given power of $2$
