You are given an array $a_1, a_2 \dots a_n$. Calculate the number of tuples $(i, j, k, l)$ such that:   $1 \le i < j < k < l \le n$;  $a_i = a_k$ and $a_j = a_l$;

A subsequence of a string S is a string that can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from S without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, arc, artistic and (an empty string) are all subsequences of artistic; abc and ci are not. You are given a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Find the shortest string among the strings consisting of lowercase English letters that are not subsequences of A. If there are more than one such string, find the lexicographically smallest one among them. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |A| \leq 2 \times 10^5  - A consists of lowercase English letters.

Morse Code is an assignment of sequences of dots and dashes to alphabet characters. You are to create a Morse-like code that yields the shortest total length to a given message, and return that total length. A dot symbol has length $1$. A dash symbol has length $3$. The gap between symbols within a character encoding has length $1$. The gap between character encodings has length $3$. Spaces, punctuation, and alphabetic case are ignored, so the text:The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox. is encoded as though it were justTHEQUICKBROWNDOGJUMPSOVERTHELAZYFOX For example, with input ICPC, the answer is $17$: Encode the C s with a single dot, the I with a dash, and the P with two dots, for an encoding of  $\bullet $ $\bullet \bullet $ $\bullet $ which has length$(3)+3+(1)+3+(1+1+1)+3+(1) = 17$.
