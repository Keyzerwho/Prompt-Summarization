            "text": " You are broke. A generous gazillionaire friend has offered to lend you an arbitrary amount of money (as much as you need), without interest, to invest in the stock market. After making some profit you will then return the original sum to your friend, leaving you with the remainder. You can only invest once in each investment opportunity, but you can invest in as many different investment opportunities as you like. For example, consider the first sample. If you buy only the second investment (which costs $15$ euros) you will earn $p_2 = 10$ euros per day. After two days you will have earned $20$ euros, exactly enough to pay off your friend (from whom you borrowed $15$ euros) and retire with the remaining profit ($5$ euros). There is no way to make a net amount of $5$ euros in a single day, so two days is the fastest possible.",
