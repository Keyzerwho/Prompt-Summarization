# Task  CodeBots decided to make a gift for CodeMaster's birthday. They got a pack of candies of various sizes from the store, but instead of giving the whole pack they are trying to make the biggest possible candy from them. On each turn it is possible:    ```  to pick any two candies of the same size and merge  them into a candy which will be two times bigger;  to pick a single candy of an even size and split it   into two equal candies half of this size each.``` What is the size of the biggest candy they can make as a gift  #

Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

Being a responsible young adult, you have decided to start planning for retirement. Doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations, you figured out you need at least $M$ euros to retire comfortably. You are currently broke, but fortunately a generous gazillionaire friend has offered to lend you an arbitrary amount of money (as much as you need), without interest, to invest in the stock market. After making some profit you will then return the original sum to your friend, leaving you with the remainder. Available to you are $n$ investment opportunities, the $i$-th of which costs $c_ i$ euros. You also used your computer science skills to predict that the $i$-th investment will earn you $p_ i$ euros per day. What is the minimum number of days you need before you can pay back your friend and retire  You can only invest once in each investment opportunity, but you can invest in as many different investment opportunities as you like. For example, consider the first sample. If you buy only the second investment (which costs $15$ euros) you will earn $p_2 = 10$ euros per day. After two days you will have earned $20$ euros, exactly enough to pay off your friend (from whom you borrowed $15$ euros) and retire with the remaining profit ($5$ euros). There is no way to make a net amount of $5$ euros in a single day, so two days is the fastest possible.
