You have initially a string of N characters, denoted by A1,A2...AN. You have to print the size of the largest subsequence of string A such that all the characters in that subsequence are distinct ie. no two characters in that subsequence should be same. A subsequence of string A is a sequence that can be derived from A by deleting some elements  and without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
tl;dr: You have to remove duplicates and print the length of unique characters of the given string. 

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls $x = 0$). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices $0 \leq i < m$, such that $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \right\rfloor$ is odd. Tell her the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$.

Damir likes to rotate. Right now he is rotating tables of letters. He wrote an $R\times C$ table onto a piece of paper. He has also chosen an angle $K$, a multiple of $45$, and wants to rotate his table that many degrees clockwise. It turns out this task is a bit too hard for Damir, so help him out.
