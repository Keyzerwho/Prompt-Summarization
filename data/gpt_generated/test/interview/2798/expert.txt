 You need to write a program that takes in a state of a game (a cuboid with three planes) and outputs who would win if both players played optimally. 
-----Input----- The first line of input is a line containing either RUBEN or ALBERT, the name of the player who starts that particular round.  Then follows a line containing $N$, the number of cuboids that particular game starts with. $N$ lines follow, each describing a cuboid. A cuboid description consists of three numbers, $x$, $y$ and $z$, the size of that particular cuboid. -----Output----- Output the name of the player that wins the game (either RUBEN or ALBERT). -----Limits-----  - $1 \le N \le 100$  - $1 \le x,y,z \le 30$ -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: RUBEN 1 4 1 7 Sample Output 1: RUBEN Sample Input 2: ALBERT 2 4 4 4 2 2 2 Sample Output 2: RUBEN
