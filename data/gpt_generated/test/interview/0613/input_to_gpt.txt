You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening  Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages. These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before: * hello - english * ciao - italian * salut - french * hallo - german * hola - spanish * ahoj - czech republic * czesc - polish By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!! PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test) PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the test
tl;dr: Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hello in different languages. Regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine whether we can turn S into a palindrome by repeating the operation of swapping two adjacent characters. If it is possible, find the minimum required number of operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |S| \leq 2   10^5  - S consists of lowercase English letters.

You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Vasya is studying in the last class of school and soon he will take exams. He decided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function P(x) = a_0 + a_1x^1 + ... + a_{n}x^{n}. Numbers a_{i} are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative integer n is called a degree of a polynomial. Vasya has made a bet with his friends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the problem: "Determine how many polynomials P(x) exist with integer non-negative coefficients so that $P(t) = a$, and $P(P(t)) = b$, where $t, a$ and b are given positive integers"   Vasya does not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so please help him to solve the problem.
