Dreamoon likes coloring cells very much. There is a row of $n$ cells. Initially, all cells are empty (don't contain any color). Cells are numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are given an integer $m$ and $m$ integers $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_m$ ($1 \le l_i \le n$) Dreamoon will perform $m$ operations. In $i$-th operation, Dreamoon will choose a number $p_i$ from range $[1, n-l_i+1]$ (inclusive) and will paint all cells from $p_i$ to $p_i+l_i-1$ (inclusive) in $i$-th color. Note that cells may be colored more one than once, in this case, cell will have the color from the latest operation. Dreamoon hopes that after these $m$ operations, all colors will appear at least once and all cells will be colored. Please help Dreamoon to choose $p_i$ in each operation to satisfy all constraints.

Chef has a natural number N. Cheffina challenges chef to check whether the given number is divisible by the sum of its digits or not. If the given number is divisible then print "Yes" else "No".

You are locked in a room with a door that has a keypad with 10 keys corresponding to digits from 0 to 9. To escape from the room, you need to enter a correct code. You also have a sequence of digits. Some keys on the keypad have fingerprints. You believe the correct code is the longest not necessarily contiguous subsequence of the sequence you have that only contains digits with fingerprints on the corresponding keys. Find such code.
