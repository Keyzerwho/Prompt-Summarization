Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division. To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with $t$ pairs of integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer $x_i$, such that:   $p_i$ is divisible by $x_i$;  $x_i$ is not divisible by $q_i$.  Oleg is really good at division and managed to find all the answers quickly, how about you

Is every value in the array an array  This should only test the second array dimension of the array. The values of the nested arrays don't have to be arrays.

Mirko has received a homework assignment to compute the greatest common divisor of the two positive integers $A$ and $B$. Since the numbers are quite large, the teacher provided him with $N$ smaller integers whose product is $A$, and $M$ integers with product $B$. Mirko would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more than $9$ digits long, output only the last $9$ digits.
