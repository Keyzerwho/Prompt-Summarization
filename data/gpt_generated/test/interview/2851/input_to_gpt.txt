Given a string S. You have to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of S are grouped and groups are space-separated (see sample below) 
tl;dr: Given a string S, you have to return another string such that even-indexed and odd-indexed characters of S are grouped and groups are space-separated. 

You are given a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.  Determine a real number x such that the weakness of the sequence a_1 - x, a_2 - x, ..., a_{n} - x is as small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum value of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a sequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of the elements of segment.

# Story You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee. Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on... But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work. To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in. # Kata Task Given the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted. # 
tl;dr: # Task Given the start and end numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all digits from start number to end number. # 

Mirko has received a homework assignment to compute the greatest common divisor of the two positive integers $A$ and $B$. Since the numbers are quite large, the teacher provided him with $N$ smaller integers whose product is $A$, and $M$ integers with product $B$. Mirko would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more than $9$ digits long, output only the last $9$ digits.
