Since the numbers are quite large, the teacher provided him with $N$ smaller integers whose product is $A$, and $M$ integers with product $B$. Mirko would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more than $9$ digits long, output only the last $9$ digits. ",
