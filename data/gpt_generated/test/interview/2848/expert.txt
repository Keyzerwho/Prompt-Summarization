 You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 
-----Input----- Input consists of the space-separated integers $1 \le N \le 10^6$, $1 \le R \le 10^7$, $1 \le K \le 10$, $0 \le X_0, A, B \le 2^{31} - 1$. -----Output----- If the leftmost bucket overflows, output “OVERFLOW”. Otherwise, the output should be calculated as follows: Let $O_ i$ be the bucket which the $i$:th rain drop ended up in, and let $a = 0$. Then, for every $i$ from $1$ to $R$, set $a := (53 \cdot a + O_ i) \mod 199933$. The output should then be a line with the integer $a$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 6 1 2 1 8 Sample Output 1: OVERFLOW Sample Input 2: 10 6 1 4 1 8 Sample Output 2: 79732
