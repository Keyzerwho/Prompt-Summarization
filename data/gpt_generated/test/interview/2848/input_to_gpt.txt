We have a permutation of the integers from 1 through N, p_1, p_2, .., p_N. We also have M pairs of two integers between 1 and N (inclusive), represented as (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), .., (x_M,y_M). AtCoDeer the deer is going to perform the following operation on p as many times as desired so that the number of i (1   i   N) such that p_i = i is maximized:  - Choose j such that 1   j   M, and swap p_{x_j} and p_{y_j}. Find the maximum possible number of i such that p_i = i after operations. -----Constraints-----  - 2   N   10^5  - 1   M   10^5  - p is a permutation of integers from 1 through N.  - 1   x_j,y_j   N  - x_j   y_j  - If i   j, \{x_i,y_i\}   \{x_j,y_j\}.  - All values in input are integers.

You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges. You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct all undirected edges. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 

There is a heavy rainfall over the Antique Cultural Museum, and the roof has sprung a leak! All the beautiful paintings risk destruction, if it weren t for one brave night watchman standing in the water s way   Klunkas Plaskocek. To protect all of the paintings, Klunkas has brought $N$ buckets and placed them in a long row to catch the water falling from the ceiling. Each bucket can hold exactly $K$ drops of water. If a drop falls into a bucket which is full, the water drop will overflow to the bucket standing to the left. If that bucket is full as well, the drop will keep flowing left until there is a non-full bucket. Klunkas needs your help to prevent the leftmost bucket overflowing. After every drop of water falls, Klunkas wants to know which bucket it ended up in, so that he can keep track of the water levels of the buckets. Due to the very regular nature of rain, Klunkas figured that the $R$ rain drops fall in a very nice pattern. Given constants $X_0, A, B$, we define the sequence $X_ i$ as\[ X_ i = (A \cdot X_{i-1} + B) \mod N \] The bucket which the $i$-th rain drop falls into, is then $X_ i$ for $i = 1, \dots , R$. The leftmost bucket has the number $0$, and the rightmost bucket has the number $N-1$.
