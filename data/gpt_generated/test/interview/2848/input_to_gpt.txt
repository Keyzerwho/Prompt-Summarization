Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. $1$ represents an apple and $0$ represents an orange. Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest contiguous sequence of apples. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of apples in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$.  Help Zookeeper find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$, or the sum of $f$ across all substrings. 
tl;dr: Given a sequence, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of $1$ in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$.  Find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$. 

Baby is getting his frst tooth. This means more sleepless nights, but with the fun of feeling round his gums and trying to guess which will be first out!  Probably best have a sweepstake with your friends - because you have the best chance of knowing. You can feel the gums and see where the raised bits are - most raised, most likely tooth to come through first! Given an array of numbers (t) to represent baby's gums, you need to return the index of the lump that is most pronounced.  The most pronounced lump is the one that has the biggest differential to its surrounding values. e.g.: ``` [1, 2, 4] = 2 index 0 has a differential of -1 to its right (it is lower so the figure is negative) index 1 has a differential of +1 to its left, and -2 to its right. Total is -1. index 2 has a differential of +2 to its left, and nothing to its right,  ``` If there is no distinct highest value (more than one occurence of the largest differential), return -1

Write a function called that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return `true` if the string is valid, and `false` if it's invalid. ##

There is a heavy rainfall over the Antique Cultural Museum, and the roof has sprung a leak! All the beautiful paintings risk destruction, if it weren t for one brave night watchman standing in the water s way   Klunkas Plaskocek. To protect all of the paintings, Klunkas has brought $N$ buckets and placed them in a long row to catch the water falling from the ceiling. Each bucket can hold exactly $K$ drops of water. If a drop falls into a bucket which is full, the water drop will overflow to the bucket standing to the left. If that bucket is full as well, the drop will keep flowing left until there is a non-full bucket. Klunkas needs your help to prevent the leftmost bucket overflowing. After every drop of water falls, Klunkas wants to know which bucket it ended up in, so that he can keep track of the water levels of the buckets. Due to the very regular nature of rain, Klunkas figured that the $R$ rain drops fall in a very nice pattern. Given constants $X_0, A, B$, we define the sequence $X_ i$ as\[ X_ i = (A \cdot X_{i-1} + B) \mod N \] The bucket which the $i$-th rain drop falls into, is then $X_ i$ for $i = 1, \dots , R$. The leftmost bucket has the number $0$, and the rightmost bucket has the number $N-1$.
