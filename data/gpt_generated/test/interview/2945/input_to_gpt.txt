This is a peculiar functioning setup. Two Tanks are separated from each other by a wall .There is a pipe in the wall which connects  both tanks  which allows flow of water between them . Due to this ,there is change in temperature of both tanks , every minute temperature of Tank with larger temperature among two decreases by one and temperature of Tank  with smaller temperature among two increases by two until equilibrium is reached , But there is a problem . The pipe can't control this flow of water if there is Non-equilibrium (inequality of temperature  on  both sides )  even after $m$ minutes and the pipe will burst after it , your task is to predict whether the pipe will burst or not . 
tl;dr: Given numbers $m$, $Tc$, $Th$.  If the difference between $Tc$ and $Th$ is not divisible by $3$, return "Yes". Else if the differnce divided by $3$ is more than $m$ return "Yes".  Else return "No". 

You are given a sequence of $n$ digits $d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}$. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:  each digit is painted either in the color $1$ or in the color $2$;  if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $1$, and then after them all the digits painted in the color $2$, then the resulting sequence of $n$ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).  For example, for the sequence $d=914$ the only valid coloring is $211$ (paint in the color $1$ two last digits, paint in the color $2$ the first digit). But $122$ is not a valid coloring ($9$ concatenated with $14$ is not a non-decreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

The chef won a duet singing award at Techsurge & Mridang 2012. From that time he is obsessed with the number 2. He just started calculating the powers of two. And adding the digits of the results. But he got puzzled after a few calculations. So gave you the job to generate the solutions to 2^n and find their sum of digits. 
tl;dr: Obtain the solutions to 2^n for a given n and display their sum of digits. 

The local zoo has acquired a large open garden in which animals may freely move as in their natural habitats and entertain visitors with their usual shenanigans. The most popular animals are monkeys. With their climbing and jumping and other skills, they delight old and young visitors alike. One species of monkey has specialized in climbing tall trees and picking off coconuts. Another species has specialized in breaking them open. There are $N$ monkeys of the first type (numbered 1 through $N$) and $M$ monkeys of the second type (numbered 1 through $M$). Monkey $k$ of the first type takes $A_ k$ seconds to find a good spot on the tree, after which it picks off its first coconut. After that the monkey produces a new coconut every $B_ k$ seconds. Monkey $k$ of the second type takes $C_ k$ seconds to find a good tool for opening the coconuts, after which it opens its first coconut. After that the monkey opens another coconut every $D_ k$ seconds. Unfortunately, the second type of monkey is extremely aggressive so the two types may not be in the garden at the same time. Therefore, zoo keepers will chase away the first type of monkeys as soon as they have picked off all the coconuts. Similarly, if monkeys of the same type stay too long after opening all the coconuts, fights will ensue. Because of that, zoo keepers will send them away as soon as they have opened all the coconuts. The zoo keepers first arrive immediately after all coconuts have been picked, and again immediately after the monkeys open them all. The time needed for monkeys to enter or leave the garden is also negligibly small. Tomislav especially likes the second type of monkey, but can never guess when to arrive in order to see them. Help him calculate the time when the second type arrives if he knows the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, but does not know the number of coconuts in the garden.
