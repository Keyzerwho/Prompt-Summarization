 You are given the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, but do not know the number of coconuts in the garden. Help Tomislav calculate the time when the second type of monkey arrives if he knows the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, but does not know the number of coconuts in the garden. 
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer $T$ $(1 \leq T \leq 1000000000)$, the total time that monkeys spent in the garden, in seconds. The next line contains the integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 100)$, the number of monkeys of the first type. Each of the following $N$ lines contains two integers $A_ k$ and $B_ k$ $(1 \leq A_ k, B_ k \leq 1000000000)$, how fast monkey $k$ of the first type is. The next line contains the integer $M$ $(1 \leq M \leq 100)$, the number of monkeys of the second type. Each of the following $M$ lines contains two integers $C_ k$ and $D_ k$ $(1 \leq C_ k, D_ k \leq 1000000000)$, how fast monkey $k$ of the second type is. -----Output----- Output the number of seconds between the arrival of the first type of monkeys and the arrival of the second type. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 12 1 3 1 1 5 1 Sample Output: 5
