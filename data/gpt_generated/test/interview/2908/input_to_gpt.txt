You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.  The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side.  Each steel support must be an equal height. You have a collection of rods which can be welded together.  For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6. Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation.  If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.   
tl;dr: You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   

Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the size n   m meters.

tl;dr: Given n, m and a, calculate the number of squares of side length a required to completely cover a rectangle of length m and breadth n. Input The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1    n, m, a   10^9). Output Print the needed squares. 

Simon is a contestant on the new exciting game show, Add  Em Up! In this show, contestants are given a set of cards with multi-digit numbers on them, and need to select two cards that add up to a given sum. However, to make things more interesting, the font that the cards are printed in (see below) means that certain cards will display different numbers if turned upside-down, and it is legal to turn either or both of the cards if necessary to generate the sum.
