Tavak and Seyyed are good friends. Seyyed is very funny and he told Tavak to solve the following problem instead of longest-path. You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem.

Heidi is a statistician to the core, and she likes to study the evolution of marmot populations in each of V (1   V   100) villages! So it comes that every spring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her barn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome her friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures. Arriving in a village, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of inhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April Fools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of inhabitants P (10   P   1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-negative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:   Poisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{p^{k} e^{-P}}{k !}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,  Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is $\frac{1}{2 P + 1}$ for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P.  Heidi collects exactly 250 answers per village. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution. Heidi cannot tell marmots apart, so she may query some marmots several times, and each time the marmot will answer with a new number drawn from the village's distribution. Can you help Heidi to find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  
tl;dr: The input given are two series of non-negative integers following Poisson or a uniform distribution.    You need to output whether the series follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution  

Simon is a contestant on the new exciting game show, Add  Em Up! In this show, contestants are given a set of cards with multi-digit numbers on them, and need to select two cards that add up to a given sum. However, to make things more interesting, the font that the cards are printed in (see below) means that certain cards will display different numbers if turned upside-down, and it is legal to turn either or both of the cards if necessary to generate the sum. Please help Simon win the game!
