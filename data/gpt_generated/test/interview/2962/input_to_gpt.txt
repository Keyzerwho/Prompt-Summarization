You are given a sequence a = \{a_1, ..., a_N\} with all zeros, and a sequence b = \{b_1, ..., b_N\} consisting of 0 and 1. The length of both is N. You can perform Q kinds of operations. The i-th operation is as follows:  - Replace each of a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, ..., a_{r_i} with 1. Minimize the hamming distance between a and b, that is, the number of i such that a_i \neq b_i, by performing some of the Q operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 200,000  - b consists of 0 and 1.  - 1 \leq Q \leq 200,000  - 1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq N  - If i \neq j, either l_i \neq l_j or r_i \neq r_j.

# Task Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence. Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.  ## Input * sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.  For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`)

Simple transposition is a basic and simple cryptography technique. We make 2 rows and put first a letter in the Row 1, the second in the Row 2, third in Row 1 and so on until the end. Then we put the text from Row 2 next to the Row 1 text and thats it. Complete the function that receives a string and encrypt it with this simple transposition. ##

Oliver is a manager of a bank near KTH and wants to close soon. There are many people standing in the queue wanting to put cash into their accounts after they heard that the bank increased the interest rates by $42\% $ (from $0.01\% $ per year to $0.0142\% $ per year).  However, there are too many people and only one counter is open which can serve one person per minute. Greedy as Oliver is, he would like to select some people in the queue, so that the total amount of cash stored by these people is as big as possible and that money then can work for the bank overnight. There is a problem, though. Some people don t have the time to wait until the bank closes because they have to run somewhere else, so they have to be served before a certain time, after which they just leave. Oliver also turned off the infrared door sensor outside the bank, so that no more people can enter, because it s already too crowded in the hall. -----Task----- Help Oliver calculate how much cash he can get from the people currently standing in the queue before the bank closes by serving at most one person per minute.
