As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards. He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number $k$, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases $j$, $2 \\leq j \\leq k$, in that range. ",
