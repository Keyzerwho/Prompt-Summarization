Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

There are $n$ lamps on a line, numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each one has an initial state off ($0$) or on ($1$). You're given $k$ subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$, such that the intersection of any three subsets is empty. In other words, for all $1 \le i_1 < i_2 < i_3 \le k$, $A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap A_{i_3} = \varnothing$. In one operation, you can choose one of these $k$ subsets and switch the state of all lamps in it. It is guaranteed that, with the given subsets, it's possible to make all lamps be simultaneously on using this type of operation. Let $m_i$ be the minimum number of operations you have to do in order to make the $i$ first lamps be simultaneously on. Note that there is no condition upon the state of other lamps (between $i+1$ and $n$), they can be either off or on. You have to compute $m_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$.

Nicholas Neverson was a student at Northlings Neverland Academy. As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards. He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number $k$, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases $j$, $2 \leq j \leq k$, in that range.
