You are given integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied: For every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $2n$ numbers differ not more than by $1$. For example, choose $n = 3$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, $4 + 5 + 2 = 11$, $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$, $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$, $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$, $6 + 1 + 4 = 11$, any two numbers differ by at most $1$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $5 + 1 + 6 = 12$, and $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$, $9$ and $12$ differ more than by $1$.  [Image]

Given that  ``` f0 = '0' f1 = '01' f2 = '010' = f1 + f0 f3 = '01001' = f2 + f1 ``` You will be given a number and your task is to return the `nth` fibonacci string. For example: ``` solve(2) = '010' solve(3) = '01001' ``` More examples in test cases. Good luck!

In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible. The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Nicholas Neverson was a student at Northlings Neverland Academy. As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is any number which reads the same forwards and backwards. He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a program that given a range and a number $k$, outputs the number of numbers palindromic in all bases $j$, $2 \leq j \leq k$, in that range.
