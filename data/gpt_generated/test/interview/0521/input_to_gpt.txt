Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 3. If any of the permutations is divisible by 3 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: Check whether the given number N is divisible by 3 or not. If yes then print 1 else print 0. 

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.  The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side.  Each steel support must be an equal height. You have a collection of rods which can be welded together.  For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6. Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation.  If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.   
tl;dr: You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6. Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.   

Overlooking the captivating blend of myriads of vernal hues, Arkady the painter lays out a long, long canvas. Arkady has a sufficiently large amount of paint of three colours: cyan, magenta, and yellow. On the one-dimensional canvas split into n consecutive segments, each segment needs to be painted in one of the colours. Arkady has already painted some (possibly none or all) segments and passes the paintbrush to you. You are to determine whether there are at least two ways of colouring all the unpainted segments so that no two adjacent segments are of the same colour. Two ways are considered different if and only if a segment is painted in different colours in them.
