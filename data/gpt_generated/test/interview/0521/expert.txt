 You are given a one-dimensional array of integers. You need to paint the array in such a way that no two adjacent elements are painted in the same colour. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the canvas. The second line contains a string s of n characters, the i-th of which is either 'C' (denoting a segment painted in cyan), 'M' (denoting one painted in magenta), 'Y' (one painted in yellow), or '?' (an unpainted one). -----Output----- If there are at least two different ways of painting, output "Yes"; otherwise output "No" (both without quotes). You can print each character in any case (upper or lower). -----Examples----- Input 5 CY??Y Output Yes Input 5 C?C?Y Output Yes Input 5 ?CYC? Output Yes Input 5 C??MM Output No Input 3 MMY Output No -----Note----- For the first example, there are exactly two different ways of colouring: CYCMY and CYMCY. For the second example, there are also exactly two different ways of colouring: CMCMY and CYCMY. For the third example, there are four ways of colouring: MCYCM, MCYCY, YCYCM, and YCYCY. For the fourth example, no matter how the unpainted segments are coloured, the existing magenta segments will prevent the painting from satisfying the requirements. The similar is true for the fifth example.
