Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable x and its coefficient. If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution". If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions". If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of x is an integer. 
tl;dr: Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". For the equation, if there is no solution, return "No solution" or if infinite solutions, return "Infinite solutions" or if exactly one solution for the equation, ensure that the value of x is an integer. 

-----General Statement:----- Given the actual high and low temperatures for the day and the normal high and low temperatures for that day, calculate the average difference from normal. 
tl;dr: Determine the average of the difference of the high temperatures and the difference of the low temperatures. 

The magic sum of 3s is calculated on an array by summing up odd numbers which include the digit `3`. Write a function `magic_sum` which accepts an array of integers and returns the sum. *
tl;dr: The magic sum of 3s is calculated on an array by summing up odd numbers which include the digit 3. Write a function magic_sum which accepts an array of integers and returns the sum. If the sum cannot be calculated, 0 should be returned. 

Last winter, an avalanche swept away all the ski lifts from the ski resort Valen. Instead of rebuilding the lifts like they were before, the plan is to do it in a more optimized way, and you are responsible for this.  The only thing remaining from the old lift system are $n$ pylons situated at integer coordinates in the plane. You would like to put lifts in the form of line segments between some of these pylons. The line segments must satisfy the following constraints:  - A line segment can only go between pylons $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ if $|y_1-y_2| = 1$.  - There are two types of pylons, one-way and two-way pylons. The one-way pylons can be connected to at most one other pylon, and the two-way pylons can be connected to at most two other pylons. However, if a two-way pylon $i$ is connected to two other pylons, then they must be on opposite sides of $i$ in the $y$-direction. In other words, the two pylons connected to $i$ must have different $y$-coordinates.  - Two line segments may not intersect (except that the two line segments incident on a two-way pylon may touch at their endpoints). What is the maximum number of ski lifts (line segments) you can place under these constraints
