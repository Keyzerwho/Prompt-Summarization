Igor the analyst has adopted n little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. Igor wants to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. He wants to make sure that all n pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area   [Image] Illustration to the first example.  
tl;dr: You have n bunnies. You have bought a carrot to be shared between these bunnies. You want to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus want to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. You want to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. Make sure that all n pieces have the same area. 

You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string. Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve. 
tl;dr: You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters.You have to replace a one character by other character present in the string so that the string becomes lexicographically smallest.Find that lexicographically smallest  string. 

Last winter, an avalanche swept away all the ski lifts from the ski resort Valen. Instead of rebuilding the lifts like they were before, the plan is to do it in a more optimized way, and you are responsible for this.  The only thing remaining from the old lift system are $n$ pylons situated at integer coordinates in the plane. You would like to put lifts in the form of line segments between some of these pylons. The line segments must satisfy the following constraints:  - A line segment can only go between pylons $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ if $|y_1-y_2| = 1$.  - There are two types of pylons, one-way and two-way pylons. The one-way pylons can be connected to at most one other pylon, and the two-way pylons can be connected to at most two other pylons. However, if a two-way pylon $i$ is connected to two other pylons, then they must be on opposite sides of $i$ in the $y$-direction. In other words, the two pylons connected to $i$ must have different $y$-coordinates.  - Two line segments may not intersect (except that the two line segments incident on a two-way pylon may touch at their endpoints). What is the maximum number of ski lifts (line segments) you can place under these constraints
