Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"] i.e.

The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv has an array A that consists of N positive integers. Let A[i] be the i-th number in this array (i = 1, 2, ..., N). Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A. More formally, this x should satisfy the following relations: A[1] mod x = 0, A[2] mod x = 0, ..., A[N] mod x = 0, where mod stands for the modulo operation. For example,  8 mod 3 = 2,  2 mod 2 = 0, 100 mod 5 = 0 and so on. If such number does not exist, output -1. 
tl;dr: You are given an array A that consists of N positive integers. Find the minimal number x > 1 such that x is a divisor of all integers from array A.  If such number does not exist, output -1. 

Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i]. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties. Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins. Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.   
tl;dr: Alex and Lee play a game with a list of numbers. There are an even number of elements in the list and each value has a positive integer number. The objective of the game is to end with largest value. The total sum of values is odd, so there are no ties. Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first. Each turn, a player takes value from either the beginning or the end of the list. This continues until there are no more values left, at which point the person with the largest value wins. Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game. 

When ninjas go to conferences they wear fake nametags. One ninja in particular wants to impress his Sensei. His Sensei chooses a new favorite number every day. The pupil wants to put a name on his nametag that encodes his Sensei s favorite number! This name will consist of only lower case letters. He assigns a value to each letter, based on its position in the alphabet (e.g. $\texttt{a}=1$, $\texttt{b}=2$, ..., $\texttt{z}=26$). Then, he encodes the Sensei s number by adding up the absolute values of the differences of every consecutive pair of letters. For example, the string $\texttt{azxb}$ has the value of:\[ |\texttt{a} - \texttt{z}| + |\texttt{z} - \texttt{x}| + |\texttt{x} - \texttt{b}| = |1 - 26| + |26 - 24| + |24 - 2| = 49 \] The name that the ninja will write on his nametag is the shortest string that encodes to his Sensei s favorite number. If there s more than one string of the shortest length, he ll choose the one that comes first alphabetically. Given the Sensei s favorite number, $k$, find the string that the ninja should put on his nametag.
