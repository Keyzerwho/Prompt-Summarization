# Story Due to lack of maintenance the minute-hand has fallen off Town Hall clock face. And because the local council has lost most of our tax money to a Nigerian email scam there are no funds to fix the clock properly.  Instead, they are asking for volunteer programmers to write some code that tell the time by only looking at the remaining hour-hand! What a bunch of cheapskates! Can you do it  # Kata Given the ```angle``` (in degrees) of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format. Round _down_ to the nearest minute. # 
tl;dr: Given the angle of the hour-hand, return the time in HH:MM format and round down to the nearest minute. 0 <= angle <= 360 #

When ninjas go to conferences they wear fake nametags. One ninja in particular wants to impress his Sensei. His Sensei chooses a new favorite number every day. The pupil wants to put a name on his nametag that encodes his Sensei s favorite number! This name will consist of only lower case letters. He assigns a value to each letter, based on its position in the alphabet (e.g. $\texttt{a}=1$, $\texttt{b}=2$, ..., $\texttt{z}=26$). Then, he encodes the Sensei s number by adding up the absolute values of the differences of every consecutive pair of letters. For example, the string $\texttt{azxb}$ has the value of:\[ |\texttt{a} - \texttt{z}| + |\texttt{z} - \texttt{x}| + |\texttt{x} - \texttt{b}| = |1 - 26| + |26 - 24| + |24 - 2| = 49 \] The name that the ninja will write on his nametag is the shortest string that encodes to his Sensei s favorite number. If there s more than one string of the shortest length, he ll choose the one that comes first alphabetically. Given the Sensei s favorite number, $k$, find the string that the ninja should put on his nametag.
