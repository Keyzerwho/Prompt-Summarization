Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (x_{i}, y_{i}). They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|. Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula $\sqrt{(x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} +(y_{i} - y_{j})^{2}}$. The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i, j) (1   i < j   n), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

The 3rd round of COCI is already here! In order to bet on predict the scores, we have assumed the following:  - If contestant $A$ scored strictly more points than contestant $B$ in each of the first two rounds, then in the third round $A$ will score at least an equal amount of points as $B$. Of course, in each round (including this one, the 3rd one) it is possible to score from 0 to 650 points. On the total ranking list, contestants are sorted descending according to the sum of points from all three rounds. The contestants with an equal sum share the same place and the next contestant gets the realistic following place. For example, contestants with sums equal to 1000, 1000, 900, 900 and 800 points win places 1, 1, 3, 3 and 5, respectively. For each of the $N$ contestants, we know the number of points scored in the first and second round. Given the aforementioned assumption, determine the highest and lowest place each contestant can get on the total ranking list after three rounds of COCI.
