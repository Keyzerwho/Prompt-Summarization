For an array $b$ of length $m$ we define the function $f$ as  $ f(b) = \begin{cases} b[1] & \quad \text{if } m = 1 \\ f(b[1] \oplus b[2],b[2] \oplus b[3],\dots,b[m-1] \oplus b[m]) & \quad \text{otherwise,} \end{cases} $  where $\oplus$ is bitwise exclusive OR. For example, $f(1,2,4,8)=f(1\oplus2,2\oplus4,4\oplus8)=f(3,6,12)=f(3\oplus6,6\oplus12)=f(5,10)=f(5\oplus10)=f(15)=15$ You are given an array $a$ and a few queries. Each query is represented as two integers $l$ and $r$. The answer is the maximum value of $f$ on all continuous subsegments of the array $a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$.

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones. Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap. 
tl;dr: For a given stone heap, you and your friend can remove 1 to 3 stones in one step.You have to take first and the one who removes the last stone will be the winner.Determine whether you are the winner or not. 

Given a string s, write a method (function) that will return true if its a valid single integer or floating number or false if its not. Valid examples, should return true: should return false
tl;dr: Given a string s, write a method that will return true if it is a valid single integer or floating number or false if it is not

The 3rd round of COCI is already here! In order to bet on predict the scores, we have assumed the following:  - If contestant $A$ scored strictly more points than contestant $B$ in each of the first two rounds, then in the third round $A$ will score at least an equal amount of points as $B$. Of course, in each round (including this one, the 3rd one) it is possible to score from 0 to 650 points. On the total ranking list, contestants are sorted descending according to the sum of points from all three rounds. The contestants with an equal sum share the same place and the next contestant gets the realistic following place. For example, contestants with sums equal to 1000, 1000, 900, 900 and 800 points win places 1, 1, 3, 3 and 5, respectively. For each of the $N$ contestants, we know the number of points scored in the first and second round. Given the aforementioned assumption, determine the highest and lowest place each contestant can get on the total ranking list after three rounds of COCI.
