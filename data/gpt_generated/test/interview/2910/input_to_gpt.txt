Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable x and its coefficient. If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution". If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions". If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of x is an integer. 
tl;dr: Solve a given equation and return the value of x in the form of string "x=#value". For the equation, if there is no solution, return "No solution" or if infinite solutions, return "Infinite solutions" or if exactly one solution for the equation, ensure that the value of x is an integer. 

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships. 
tl;dr: Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 

Iskander the Baker is decorating a huge cake, covering the rectangular surface of the cake with frosting. For this purpose, he mixes frosting sugar with lemon juice and food coloring, in order to produce three kinds of frosting: yellow, pink, and white. These colors are identified by the numbers $0$ for yellow, $1$ for pink, and $2$ for white. To obtain a nice pattern, he partitions the cake surface into vertical stripes of width $A_1, A_2, \dots , A_ n$ centimeters, and horizontal stripes of height $B_1, B_2, \dots , B_ n$ centimeters, for some positive integer $n$. These stripes split the cake surface into $n\times n$ rectangles. The intersection of vertical stripe $i$ and horizontal stripe $j$ has color number $(i+j) \bmod 3$ for all $1 \leq i,j \leq n$. To prepare the frosting, Iskander wants to know the total surface in square centimeters to be colored for each of the three colors, and asks for your help.Input The input consists of the following integers:  - on the first line: the integer $n$,  - on the second line: the values of $A_1,\dots ,A_ n$, $n$ integers separated with single spaces,  - on the third line: the values of $B_1,\dots ,B_ n$, $n$ integers separated with single spaces.Limits The input satisfies $3\leq n \leq 100000$ and $1 \leq A_1,\ldots ,A_ n,B_1,\ldots ,B_ n \leq 10000$.Output The output should consist of three integers separated with single spaces, representing the total area for each color $0$, $1$, and $2$. -----
