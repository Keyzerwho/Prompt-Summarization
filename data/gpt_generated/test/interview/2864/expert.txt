 Given a set of cards dealt to you and a history of suggestions and evidence, you need to decide how close you are to being able to make an accusation. 
-----Input----- The input starts with an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 50$), the number of suggestions made during the game. Following this is a line containing the five cards you are dealt, all uppercase letters in the range ‘A’…‘U’. The remaining $n$ lines contain one suggestion per line. Each of these lines starts with three characters representing the suggestion (in the order person, weapon, room), followed by the responses of up to three players, beginning with the player to the right of the player making the suggestion. If a player presents no evidence, a ‘-’ (dash) is listed; otherwise an “evidence character” is listed. If the specific evidence card is seen by you (either because you provided it or you were the person receiving the evidence) then the evidence character identifies that card; otherwise the evidence character is ‘*’. Note that only the last response can be an evidence character. All characters are separated by single spaces. Only valid suggestion/response sequences appear in the input. -----Output----- Display a three character string identifying the murderer, the murder weapon, and the room. If the murderer can be identified, use the appropriate letter for that person; otherwise use ‘?’. Do the same for the murder weapon and the room. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 B I P C F A G M - - - Sample Output 1: AGM Sample Input 2: 2 A B C D H F G M M F H M - * Sample Output 2: E??
