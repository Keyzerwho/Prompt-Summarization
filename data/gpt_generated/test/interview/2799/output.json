The raven tries to reach the orchard through a pathway containing one or more steps. At each turn, the players roll a six-sided die. Four of the faces show a color (red, green, yellow, blue), the fifth face shows a fruit basket, and the sixth face shows a raven. All six faces can appear with equal probability. Your task is to determine the probability with which the players will win! # Input A space separated string of $4$ numbers, each representing the number of fruits left on a tree. E.g. ```3 2 1 2``` # Output A number representing the probability with which the players will win. E.g. ```0.75```\n",
