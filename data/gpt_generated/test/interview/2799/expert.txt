 # Task Given a game board with $4$ trees in an orchard, each bearing a different type of fruit: red apples, green apples, blue plums, and yellow pears. The raven tries to reach the orchard through a pathway containing one or more steps. At each turn, the players roll a six-sided die. Four of the faces show a color (red, green, yellow, blue), the fifth face shows a fruit basket, and the sixth face shows a raven. All six faces can appear with equal probability. Your task is to determine the probability with which the players will win! # Input A space separated string of $4$ numbers, each representing the number of fruits left on a tree. E.g. ```3 2 1 2``` # Output A number representing the probability with which the players will win. E.g. ```0.75```

-----Input----- The input consists of a single test case with a single line of input. The input contains five integer numbers: $R$, $G$, $B$, $Y$ and $S$. The values of $R, G, B$ and $Y$ are the number of red, green, blue, and yellow fruits initially on each tree, respectively, and $S$ denotes the number of steps on the ravenâ€™s pathway. Since the game is intended for young children, there will be at most $4$ fruits of each color: $0 \le R, G, B, Y \le 4$. There will be at least one fruit overall: $0 < R + G + B + Y$. The raven will require at least $1$ and at most $8$ steps: $1 \le S \le 8$. The number of steps is equal to the number of times the raven must appear on the die for the players to lose. -----Output----- Output the probability that the players will win as a floating point number. The absolute error of your result should be less than $10^{-5}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 1 0 0 3 Sample Output 1: 0.920138888889 Sample Input 2: 4 4 4 4 5 Sample Output 2: 0.631357306601
