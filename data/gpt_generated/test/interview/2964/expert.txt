 You are given the coordinates of the arrows hitting the target. Find the distance between any pair of arrows. 
-----Input----- The input starts with a line containing a single positive integer $C, 2 \le C \le 100000$, representing the number of shots for this particular contestant. Each following line contains a pair of integer coordinates separated by a space, representing the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of a successful shot. The absolute value of any coordinate does not exceed $1000$. -----Output----- Print the longest distance between any pair of arrows as a floating point number on a single line. The answer is considered correct if it has a relative or absolute error of less than $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 2 2 -1 -2 Sample Output: 5.0
