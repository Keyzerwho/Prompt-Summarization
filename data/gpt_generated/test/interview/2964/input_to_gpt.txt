It is Borya's eleventh birthday, and he has got a great present: n cards with numbers. The i-th card has the number a_{i} written on it. Borya wants to put his cards in a row to get one greater number. For example, if Borya has cards with numbers 1, 31, and 12, and he puts them in a row in this order, he would get a number 13112. He is only 11, but he already knows that there are n! ways to put his cards in a row. But today is a special day, so he is only interested in such ways that the resulting big number is divisible by eleven. So, the way from the previous paragraph is good, because 13112 = 1192   11, but if he puts the cards in the following order: 31, 1, 12, he would get a number 31112, it is not divisible by 11, so this way is not good for Borya. Help Borya to find out how many good ways to put the cards are there. Borya considers all cards different, even if some of them contain the same number. For example, if Borya has two cards with 1 on it, there are two good ways. Help Borya, find the number of good ways to put the cards. This number can be large, so output it modulo 998244353. 
tl;dr: You are given n cards with numbers. The i-th card has the number a_{i} written on it. You have to put cards in a row to get one greater number. There are n! ways to put his cards in a row. The resulting big number is divisible by eleven. Find out how many  ways are there to put the cards. Considers all cards different, even if some of them contain the same number.

Robert Hood, a less famous sibling of the Robin Hood, is fed up. Despite him being a young, talented archer he never seems to reach quite the same level as his legendary brother, and so he decided to come up with rules for a new archery contest, in which he will stand a better chance of winning. The rules for the new kind of archery contest are quite simple: the winner is no longer the one who can score the most points, but instead the one who can achieve the longest distance between any pair of arrows hitting the target. Your task is to write the code to calculate that distance. Each contestant is allowed a number of arrow shots, and the coordinates of the arrows successfully hitting the target are given as a list of pairs. The coordinate system is Cartesian with the origin in the centre of the archery butt. If a contestant does not hit the target with at least two arrows he or she is disqualified and removed from the input data.
