 Given the length of the message, the probabilities, and the encoded message, determine the original message.
-----Input----- The first line contains the integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 15$), which is the length of the original message. The second line contains the integer $D$ ($1 \leq D \leq 7$), which indicates that $p_ A = \frac{D}{8}$. The third line contains the binary representation of the encoded message. It is guaranteed that the binary representation of the encoded message starts with “0.” and contains at most $3N+2$ characters. It is guaranteed that the encoded message came from an initial message of length $N$ consisting only of ‘A’ and ‘B’ using this value of $p_ A$. -----Output----- Display the original message. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 4 0.0101 Sample Output: ABAB
