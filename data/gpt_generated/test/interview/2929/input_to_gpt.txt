In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in lexicographic order (that is, dictionary order). Each word should appear exactly once in your list. You can ignore the case (for instance, "The" and "the" are to be treated as the same word). There should be no uppercase letters in the output. For example, consider the following candidate for the input text:  This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem. The corresponding output would read as: a illustrate is of piece problem sample text this to 
tl;dr: You have to print the words in the given text in lexicographic order. Each word should appear exactly once and there should be no uppercase letters in the output. 

It is monsoon season, and your goldfish Orange is stuck at the bottom of a cave system in Thailand. Every hour, the water rises by $1$ meter. Thankfully, Orange has the ability to swim instantaneously from one location to another. However, he can t hop over the sharp rocks in the way. You trust that Orange is smart and will find the way out of the cave as soon as possible. To prepare Orange s meal, you want to write a program to find out how long it will take for Orange to come back home. You are given the cave system as an $N \times N$ grid where each location $(i, j)$ contains a nonnegative integer, $h_{i, j}$, representing the height of the rocks in meters at that location. Orange can only swim left, right, up, or down from one submerged location to another submerged location (but not diagonally). A location $(i, j)$ is submerged if the water level is at least $1$ meter higher than $h_{i, j}$. Orange s starting location will always be at $(0, 0)$, with $h_{0, 0} = 0$. The initial water level is $1$ meter so that Orange s start location is submerged. The only exit in the cave is at location $(N - 1, N - 1)$. After how many hours can Orange find his way to the exit
