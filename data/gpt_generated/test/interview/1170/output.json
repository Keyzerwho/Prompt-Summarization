Print the maximum possible number of 1's in such matrix. You don't have to solve this problem. Instead, you have to construct a few tests for it. You will be given t numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t}. For every $i \\in [ 1, t ]$, find two integers n_{i} and m_{i} (n_{i} m_{i}) such that the answer for the aforementioned problem is exactly x_{i} if we set n = n_{i} and m = m_{i}.",
