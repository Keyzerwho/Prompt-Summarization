You have to construct two sequences of integers $b$ and $c$ with length $n$ that satisfy: \nfor every $i$ ($1\\leq i\\leq n$) $b_i+c_i=a_i$ \n$b$ is non-decreasing, which means that for every $1<i\\leq n$, $b_i\\geq b_{i-1}$ must hold \n$c$ is non-increasing, which means that for every $1<i\\leq n$, $c_i\\leq c_{i-1}$ must hold \nYou have to minimize $\\max(b_i,c_i)$. In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences $b$ and $c$. Also there will be $q$ changes, the $i$-th change is described by three integers $l,r,x$. You should add $x$ to $a_l,a_{l+1}, \\ldots, a_r$. \nYou have to find the minimum possible value of $\\max(b_i,c_i)$ for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change. ",
