Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}]. Define its prefix product sequence $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 
tl;dr: Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}].  Let's define its prefix product sequence as $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 

Mr. Das is a teacher teaching for several years in a school. He is not computer savvy. Due to lockdown, now he has to take classes online. Recently he took an online exam for students of different classes. Now, he will call parents of all the students who scored lower than average marks for the class. He has requested you to give the name $X$, parent's phone number $P$, and marks obtained $M$ to him. 
tl;dr: You are given n students with their name, parent's phonenumber and marks of a class.Find all the students who scored lower than average marks for the class.  

Cengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named XORinacci numbers. He defined them as follows:   $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. You have to answer for $T$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. 

You are given a sequence of $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You have to construct two sequences of integers $b$ and $c$ with length $n$ that satisfy:  for every $i$ ($1\leq i\leq n$) $b_i+c_i=a_i$  $b$ is non-decreasing, which means that for every $1<i\leq n$, $b_i\geq b_{i-1}$ must hold  $c$ is non-increasing, which means that for every $1<i\leq n$, $c_i\leq c_{i-1}$ must hold  You have to minimize $\max(b_i,c_i)$. In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences $b$ and $c$. Also there will be $q$ changes, the $i$-th change is described by three integers $l,r,x$. You should add $x$ to $a_l,a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r$.  You have to find the minimum possible value of $\max(b_i,c_i)$ for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.
