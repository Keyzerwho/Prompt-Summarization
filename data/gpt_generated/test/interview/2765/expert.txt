 Given a set of coins, find the minimum number of coins required to dispense a given amount. 
-----Input----- Input consists of a single case. The first line contains an integer $n$ $(2 \leq n \leq 100)$, the number of denominations in the coin system. The next line contains the $n$ denominations as space-separated integers $c_1 \ c_2 \ \ldots \ c_ n$, where $c_1 = 1$ and $c_1 < c_2 < \ldots < c_ n \leq 10^6$. -----Output----- Output “canonical” if the coin system is canonical, or “non-canonical” if the coin system is non-canonical. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 1 2 4 8 Sample Output 1: canonical Sample Input 2: 3 1 5 8 Sample Output 2: non-canonical
