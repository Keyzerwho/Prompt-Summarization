 Given a Litespace program, produce the program s output. 
-----Input----- Input consists of a single non-empty string of characters from $\{ $‘T’, ‘N’, ‘S’$\} $ representing a valid sequence of Litespace instructions. The length of the string is at most $10000$. It is guaranteed that the Litespace program produces at least one line of output. Also, any integer pushed onto the stack or generated by a successful arithmetic operation will be less than $2^{31}$ in absolute value. -----Output----- Print the output of the Litespace program. -----Examples----- Sample Input: SSSTTSNTNST Sample Output: 6
