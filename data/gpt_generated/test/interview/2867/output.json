            "text": " Bash is celebrating his $13$th anniversary of dropping out of university and becoming a Pokenom trainer. For the celebration party, Bash decided to prepare cakes for his $N$ Pokenoms. The $i$-th Pokenom wants to eat the $i$-th cake. The cakes are made using some ingredients. Each ingredient is uniquely marked by a prime number between $1$ and $N$, inclusive. The recipe of the $X$-th cake contains $k$ grams of ingredient $p$ iff $p^{k}$ divides $X$, and $p^{k+1}$ does not. In other words, let the prime factorization of $X$ be $X = p_{1}^{k_{1}} \\times p_{2}^{k_{2}} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{m}^{k_{m}}$, the recipe of the $X$-th cake contains $k_{1}$ grams of ingredient $p_{1}, $k_{2}$ grams of ingredient $p_{2}, , $k_{m}$ grams of ingredient $p_{m}. Bash goes to a supermarket to buy ingredients. There, Bash realizes that the ingredients are very expensive. If Bash buys $k$ grams of ingredient $q$, Bash s happiness decreases by $k^{2} \\times C_{q}$. If the $i$-th Pokenom sees that Bash buys enough ingredient for the $i$-th cake, the Pokenom s happiness increases by $V_{i}$. Please help Bash buy ingredients so that the total happiness of Bash and his $N$ Pokenoms",
