The second line contains $N$ integers $p_{1}, \\dots, p_{N}$ ($1 \\leq p_{i} \\leq 10^9$). The third line contains $N$ integers $k_{1}, \\dots, k_{N}$ ($1 \\leq k_{i} \\leq 10^9$). The fourth line contains $N$ integers $C_{q}$ ($1 \\leq C_{q} \\leq 10^9$). The fifth line contains $N$ integers $V_{i}$ ($1 \\leq V_{i} \\leq 10^9$). Output The output should contain $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain a single integer - the amount of ingredients Bash should buy to maximize the total happiness of Bash and his $N$ Pokenoms. \n",
