You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide. We will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good. The angle between vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\operatorname{arccos}(\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\vec{y}|})$, where $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\vec{x}|= \sqrt{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is length of $\vec{x}$. Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.

You are given an array a with n distinct integers. Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k}} (1   x_{i}   n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e. $\sum_{i = 1}^{k} a_{x_{i}} \neq \sum_{i = 1}^{k} b_{x_{i}}$

Try guessing the statement from this picture:  $3$  You are given a non-negative integer $d$. You have to find two non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a + b = d$ and $a \cdot b = d$.

Years have passed since Bash dropped out of university to become a Pokenom trainer. The adventure was full of difficulties and hardship, but Bash overcame all obstacles and became the best Pokenom trainer, like no one ever was! Today Bash is celebrating his $13$th anniversary of dropping out of university and becoming a Pokenom trainer. For the celebration party, Bash decided to prepare cakes for his $N$ Pokenoms. Bash s Pokenoms are numbered from $1$ to $N$, inclusive. There are $N$ different cakes. The $i$-th Pokenom wants to eat the $i$-th cake. The cakes are made using some ingredients. Each ingredient is uniquely marked by a prime number between $1$ and $N$, inclusive. The recipe of the $X$-th cake contains $k$ grams of ingredient $p$ iff $p^{k}$ divides $X$, and $p^{k+1}$ does not. In other words, let the prime factorization of $X$ be $X = p_{1}^{k_{1}} \times p_{2}^{k_{2}} \times \cdots \times p_{m}^{k_{m}}$, the recipe of the $X$-th cake contains $k_{1}$ grams of ingredient $p_{1}$, $k_{2}$ grams of ingredient $p_{2}$,  , $k_{m}$ grams of ingredient $p_{m}$. Bash goes to a supermarket to buy ingredients. There, Bash realizes that the ingredients are very expensive. If Bash buys $k$ grams of ingredient $q$, Bash s happiness decreases by $k^{2} \times C_{q}$. If the $i$-th Pokenom sees that Bash buys enough ingredient for the $i$-th cake, the Pokenom s happiness increases by $V_{i}$. Please help Bash buy ingredients so that the total happiness of Bash and his $N$ Pokenoms is maximized! Note that the $i$-th Pokenom just needs to see that Bash has enough ingredients for the $i$-th cake. So even if the amount of ingredients Bash buys is enough to make either the $x$-th cake or the $y$-th cake, but not both, the total happiness still increases by $V_{x} + V_{y}$. For example, consider $N = 100$ and Bash buys $2$ grams of ingredient $2$, $1$ gram of ingredient $3$ and $1$ gram of ingredient $5$: Bash s happiness decreases by $4 \times C_{2} + 1 \times C_{3} + 1 \times C_{5}$. Bash has enough ingredients for cakes $1..6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30,$ and $60$. So the happiness of the Pokenoms increases by\[ V_{1} + V_{2} + \cdots + V_{6} + V_{10} + V_{12} + V_{15} + V_{20} + V_{30} + V_{60}. \]
