 Bash is celebrating his $13$th anniversary of dropping out of university and becoming a Pokenom trainer. For the celebration party, Bash decided to prepare cakes for his $N$ Pokenoms. The $i$-th Pokenom wants to eat the $i$-th cake. The cakes are made using some ingredients. Each ingredient is uniquely marked by a prime number between $1$ and $N$, inclusive. The recipe of the $X$-th cake contains $k$ grams of ingredient $p$ iff $p^{k}$ divides $X$, and $p^{k+1}$ does not. In other words, let the prime factorization of $X$ be $X = p_{1}^{k_{1}} \times p_{2}^{k_{2}} \times \cdots \times p_{m}^{k_{m}}$, the recipe of the $X$-th cake contains $k_{1}$ grams of ingredient $p_{1}, $k_{2}$ grams of ingredient $p_{2}, , $k_{m}$ grams of ingredient $p_{m}. Bash goes to a supermarket to buy ingredients. There, Bash realizes that the ingredients are very expensive. If Bash buys $k$ grams of ingredient $q$, Bash s happiness decreases by $k^{2} \times C_{q}$. If the $i$-th Pokenom sees that Bash buys enough ingredient for the $i$-th cake, the Pokenom s happiness increases by $V_{i}$. Please help Bash buy ingredients so that the total happiness of Bash and his $N$ Pokenoms
-----Input-----  - The first line contains one integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10^{4})$.  - The second line contains $N$ integers $V_{1}, V_{2}, \ldots V_{N}$$(0 \leq V_{i} \leq 10^{4})$.  - The third line contains $N$ integers $C_{1}, C_{2}, \ldots , C_{N}$$(0 \leq C_{i} \leq 10^{4})$. It is guaranteed that $C_{i} = 0$ if $i$ is not a prime. -----Output----- Print a single integer $B$ â€” the maximum total happiness of Bash and his Pokenoms. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 1 2 3 40 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 2 3 0 5 0 7 0 0 0 Sample Output 1: 51 Sample Input 2: 1 2207 0 Sample Output 2: 2207
