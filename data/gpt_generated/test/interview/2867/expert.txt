 Help Bash buy ingredients so that the total happiness of Bash and his $N$ Pokenoms is maximized. Input The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^9$). The second line contains $N$ integers $p_{1}, \dots, p_{N}$ ($1 \leq p_{i} \leq 10^9$). The third line contains $N$ integers $k_{1}, \dots, k_{N}$ ($1 \leq k_{i} \leq 10^9$). The fourth line contains $N$ integers $C_{q}$ ($1 \leq C_{q} \leq 10^9$). The fifth line contains $N$ integers $V_{i}$ ($1 \leq V_{i} \leq 10^9$). Output The output should contain $N$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain a single integer - the amount of ingredients Bash should buy to maximize the total happiness of Bash and his $N$ Pokenoms. 

-----Input-----  - The first line contains one integer $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10^{4})$.  - The second line contains $N$ integers $V_{1}, V_{2}, \ldots V_{N}$$(0 \leq V_{i} \leq 10^{4})$.  - The third line contains $N$ integers $C_{1}, C_{2}, \ldots , C_{N}$$(0 \leq C_{i} \leq 10^{4})$. It is guaranteed that $C_{i} = 0$ if $i$ is not a prime. -----Output----- Print a single integer $B$ â€” the maximum total happiness of Bash and his Pokenoms. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 1 2 3 40 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 2 3 0 5 0 7 0 0 0 Sample Output 1: 51 Sample Input 2: 1 2207 0 Sample Output 2: 2207
