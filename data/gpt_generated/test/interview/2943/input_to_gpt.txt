Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem: There are two arrays of integers $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. It turned out that array $a$ contains only elements from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:  Choose any pair of indexes $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$. It is possible to choose the same pair $(i, j)$ more than once.   Add $a_i$ to $a_j$. In other words, $j$-th element of the array becomes equal to $a_i + a_j$.  For example, if you are given array $[1, -1, 0]$, you can transform it only to $[1, -1, -1]$, $[1, 0, 0]$ and $[1, -1, 1]$ by one operation. Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $a$ so that it becomes equal to array $b$. Can you help him

There are some ambiguities when one writes Berland names with the letters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the Berland sound u can be written in the Latin alphabet as "u", and can be written as "oo". For this reason, two words "ulyana" and "oolyana" denote the same name. The second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both "h" and "kh" to write it. For example, the words "mihail" and "mikhail" denote the same name. There are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account  Formally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements "u" [Image] "oo" and "h" [Image] "kh", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements. For example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  "koouper" and "kuooper". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: "koouper" $\rightarrow$ "kuuper" and "kuooper" $\rightarrow$ "kuuper".  "khun" and "kkkhoon". With the replacements described above you can make both words to be equal: "khun" $\rightarrow$ "khoon" and "kkkhoon" $\rightarrow$ "kkhoon" $\rightarrow$ "khoon".  For a given list of words, find the minimal number of groups where the words in each group denote the same name.

Purple rain falls in the magic kingdom of Linearland which is a straight, thin peninsula.  On close observation however, Prof. Nelson Rogers finds that actually it is a mix of Red and Blue drops. In his zeal, he records the location and color of the raindrops in different locations along the peninsula. Looking at the data, Professor Rogers wants to know which part of Linearland had the  least  purple rain. After some thought, he decides to model this problem as follows. Divide the peninsula into $n$ sections and number them West to East from $1$ to $n$. Then, describe the raindrops as a sequence of R and B, depending on whether the rainfall in each section is primarily red or blue. Finally, find a subsequence of where the difference between the number of R and the number of B is maximized.
