You are given a graph with $3 \cdot n$ vertices and $m$ edges. You are to find a matching of $n$ edges, or an independent set of $n$ vertices. A set of edges is called a matching if no two edges share an endpoint. A set of vertices is called an independent set if no two vertices are connected with an edge.

# How many urinals are free  In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and the next person peeing.  For example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with  5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4). ![Imgur Urinals](https://i.imgur.com/imZE6xm.png) ## Your task: You need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule. ### Input A String containing 1s and 0s (
tl;dr: ## Your task: You need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer. ### Input A String containing 1s and 0s (1 <= Length <= 20)   A one stands for a taken urinal and a zero for a free one.  ### 

Purple rain falls in the magic kingdom of Linearland which is a straight, thin peninsula.  On close observation however, Prof. Nelson Rogers finds that actually it is a mix of Red and Blue drops. In his zeal, he records the location and color of the raindrops in different locations along the peninsula. Looking at the data, Professor Rogers wants to know which part of Linearland had the  least  purple rain. After some thought, he decides to model this problem as follows. Divide the peninsula into $n$ sections and number them West to East from $1$ to $n$. Then, describe the raindrops as a sequence of R and B, depending on whether the rainfall in each section is primarily red or blue. Finally, find a subsequence of where the difference between the number of R and the number of B is maximized.
