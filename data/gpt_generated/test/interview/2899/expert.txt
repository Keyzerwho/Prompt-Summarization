 You are given a tree graph. You have to find a way to assign frequencies to nodes such that the total number of frequencies used is maximized. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - one line with one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10000$), the number of nodes in the network;  - $n-1$ lines, each with two space-separated integers $i$ and $j$, with $1 \leq i,j \leq n$ signifying that the (one-indexed) network nodes $i$ and $j$ are in range of each other. -----Output----- Output a frequency assignment for each of the $2n$ NICs such that all adjacent nodes can communicate and the number of used frequencies is maximized. You should output $n$ lines, where the $i$th line contains the two frequencies of network node $i$. Valid frequencies are nonnegative integers less than $10^9$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 2 1 2 Sample Output: 23 42 42 23
