Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $\{0,1, ,M-1\}$, for some positive integer $M$. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo $M$. What are the residues modulo $M$ that Ajs cannot obtain with this action

**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #18 Create a function called that accepts 2 string arguments and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one. If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

Simone is learning to trade crypto currencies. Right now, she is looking into a new currency called CryptoKattis. A CryptoKattis can be used to improve your Kattis ranklist score without having to solve problems. Simone, unlike most competitive programmers, is very perceptive of competition trends. She has lately noticed many coders talking about a new online judge called Doggo, and suspect that using the Kattis judge will soon fall out of fashion. This, of course, will cause the CryptoKattis to rapidly fall in value once demand fades. To take advantage of this, Simone has performed very careful market research. This has allowed her to estimate the price of a CryptoKattis in dollars during the next $N$ days. She intends to use this data to perform a short sell. This means she will at some day borrow $100$ CryptoKattis from a bank, immediately selling the currency. At some other day, she must purchase the same amount of CryptoKattis to repay her loan. For every day between (and including) these two days, she must pay $K$ dollars in interest. What is the maximum profit Simone can make by carefully choosing when to borrow and repay the $100$ CryptoKattis
