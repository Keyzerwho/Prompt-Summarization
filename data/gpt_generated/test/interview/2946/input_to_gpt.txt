tl;dr: # Task You are given some sticks by an array `V` of positive integers, where V[i] represents the length of the sticks, find the number of ways we can choose three of them to form a triangle. # 

You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd (not divisible by $2$) then assign (set) $a[\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ (where $i$ is the number of the current action), otherwise (if $r-l+1$ is even) assign (set) $a[\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$.  Consider the array $a$ of length $5$ (initially $a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$). Then it changes as follows:  Firstly, we choose the segment $[1; 5]$ and assign $a[3] := 1$, so $a$ becomes $[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[1; 2]$ and assign $a[1] := 2$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 0, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[4; 5]$ and assign $a[4] := 3$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 0, 1, 3, 0]$;  then we choose the segment $[2; 2]$ and assign $a[2] := 4$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]$;  and at last we choose the segment $[5; 5]$ and assign $a[5] := 5$, so $a$ becomes $[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]$.  Your task is to find the array $a$ of length $n$ after performing all $n$ actions. Note that the answer exists and unique. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.

You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ integers numbered from $1$ to $n$. Let's define the $k$-amazing number of the array as the minimum number that occurs in all of the subsegments of the array having length $k$ (recall that a subsegment of $a$ of length $k$ is a contiguous part of $a$ containing exactly $k$ elements). If there is no integer occuring in all subsegments of length $k$ for some value of $k$, then the $k$-amazing number is $-1$. For each $k$ from $1$ to $n$ calculate the $k$-amazing number of the array $a$.

Simone is learning to trade crypto currencies. Right now, she is looking into a new currency called CryptoKattis. A CryptoKattis can be used to improve your Kattis ranklist score without having to solve problems. Simone, unlike most competitive programmers, is very perceptive of competition trends. She has lately noticed many coders talking about a new online judge called Doggo, and suspect that using the Kattis judge will soon fall out of fashion. This, of course, will cause the CryptoKattis to rapidly fall in value once demand fades. To take advantage of this, Simone has performed very careful market research. This has allowed her to estimate the price of a CryptoKattis in dollars during the next $N$ days. She intends to use this data to perform a short sell. This means she will at some day borrow $100$ CryptoKattis from a bank, immediately selling the currency. At some other day, she must purchase the same amount of CryptoKattis to repay her loan. For every day between (and including) these two days, she must pay $K$ dollars in interest. What is the maximum profit Simone can make by carefully choosing when to borrow and repay the $100$ CryptoKattis
