Gildong recently learned how to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in $O(n\log{n})$ time for a sequence of length $n$. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn't find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he's going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, to test his code with your output. The quiz is as follows. Gildong provides a string of length $n-1$, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element. He wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible. 
tl;dr: Give a string of length $n-1$, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element. Find two possible sequences consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the second sequence is maximum possible. 

# Task Elections are in progress! Given an array of numbers representing votes given to each of the candidates, and an integer which is equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election. The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all. **Note**: big arrays will be tested. #

A new town is being planned, and the designers have some very specific ideas about how things should be laid out. First, they lay out the streets. Each street is perfectly straight and passes completely from one end of the town to the other. These streets divide the town into regions, and each region is to be designated either  residential  or  commercial.  The town planners require that any two regions directly across the street from one another must have different designations. On this one particular day, all of the streets have been planned, but none of the regions have been designated. One town planner wishes to purchase two properties, and it is important to him that the properties eventually have different designations. For this problem, the streets can be modeled by lines in the plane that extend forever in both directions and have no width, and properties may be modeled by points. Given the lines and two points, can you decide whether or not they must get different designations,  commercial  or  residential
