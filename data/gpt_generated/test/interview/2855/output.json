You quickly look up a map of the woods. It appears that the woods consist of a small number of clearings, with paths connecting them. You hope that the woods are sufficiently small and simple that your friend can get out easily, even if he is just randomly running around. From your friend s description, you can figure out at which clearing he is. Assuming that every time he reaches a clearing, he runs in a uniformly random direction (including back the way he came), and that it takes him exactly one minute to get from clearing to clearing, can you predict how long it will take him to get out on average ",
