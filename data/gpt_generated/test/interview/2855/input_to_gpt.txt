=====Problem Statement===== A newly opened multinational brand has decided to base their company logo on the three most common characters in the company name. They are now trying out various combinations of company names and logos based on this condition. Given a string s, which is the company name in lowercase letters, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string. Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count. Sort in descending order of occurrence count. If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in alphabetical order. For example, according to the conditions described above, GOOGLE would have it's logo with the letters G, O, E.  
tl;dr: =====Problem Statement===== Given a string s in lowercase, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string and their occurance count. Sort in descending order of occurrence count, and then by alphabetical order to break ties. For example, GOOGLE would output G 2 O 2 E 1 

Johnny has just found the new, great tutorial: "How to become a grandmaster ". The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems.  The boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked $p^{k_i}$ problems from $i$-th category ($p$ is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced. Formally, given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 
tl;dr: Given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, divide them into two disjoint sets. Find the minimal absolute difference between the two sets. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 

Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}]. Define its prefix product sequence $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 
tl;dr: Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}].  Let's define its prefix product sequence as $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 

Your friend has gotten lost in the woods. He has called and asked for you to come get him, but you are very busy and would rather just stay home. You quickly look up a map of the woods. It appears that the woods consist of a small number of clearings, with paths connecting them. You hope that the woods are sufficiently small and simple that your friend can get out easily, even if he is just randomly running around. From your friend s description, you can figure out at which clearing he is. Assuming that every time he reaches a clearing, he runs in a uniformly random direction (including back the way he came), and that it takes him exactly one minute to get from clearing to clearing, can you predict how long it will take him to get out on average
