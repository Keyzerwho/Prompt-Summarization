 You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 200000$), the number of events. The second line of input contains $N$ integers, $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$ ($1 \leq P_ i \leq N$; all $P_ i$ are distinct), the order of events according to the prosecution. That is, according to the prosecution, the $i^\text {th}$ event was the event labelled $P_ i$. The third line of input contains $N$ integers, $D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$ ($1 \leq D_ i \leq N$; all $D_ i$ are distinct), the order of events according to the defense. That is, according to the defense, the $i^\text {th}$ event was the event labelled $D_ i$. It is guaranteed that the prosecution and defense do not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists some $i$ such that $P_ i \neq D_ i$. -----Output----- Output two integers on a single line, the minimum values of $k_ p$ and $k_ r$, respectively, as described in the problem statement. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 2 4 1 1 3 4 2 Sample Output: 2 3
