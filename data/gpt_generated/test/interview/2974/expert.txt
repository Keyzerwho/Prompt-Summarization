 Write a function named `getMinimalReconstructions`, taking a sequence of events as single parameter. Your function must return the minimum number of events such that there is a consistent recollection of this number of events where it is possible to determine for sure who is right, and the minimum number of events such that for any consistent recollection of this number of events, it is possible to determine for sure who is right. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 200000$), the number of events. The second line of input contains $N$ integers, $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$ ($1 \leq P_ i \leq N$; all $P_ i$ are distinct), the order of events according to the prosecution. That is, according to the prosecution, the $i^\text {th}$ event was the event labelled $P_ i$. The third line of input contains $N$ integers, $D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$ ($1 \leq D_ i \leq N$; all $D_ i$ are distinct), the order of events according to the defense. That is, according to the defense, the $i^\text {th}$ event was the event labelled $D_ i$. It is guaranteed that the prosecution and defense do not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists some $i$ such that $P_ i \neq D_ i$. -----Output----- Output two integers on a single line, the minimum values of $k_ p$ and $k_ r$, respectively, as described in the problem statement. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 2 4 1 1 3 4 2 Sample Output: 2 3
