Ms. E.T. came from planet Hex. She has 8 fingers in each hand which makes her count in hexadecimal way. When she meets you, she tells you that she came from 7E light years from the planet Earth. You see she means that it is 126 light years far away and she is telling you the numbers in hexadecimal. Now, you are in trouble to understand what those numbers really mean. Therefore, you have to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimals. 
tl;dr: Write the code to convert the hexadecimal number into its corresponding decimal value. 

# Task Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence. Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.  ## Input * sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.  For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`)

 [There] is a reason why the most successful trial lawyers are often master storytellers, making their cases come to life for their jurors.    G. Christopher Ritter. A good lawyer can take an incomplete set of facts and turn it into a convincing story. Last night, a major robbery occurred at a bank, and, luckily, the robber seems to have been successfully arrested. Unfortunately, it is neither clear what the order of events was, nor whether the man they caught is even really the right guy. It is necessary to reconstruct the correct order of events to convince the jury that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt for a conviction to be reached. It is known that there are $N$ material events that are relevant to the case. For simplicity, we label the events $1, 2, \dots , N$. The prosecution claims that these events happened in the order $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$, while the defense claims that these events instead happened in the order $D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$. It is guaranteed that exactly one of the two is right; in particular, this also means that the prosecution and defense do not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists some $i$ such that $P_ i \neq D_ i$. Define a consistent recollection as a subset of the $N$ events, in some order, such that these events happening in this order is consistent with at least one of the two parties  claims. (That is, at least one of the parties claimed that this subset of events did happen in this order, although it is possible that some other events happened before, after, or in between.) You need to determine  - the minimum $k_ p$ such that there is some consistent recollection of $k_ p$ events where it is possible to determine for sure who is right, and  - the minimum $k_ r$ such that for any consistent recollection of $k_ r$ events, it is possible to determine for sure who is right. By finding these numbers, you can help the prosecution estimate the minimum amount of evidence they need to make their case, and the minimum amount of evidence they need to make their case foolproof. (Or determine that the man they have is really innocent.) Please help!
