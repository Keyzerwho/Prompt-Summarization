**This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students** All Star Code Challenge #16 Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the **first** not repeated character in the entire string. ``` haskell noRepeat "aabbccdde" `shouldBe` 'e' noRepeat "wxyz"      `shouldBe` 'w' noRepeat "testing"   `shouldBe` 'e' ``` 
tl;dr: Create a function called noRepeat() that takes a string argument and returns a single letter string of the first not repeated character in the entire string. 

You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $A$, $B$ and $C$.  Find the number of different groups of three integers ($a$, $b$, $c$) such that $1\leq a\leq b\leq c$ and parallelepiped $A\times B\times C$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $a\times b\times c$. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction. For example, parallelepiped $1\times 5\times 6$ can be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 3\times 5$, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds $1\times 2\times 3$.

Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

 [There] is a reason why the most successful trial lawyers are often master storytellers, making their cases come to life for their jurors.    G. Christopher Ritter. A good lawyer can take an incomplete set of facts and turn it into a convincing story. Last night, a major robbery occurred at a bank, and, luckily, the robber seems to have been successfully arrested. Unfortunately, it is neither clear what the order of events was, nor whether the man they caught is even really the right guy. It is necessary to reconstruct the correct order of events to convince the jury that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt for a conviction to be reached. It is known that there are $N$ material events that are relevant to the case. For simplicity, we label the events $1, 2, \dots , N$. The prosecution claims that these events happened in the order $P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$, while the defense claims that these events instead happened in the order $D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$. It is guaranteed that exactly one of the two is right; in particular, this also means that the prosecution and defense do not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists some $i$ such that $P_ i \neq D_ i$. Define a consistent recollection as a subset of the $N$ events, in some order, such that these events happening in this order is consistent with at least one of the two parties  claims. (That is, at least one of the parties claimed that this subset of events did happen in this order, although it is possible that some other events happened before, after, or in between.) You need to determine  - the minimum $k_ p$ such that there is some consistent recollection of $k_ p$ events where it is possible to determine for sure who is right, and  - the minimum $k_ r$ such that for any consistent recollection of $k_ r$ events, it is possible to determine for sure who is right. By finding these numbers, you can help the prosecution estimate the minimum amount of evidence they need to make their case, and the minimum amount of evidence they need to make their case foolproof. (Or determine that the man they have is really innocent.) Please help!
