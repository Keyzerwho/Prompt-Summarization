Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (x_{i}, y_{i}). They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|. Daniel, as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula $\sqrt{(x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} +(y_{i} - y_{j})^{2}}$. The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i, j) (1   i < j   n), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

Students went into a class to write a test and sat in some way. The teacher thought: "Probably they sat in this order to copy works of each other. I need to rearrange them in such a way that students that were neighbors are not neighbors in a new seating." The class can be represented as a matrix with n rows and m columns with a student in each cell. Two students are neighbors if cells in which they sit have a common side. Let's enumerate students from 1 to n m in order of rows. So a student who initially sits in the cell in row i and column j has a number (i - 1) m + j. You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 

Gunnar and his friends like games which involve rolling dice. Gunnar has a huge collection of 6-sided, 12-sided and 20-sided dice. All the games with dice started to bore him, so he came up with a new game. He rolls an $s$-sided die $n$ times and wins if at least $k$ different numbers appear in the $n$ throws. An $s$-sided die contains $s$ distinct numbers $1, \dots , s$ on its sides. Since this is a game only for one person, Gunnar and his friends decided to make it more fun by letting other people bet on a particular game. Before you bet on a particular game, you would like to know how probable it is to throw at least $k$ different numbers in $n$ throws with an $s$-sided die. We assume that all numbers have the same probability of being thrown in each throw.
