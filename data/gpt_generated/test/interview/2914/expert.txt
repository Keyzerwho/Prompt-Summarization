 You are given an integer $s$, an integer $n$, and an integer $k$. You are also given a number $s$ which represents the number of sides of a die. You are asked to compute the probability of throwing at least $k$ different numbers in $n$ throws with an $s$-sided die. 

-----Input----- The input consists of a single line with three integers $n$, $s$, and $k$ ($1\le n\le 10000, 1 \le k \le s \le 500$). $n$ is the number of throws, $k$ the number of different numbers that are needed to win and $s$ is the number of sides the die has. -----Output----- Output one line with the probability that a player throws at least $k$ different numbers within $n$ throws with an $s$-sided die. Your answer should be within absolute or relative error at most $10^{-7}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 2 Sample Output: 0.888888889
