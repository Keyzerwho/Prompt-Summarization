The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, $n$ is always even, and in C2, $n$ is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with $2 \cdot n$ vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length $1$. Let's name it as $2n$-gon. Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed $2n$-gon in the square. Embedding $2n$-gon in the square means that you need to place $2n$-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of $2n$-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can rotate $2n$-gon and/or the square.

The chef was searching for his pen in the garage but he found his old machine with a display and some numbers on it. If some numbers entered then some different output occurs on the display. Chef wants to crack the algorithm that the machine is following.

Given a string containing a list of integers separated by commas, write the function string_to_int_list(s) that takes said string and returns a new list containing all integers present in the string, preserving the order. For example, give the string "-1,2,3,4,5", the function string_to_int_list() should return [-1,2,3,4,5] Please note that there can be one or more consecutive commas whithout numbers, like so: "-1,-2,,,,,,3,4,5,,6

This problem differs from the next one only in the presence of the constraint on the equal length of all numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. Actually, this problem is a subtask of the problem D2 from the same contest and the solution of D2 solves this subtask too. A team of SIS students is going to make a trip on a submarine. Their target is an ancient treasure in a sunken ship lying on the bottom of the Great Rybinsk sea. Unfortunately, the students don't know the coordinates of the ship, so they asked Meshanya (who is a hereditary mage) to help them. He agreed to help them, but only if they solve his problem. Let's denote a function that alternates digits of two numbers $f(a_1 a_2 \dots a_{p - 1} a_p, b_1 b_2 \dots b_{q - 1} b_q)$, where $a_1 \dots a_p$ and $b_1 \dots b_q$ are digits of two integers written in the decimal notation without leading zeros. In other words, the function $f(x, y)$ alternately shuffles the digits of the numbers $x$ and $y$ by writing them from the lowest digits to the older ones, starting with the number $y$. The result of the function is also built from right to left (that is, from the lower digits to the older ones). If the digits of one of the arguments have ended, then the remaining digits of the other argument are written out. Familiarize with examples and formal definitions of the function below. For example: $$f(1111, 2222) = 12121212$$ $$f(7777, 888) = 7787878$$ $$f(33, 44444) = 4443434$$ $$f(555, 6) = 5556$$ $$f(111, 2222) = 2121212$$ Formally,  if $p \ge q$ then $f(a_1 \dots a_p, b_1 \dots b_q) = a_1 a_2 \dots a_{p - q + 1} b_1 a_{p - q + 2} b_2 \dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$;  if $p < q$ then $f(a_1 \dots a_p, b_1 \dots b_q) = b_1 b_2 \dots b_{q - p} a_1 b_{q - p + 1} a_2 \dots a_{p - 1} b_{q - 1} a_p b_q$.  Mishanya gives you an array consisting of $n$ integers $a_i$. All numbers in this array are of equal length (that is, they consist of the same number of digits). Your task is to help students to calculate $\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{n} f(a_i, a_j)$ modulo $998\,244\,353$.
