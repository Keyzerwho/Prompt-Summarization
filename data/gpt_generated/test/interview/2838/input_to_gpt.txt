The sequence of $m$ integers is called the permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $m$ exactly once. The number $m$ is called the length of the permutation. Dreamoon has two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$ of non-zero lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. Now Dreamoon concatenates these two permutations into another sequence $a$ of length $l_1 + l_2$. First $l_1$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_1$ and next $l_2$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_2$.  You are given the sequence $a$, and you need to find two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$. If there are several possible ways to restore them, you should find all of them. (Note that it is also possible that there will be no ways.)

# Task  Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform.  The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. Check out the image below to see all valid moves for a knight piece that is placed on one of the central squares.  ![](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/chessKnight/img/knight.jpg _tm=1473533979951) #

Mirko was bored at his chemistry class, so he played Bomb Switcher on his cell phone. Unfortunately, he was spotted and was given a ridiculously heavy assignment for homework. For a given valid math expression with brackets, he must find all different expressions that can be obtained by removing valid pairs of brackets from the original expression. Two expressions are different if there is a character at which they differ. For example, given $(2+(2*2)+2)$, one can get $(2+2*2+2)$, $2+(2*2)+2$, and $2+2*2+2$. $(2+2*2)+2$ and $2+(2*2+2)$ can t be reached, since we would have to remove pairs of brackets that are not valid. More than one pairs of brackets can surround the same part of the expression.
