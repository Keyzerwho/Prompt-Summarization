For a given valid math expression with brackets, he must find all different expressions that can be obtained by removing valid pairs of brackets from the original expression. Two expressions are different if there is a character at which they differ. For example, given $(2+(2*2)+2)$, one can get $(2+2*2+2),$ $2+(2*2)+2$, and $2+2*2+2$. $(2+2*2)+2$ and $2+(2*2+2)$ can t be reached, since we would have to remove pairs of brackets that are not valid. More than one pairs of brackets can surround the same part of the expression.",
