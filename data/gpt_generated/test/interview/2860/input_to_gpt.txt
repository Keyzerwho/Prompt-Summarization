Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}]. Define its prefix product sequence $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 
tl;dr: Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}].  Let's define its prefix product sequence as $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 

Arkady needs your help again! This time he decided to build his own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of n nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network (a wire directly connects two nodes). Exactly k of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability. Arkady wants to make the system as fast as possible, so he wants to minimize the maximum distance between two exit-nodes. The distance between two nodes is the number of wires a package needs to go through between those two nodes. Help Arkady to find such a way to build the network that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is as small as possible. 
tl;dr: You want to build your own high-speed Internet exchange point. It should consist of n nodes connected with minimum possible number of wires into one network. Exactly k of the nodes should be exit-nodes, that means that each of them should be connected to exactly one other node of the network, while all other nodes should be connected to at least two nodes in order to increase the system stability. Find the Minimum Spanning Tree between two exit-nodes. 

There are N pinholes on the xy-plane. The i-th pinhole is located at (x_i,y_i). We will denote the Manhattan distance between the i-th and j-th pinholes as d(i,j)(=|x_i-x_j|+|y_i-y_j|). You have a peculiar pair of compasses, called Manhattan Compass. This instrument always points at two of the pinholes. The two legs of the compass are indistinguishable, thus we do not distinguish the following two states: the state where the compass points at the p-th and q-th pinholes, and the state where it points at the q-th and p-th pinholes. When the compass points at the p-th and q-th pinholes and d(p,q)=d(p,r), one of the legs can be moved so that the compass will point at the p-th and r-th pinholes. Initially, the compass points at the a-th and b-th pinholes. Find the number of the pairs of pinholes that can be pointed by the compass. -----Constraints-----  - 2 N 10^5  - 1 x_i, y_i 10^9  - 1 a < b N  - When i   j, (x_i, y_i)   (x_j, y_j)  - x_i and y_i are integers. 
tl;dr: You are given N coordinates on the xy-plane. A given compass can point to (p,q) or (p,r) when d(p,q) = d(p,r) where d is the Manhattan distance. Initially, you are at (a,b) coordinates. You need to find the number of pairs of coordinates such that the compass can point. -----Constraints-----  - 2 N 10^5  - 1 x_i, y_i 10^9  - 1 a < b N  - When i   j, (x_i, y_i)   (x_j, y_j)  - x_i and y_i are integers. 

You are a stone-chiseler in Ancient Greece, charged with copying the text from famous monuments onto new stones. The existing inscriptions use boustrophedon writing, in which the lines of text alternate direction, and if a line ends in the middle of a word, the word simply continues on the next line. For example, an inscription may look like this: IN.HONOR.OF.THE.INTERNAT TEPMOC.GNIMMARGORP.LANOI ITION (In the original boustrophedon style, no spaces or punctuation were used between words, but here we have introduced periods between words.) Today, however, you have been asked to copy these over into the new-fangled style where each line runs left to right, and words will not be split across lines   if there is not room for a whole word on a particular line, it will be started on the next line. So, the inscription above might instead look like this: IN.HONOR.OF.THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING.COMPETITION Of course, before you get started, you will need to know what size of stone will be required for your inscription. The width of the stone will be given, and the length for you to determine.
