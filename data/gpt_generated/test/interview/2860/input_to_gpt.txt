It is Borya's eleventh birthday, and he has got a great present: n cards with numbers. The i-th card has the number a_{i} written on it. Borya wants to put his cards in a row to get one greater number. For example, if Borya has cards with numbers 1, 31, and 12, and he puts them in a row in this order, he would get a number 13112. He is only 11, but he already knows that there are n! ways to put his cards in a row. But today is a special day, so he is only interested in such ways that the resulting big number is divisible by eleven. So, the way from the previous paragraph is good, because 13112 = 1192   11, but if he puts the cards in the following order: 31, 1, 12, he would get a number 31112, it is not divisible by 11, so this way is not good for Borya. Help Borya to find out how many good ways to put the cards are there. Borya considers all cards different, even if some of them contain the same number. For example, if Borya has two cards with 1 on it, there are two good ways. Help Borya, find the number of good ways to put the cards. This number can be large, so output it modulo 998244353. 
tl;dr: You are given n cards with numbers. The i-th card has the number a_{i} written on it. You have to put cards in a row to get one greater number. There are n! ways to put his cards in a row. The resulting big number is divisible by eleven. Find out how many  ways are there to put the cards. Considers all cards different, even if some of them contain the same number.  

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).  Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.  Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

You are a stone-chiseler in Ancient Greece, charged with copying the text from famous monuments onto new stones. The existing inscriptions use boustrophedon writing, in which the lines of text alternate direction, and if a line ends in the middle of a word, the word simply continues on the next line. For example, an inscription may look like this: IN.HONOR.OF.THE.INTERNAT TEPMOC.GNIMMARGORP.LANOI ITION (In the original boustrophedon style, no spaces or punctuation were used between words, but here we have introduced periods between words.) Today, however, you have been asked to copy these over into the new-fangled style where each line runs left to right, and words will not be split across lines   if there is not room for a whole word on a particular line, it will be started on the next line. So, the inscription above might instead look like this: IN.HONOR.OF.THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING.COMPETITION Of course, before you get started, you will need to know what size of stone will be required for your inscription. The width of the stone will be given, and the length for you to determine.
