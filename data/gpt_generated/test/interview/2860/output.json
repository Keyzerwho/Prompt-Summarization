            "text": " You are a stone-chiseler in Ancient Greece, charged with copying the text from famous monuments onto new stones. The existing inscriptions use boustrophedon writing, in which the lines of text alternate direction, and if a line ends in the middle of a word, the word simply continues on the next line. For example, an inscription may look like this: IN.HONOR.OF.THE.INTERNAT TEPMOC.GNIMMARGORP.LANOI ITION (In the original boustrophedon style, no spaces or punctuation were used between words, but here we have introduced periods between words.) Today, however, you have been asked to copy these over into the new-fangled style where each line runs left to right, and words will not be split across lines   if there is not room for a whole word on a particular line, it will be started on the next line. So, the inscription above might instead look like this: IN.HONOR.OF.THE INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING.COMPETITION Of course, before you get started, you will need to know what size of stone will be required for your inscription. The width of the stone will be given, and the length for you to determine.",
