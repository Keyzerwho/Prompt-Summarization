Students went into a class to write a test and sat in some way. The teacher thought: "Probably they sat in this order to copy works of each other. I need to rearrange them in such a way that students that were neighbors are not neighbors in a new seating." The class can be represented as a matrix with n rows and m columns with a student in each cell. Two students are neighbors if cells in which they sit have a common side. Let's enumerate students from 1 to n m in order of rows. So a student who initially sits in the cell in row i and column j has a number (i - 1) m + j. You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 

It s another day in the office, and you re a mastermind of not doing any work yourself. Instead, you ll go to your coworkers for  help,  but secretly have them do all the work. You ve determined that the more one of your coworkers helps you, the more annoyed they become. You ve also been able to determine how much more annoyed a coworker gets everytime you ask them for help. At the beginning of the day, a coworker is initially $a$ annoyed at you. That s their annoyance level. Everytime you ask them for help though, they become $d$ more annoyed at you   their annoyance level $a$ increases by a constant amount $d$ so that $a=a+d$. You want to complete a project of $h$ tasks solely with  help  from your coworkers, but you need to be careful not to annoy any of them too much. What s the best you can do
