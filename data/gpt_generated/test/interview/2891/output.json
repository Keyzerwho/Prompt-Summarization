            "text": " The Birthday Paradox is the name given to the surprising fact that if there are just $23$ people in a group, there is a greater than $50\\% $ chance that a pair of them share the same birthday. The underlying assumptions for this are that all birthdays are equally likely (which isn t quite true), the year has exactly $365$ days (which also isn t true), and the people in the group are uniformly randomly selected (which is a somewhat strange premise). For this problem, we ll accept these assumptions. Consider what we might observe if we randomly select groups of $P=10$ people. Once we have chosen a group, we break them up into subgroups based on shared birthdays. Among many other possibilities, we might observe the following distributions of shared birthdays:  - all $10$ have different birthdays, or  - all $10$ have the same birthday, or  - $3$ people have the same birthday, $2$ other people have the same birthday (on a different day), and the remaining $5$ all have different birthdays. Of course, these distributions have different probabilities of occurring. Your job is to calculate this probability for a given distribution of people sharing birthdays. That is, if there are $P$ people in a group, how probable is the given distribution of shared birthdays (among all possible distributions for $P$ people chosen uniformly at random) ",
