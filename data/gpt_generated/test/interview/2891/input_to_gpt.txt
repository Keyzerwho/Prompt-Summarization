Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i]. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties. Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins. Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.   
tl;dr: Alex and Lee play a game with a list of numbers. There are an even number of elements in the list and each value has a positive integer number. The objective of the game is to end with largest value. The total sum of values is odd, so there are no ties. Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first. Each turn, a player takes value from either the beginning or the end of the list. This continues until there are no more values left, at which point the person with the largest value wins. Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game. 

Let's denote as $\text{popcount}(x)$ the number of bits set ('1' bits) in the binary representation of the non-negative integer x. You are given multiple queries consisting of pairs of integers l and r. For each query, find the x, such that l   x   r, and $\text{popcount}(x)$ is maximum possible. If there are multiple such numbers find the smallest of them.

You are given a sequence of $n$ digits $d_1d_2 \dots d_{n}$. You need to paint all the digits in two colors so that:  each digit is painted either in the color $1$ or in the color $2$;  if you write in a row from left to right all the digits painted in the color $1$, and then after them all the digits painted in the color $2$, then the resulting sequence of $n$ digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be greater than or equal to the previous digit).  For example, for the sequence $d=914$ the only valid coloring is $211$ (paint in the color $1$ two last digits, paint in the color $2$ the first digit). But $122$ is not a valid coloring ($9$ concatenated with $14$ is not a non-decreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used at all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive positions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or determine that it is impossible to do.

The Birthday Paradox is the name given to the surprising fact that if there are just $23$ people in a group, there is a greater than $50\% $ chance that a pair of them share the same birthday. The underlying assumptions for this are that all birthdays are equally likely (which isn t quite true), the year has exactly $365$ days (which also isn t true), and the people in the group are uniformly randomly selected (which is a somewhat strange premise). For this problem, we ll accept these assumptions. Consider what we might observe if we randomly select groups of $P=10$ people. Once we have chosen a group, we break them up into subgroups based on shared birthdays. Among many other possibilities, we might observe the following distributions of shared birthdays:  - all $10$ have different birthdays, or  - all $10$ have the same birthday, or  - $3$ people have the same birthday, $2$ other people have the same birthday (on a different day), and the remaining $5$ all have different birthdays. Of course, these distributions have different probabilities of occurring. Your job is to calculate this probability for a given distribution of people sharing birthdays. That is, if there are $P$ people in a group, how probable is the given distribution of shared birthdays (among all possible distributions for $P$ people chosen uniformly at random)
