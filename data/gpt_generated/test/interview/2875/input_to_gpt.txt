You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number. Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.  Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order. 
tl;dr: You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number in a pair. A chain if formed when a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Find the length of longest chain which can be formed.  

A simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1 
tl;dr: You have find out the frequency of letters in a given string and print it as the new string which comprises of the letter followed by its frequency.For example string is- abcdabf. Then the new string is- a2b2c1d1f1 

Johnny has just found the new, great tutorial: "How to become a grandmaster ". The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems.  The boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked $p^{k_i}$ problems from $i$-th category ($p$ is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced. Formally, given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 
tl;dr: Given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, divide them into two disjoint sets. Find the minimal absolute difference between the two sets. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 

As a huge fan of the popular collectible card game Numinous Wilds: the Elven Reign Chronicles (NWERC), you have a large collection of cards which you carefully organise by their rarity. One day you notice that someone has touched your collection, and that some of the cards are now out of order. The most natural suspect, of course, is your little brother Billy, who was absolutely $100\% $ forbidden from playing with your cards. After a few minutes of interrogation Billy confesses that he indeed took a few consecutive cards from the middle of the stack, but he swears that he put them back in exactly the same order as they were. You suspect that Billy, being so young, may have simply mistakenly reversed the order of the cards that he took. Now you want to check your theory and decide if you can find the batch of cards that Billy took to play with.  Is it possible to restore the order of the cards into non-decreasing order of their rarity by reversing just one contiguous batch of cards
