 Given a list of cards sorted by their rarity, find the batch of cards that can be reversed to restore the order of the cards into non-decreasing order of their rarity.
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$), the number of cards in your collection.  - One line containing $n$ integers $v_1, \ldots , v_ n$ ($1 \le v_{i} \le 10^9$ for all $i$), the current order of the cards’ rarity values. -----Output----- If the cards can be sorted by reversing exactly one contiguous subsequence of the list, then output the $1$-based start and end indices of such a subsequence. Otherwise, output “impossible”. If there are multiple valid solutions you may output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 10 13 19 19 15 14 20 Sample Output 1: 3 6 Sample Input 2: 6 9 1 8 2 7 3 Sample Output 2: impossible
