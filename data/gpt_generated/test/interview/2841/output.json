The goal of the game is to move your game piece from the start square to square $N$. You are given a deck of cards. Each card has a single color on it. A player moves to the nearest square after their current square with the color indicated by the drawn card. If there are no squares of the drawn color after a player s current square, that player s piece does not move and their turn ends. You need to find the smallest number of cards any one player would have to draw to complete the game.",
