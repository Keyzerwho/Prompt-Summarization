 You are given a board of size $N+1$ with $N$ squares of different colors. You are also given a deck of $N$ cards of different colors. You need to find the minimum number of cards required to complete the game. 
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 200000$) denoting the number of squares. The next $N$ lines each contain a single string $S_ i \in \{ \text {Blue}, \text {Orange}, \text {Pink}, \text {Green}, \text {Red}, \text {Yellow}\} $ representing the color of the $i^\text {th}$ square, starting with the first square on the board (not counting the start square). -----Output----- Output a single integer equal to the minimum number of draws required to move from the start square to square $N$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 Blue Orange Pink Green Red Yellow Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 12 Blue Orange Pink Green Red Yellow Yellow Red Green Pink Orange Blue Sample Output 2: 2
