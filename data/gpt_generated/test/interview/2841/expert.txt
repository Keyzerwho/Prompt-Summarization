 You are given a board of $N+1$ squares. The first square is a special start square, the remaining $N$ squares are colored blue, orange, pink, green, red, or yellow. The goal of the game is to move your game piece from the start square to square $N$. You are given a deck of cards. Each card has a single color on it. A player moves to the nearest square after their current square with the color indicated by the drawn card. If there are no squares of the drawn color after a player s current square, that player s piece does not move and their turn ends. You need to find the smallest number of cards any one player would have to draw to complete the game.
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 200000$) denoting the number of squares. The next $N$ lines each contain a single string $S_ i \in \{ \text {Blue}, \text {Orange}, \text {Pink}, \text {Green}, \text {Red}, \text {Yellow}\} $ representing the color of the $i^\text {th}$ square, starting with the first square on the board (not counting the start square). -----Output----- Output a single integer equal to the minimum number of draws required to move from the start square to square $N$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 Blue Orange Pink Green Red Yellow Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 12 Blue Orange Pink Green Red Yellow Yellow Red Green Pink Orange Blue Sample Output 2: 2
