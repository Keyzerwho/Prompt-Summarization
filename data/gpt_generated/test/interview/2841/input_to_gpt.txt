There are $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. For the one move you can choose any even value $c$ and divide by two all elements that equal $c$. For example, if $a=[6,8,12,6,3,12]$ and you choose $c=6$, and $a$ is transformed into $a=[3,8,12,3,3,12]$ after the move. You need to find the minimal number of moves for transforming $a$ to an array of only odd integers (each element shouldn't be divisible by $2$).

Dinesh is very fond of sweets recently his aunt Riya gifted him an array $a$ of sweets of size $N$. The ith sweet is of the type $a[i]$. His mother told him that he can choose one type of sweet in a day and eat at most 2 sweets of that type. Since he has to eat all the sweets as quickly as possible because his cousins are arriving. Find out the minimum number of days in which he can eat all the sweets gifted by his aunt Riya.

Yancy is designing a new board game called Colorland. The rules of Colorland are as follows:  - Colorland s board is a linear sequence of $N+1$ squares. The first square is a special start square, the remaining $N$ squares are colored blue, orange, pink, green, red, or yellow.  - The goal of Colorland is to move your game piece from the start square to square $N$.  - Players take turns drawing from a shuffled deck of cards. Each card has a single color on it. A player moves to the nearest square after their current square with the color indicated by the drawn card.  - If there are no squares of the drawn color after a player s current square, that player s piece does not move and their turn ends. Yancy is interested in the length of play required for different board layouts. She would like to know the smallest number of cards any one player would have to draw to complete the game. For instance, the board for Sample Input 3 is [Start, Blue, Orange, Pink, Green, Red, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow, Yellow]. The best first draw is Yellow which advances a player from Start to the $6^\text {th}$ square. From the $6^\text {th}$ square to the end, only a Yellow draw will advance the player. Therefore the smallest number of draws is $4$.
