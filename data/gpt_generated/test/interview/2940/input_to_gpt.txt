This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls $x = 0$). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices $0 \leq i < m$, such that $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \right\rfloor$ is odd. Tell her the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$. 
tl;dr: You have $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ where $a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given. You want to pick some dolls, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks. The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$.  Find the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$.

You are the boss of ACM (Association for Control over Minds), an upstanding company with a single goal of world domination. Yesterday, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear, and the birds were singing.  Another day, another world domination plan , you sang to yourself as you devised your next world domination plan involving the illusory mind control potions. There s only one insignificant problem you have to solve before you can execute this perfection of a plan: you don t know the correct recipe for the mind control potion. You asked the local Panda-breed brewmaster for the recipe, but unfortunately he didn t know either. Instead, he gave you the mysterious tome titled The Root of all Evil (written by Halim the White). You read the evil book under candle light, and wrote down all the potion recipes contained inside the book.  One of them must be the formula for the mind control potion, I m sure of it! , you said to yourself. You numbered these recipes from $1$ through $N$.  I just need to try concocting all of these recipes! , you hummed to yourself. Today, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear, and , anyway. You have purchased all the utensils and ingredients from the local grocery   onion, carrot, broom, vials, cauldrons, bat wings,  , all common grocery items. Now, you are ready to begin your experiments, but then you notice that some of the recipes share common ingredients! Unfortunately, you only bought one of each ingredient with you.  Oh no! What should I do now ! , you panicked.  I ll just create some of the potions today, and do the remaining ones later. , you resolved. You consider all your recipes one by one in order by their number from recipe $1$ through recipe $N$. For each recipe, if you are not able to concoct this potion (explained in the next paragraph), you skip this recipe, and consider the next one, if any. Otherwise, even though it may cause some of the next potions to no longer be concoctable, you concoct this recipe. Thus, whether to concoct a potion is not a choice. It s simply determined by whether it is possible or not to do so when you consider the potion. In order to concoct a potion, you first prepare a new empty cauldron (you managed to procure an infinite number of cauldrons from the grocery store). Then, you combine all of the ingredients required for this potion and nothing else in this cauldron (that is, the cauldron cannot contain any ingredients not listed in the recipe). For the ingredients that have not been used for any of the previous potions that you ve decided to concoct, you can simply put it into this cauldron. You can also pour the entire content of the cauldron used for one of your previous concoctions into this cauldron, thus mixing in all of the ingredients contained inside the cauldron (since you pour all of the content of the cauldron, this previous concoction can no longer be used for any of your next concoctions). Finally, you stir this cauldron with your broom and take a vial of the concoction to test on your minions later. The remaining concoction remains in this cauldron, and can be poured into another cauldron later.  What is the number of recipes you will concoct this way today  , you asked yourself.
