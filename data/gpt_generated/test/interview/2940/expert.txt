 You are the boss of ACM (Association for Control over Minds), an upstanding company with a single goal of world domination. You have purchased all the utensils and ingredients from the local grocery   onion, carrot, broom, vials, cauldrons, bat wings,  , all common grocery items. Now, you are ready to begin your experiments, but then you notice that some of the recipes share common ingredients! Unfortunately, you only bought one of each ingredient with you. Oh no! What should I do now ! , you panicked. I ll just create some of the potions today, and do the remaining ones later. You consider all your recipes one by one in order by their number from recipe $1$ through recipe $N$. For each recipe, if you are not able to concoct this potion (explained in the next paragraph), you skip this recipe, and consider the next one, if any. Otherwise, even though it may cause some of the next potions to no longer be concoctable, you concoct this recipe. Thus, whether to concoct a potion is not a choice. It s simply determined by whether it is possible or not to do so when you consider the potion. In order to concoct a potion, you first prepare a new empty cauldron (you managed to procure an infinite number of cauldrons from the grocery store). Then, you combine all of the ingredients required for this potion and nothing else in this cauldron (that is, the cauldron cannot contain any ingredients not listed in the recipe). For the ingredients that have not been used for any of the previous potions that you ve decided to concoct, you can simply put it into this cauldron. You can also
-----Input----- The first line contains a non-negative integer $2 \leq N \leq 200000$, giving the total number of recipes you have. Thereafter follow $N$ lines, the $i$-th line describes recipe number $i$. Each of these lines is a single space separated list of integers. Each of these lines begins with an integer $1 \leq M$, denoting the number of ingredients required to make this recipe. Then, $M$ integers follow, describing the required ingredients. The ingredients are identified by integers between $0$ and $500000$, inclusively, with different integers denoting different ingredients. For each recipe, all of its ingredients will be distinct. The sum of $M$ over all recipes will be no greater than $500000$. -----Output----- Print the number of recipes you will concoct.Sample Data Explanation In the first example, the first potion can be concocted, since both ingredients were not used so far. Thus, you will concoct this potion. The second potion will also be concocted for the same reason. The third potion cannot be concocted, since ingredient $1$ is no longer present, and is inside a cauldron mixed with another ingredient not present in the recipe. The fourth potion can be concocted by pouring the content of the cauldrons used for the first and second concoctions, and then adding ingredient $5$, which has remained unused so far. The last potion cannot be concocted, since the content of the cauldron for the first potion has all been poured when making the fourth potion and thus is now mixed with other ingredients not present in the recipe. For the second example, since the first potion can be concocted, it has to be concocted. Thus, the second and third potions can no longer be concocted. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 2 1 2 2 3 4 2 1 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 2 1 2 Sample Output: 3
