You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges. You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct all undirected edges. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 

Lea runs into a lot of words in her life. A lot of them she finds unpleasant. To compensate for that she started making up pleasant words. Lea makes up new words by writing a nice looking string of characters on a piece of paper. She than erases a few of the most nasty looking characters and replaces them with underscores  _ . After that she tries to replace the underscores with more acceptable characters trying to form a pleasant word. Lea considers words pleasant if they do not contain $3$ sequential vowels, $3$ sequential consonants and contain at least one letter  L . In Croatian, the vowels are the letters A, E, I, O, and U only. All other lettters are consonants.
