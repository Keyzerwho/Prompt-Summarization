Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0. 
tl;dr: You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0. 

You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges. You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct all undirected edges. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 

Ms. E.T. came from planet Hex. She has 8 fingers in each hand which makes her count in hexadecimal way. When she meets you, she tells you that she came from 7E light years from the planet Earth. You see she means that it is 126 light years far away and she is telling you the numbers in hexadecimal. Now, you are in trouble to understand what those numbers really mean. Therefore, you have to convert the hexadecimal numbers to decimals. 
tl;dr: Write the code to convert the hexadecimal number into its corresponding decimal value. 

Lea runs into a lot of words in her life. A lot of them she finds unpleasant. To compensate for that she started making up pleasant words. Lea makes up new words by writing a nice looking string of characters on a piece of paper. She than erases a few of the most nasty looking characters and replaces them with underscores  _ . After that she tries to replace the underscores with more acceptable characters trying to form a pleasant word. Lea considers words pleasant if they do not contain $3$ sequential vowels, $3$ sequential consonants and contain at least one letter  L . In Croatian, the vowels are the letters A, E, I, O, and U only. All other lettters are consonants. 
tl;dr:
