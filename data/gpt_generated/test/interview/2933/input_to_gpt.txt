Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012 N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N   (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches. For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows: Match Team A Team B Ad revenue 1 1 2 7  2 1 3 0  3 1 4 2  4 2 3 7  5 2 4 5  6 3 4 2  Thus the total advertising revenue is 23. 
tl;dr: You are given N teams which can play with each exactly one time.Each team is assigned a strength as a positive integer.Find the sum of all the absolute difference between the strengths of all the possible two matches. 

For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000. 
tl;dr: Given a number, determine how many positive integers less than or equal to the number are odd but not prime. Assume it is an integer between 1 and 10000. 

Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus is training for a contest where it will have to lift $1000$ kg. Wallace has some weight plates lying around, possibly of different weights, and its goal is to add some of the plates to a bar so that it can train with a weight as close as possible to $1000$ kg. In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to $1000$ (e.g. $998$ and $1002$), Wallace will pick the greater one (in this case $1002$). Help Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus and tell it which weight it will have to lift.
