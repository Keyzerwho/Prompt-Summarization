 Given a room represented by a grid, and a laser and sensor, find the best place to place a mirror to reflect the laser to the sensor. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers: $n$, the size of the room, $c$, the column number of the laser ($1\leq c\leq n$), and $r$, the row number of the sensor ($1\leq r\leq n$). This is followed by $n$ lines, each containing $n$ characters separated by spaces. The character . represents an empty space, the character \ represents a mirror oriented NW/SE and the character / represents a mirror oriented NE/SW. You may assume $1\leq n\leq 2000$ and $1\leq r,c\leq n$. -----Output----- The output should consist of the string YES if the laser can be made to hit the sensor with the addition of at most one mirror, or the string NO otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 2 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . \ . . . \ . . . . . . . .
