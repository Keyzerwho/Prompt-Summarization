 You have a laser and a sensor. The laser is in the northern wall pointing south, and the sensor is mounted on the eastern wall, such that the laser must hit it from the west. You have a number of mirrors, and you want to place them such that the laser will reach the sensor (as long as no one is in its way). 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers: $n$, the size of the room, $c$, the column number of the laser ($1\leq c\leq n$), and $r$, the row number of the sensor ($1\leq r\leq n$). This is followed by $n$ lines, each containing $n$ characters separated by spaces. The character . represents an empty space, the character \ represents a mirror oriented NW/SE and the character / represents a mirror oriented NE/SW. You may assume $1\leq n\leq 2000$ and $1\leq r,c\leq n$. -----Output----- The output should consist of the string YES if the laser can be made to hit the sensor with the addition of at most one mirror, or the string NO otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 2 3 . . . . . . . . . . . . \ . . . \ . . . . . . . .
