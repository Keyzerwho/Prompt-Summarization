Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 5. If any of the permutations is divisible by 5 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: If any of the permutations of a given number  N is divisible by 5, then print 1 else print 0. 

You are given a prime number $p$, $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, and an integer $k$.  Find the number of pairs of indexes $(i, j)$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$) for which $(a_i + a_j)(a_i^2 + a_j^2) \equiv k \bmod p$.

We have a permutation of the integers from 1 through N, p_1, p_2, .., p_N. We also have M pairs of two integers between 1 and N (inclusive), represented as (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), .., (x_M,y_M). AtCoDeer the deer is going to perform the following operation on p as many times as desired so that the number of i (1   i   N) such that p_i = i is maximized:  - Choose j such that 1   j   M, and swap p_{x_j} and p_{y_j}. Find the maximum possible number of i such that p_i = i after operations. -----Constraints-----  - 2   N   10^5  - 1   M   10^5  - p is a permutation of integers from 1 through N.  - 1   x_j,y_j   N  - x_j   y_j  - If i   j, \{x_i,y_i\}   \{x_j,y_j\}.  - All values in input are integers.

Nathaniel collects rare gems and minerals, and has decided he has to protect his valuable collection from thieves. He is installing an electric eye system, in which he shines a laser into the room with his collection, and the laser will hit a sensor as long as no one steps in a spot that the laser crosses. Unfortunately, he spent most of his money on his collection, so he has only one laser and one sensor, and some mirrors. He has installed the mirrors at various locations in the room, at $45$ degree angles to the walls. At the point you have been called in to help, he has only one more mirror left to install, and he wants to know if there is any way to place it such that the laser will reach the sensor (as long as no one is in its way). We will assume that the room is always square, the laser is always in the northern wall pointing south, and the sensor is mounted on the eastern wall, such that the laser must hit it from the west. We will also assume that the interior of the room can be represented by a grid, and that all mirrors (including the one to be added) are placed at the center of grid cells, at $45$ degrees with respect to the grid axis, and that the laser and sensor are at the center of their respective column/row of the grid.
