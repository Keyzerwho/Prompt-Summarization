Naturally the zoo is connected, so you can reach any area of the zoo from any other area using the roads. Our child is very smart. Imagine the child want to go from area p to area q. Firstly he considers all the simple routes from p to q. For each route the child writes down the number, that is equal to the minimum number of animals among the route areas. Let's denote the largest of the written numbers as f(p, q). Finally, the child chooses one of the routes for which he writes down the value f(p, q). After the child has visited the zoo, he thinks about the question: what is the average value of f(p, q) for all pairs p, q (p   q)  Can you answer his question? ",
