The Jones Trucking Company tracks the location of each of its trucks on a grid similar to an (x, y) plane. The home office is at the location (0, 0). Read the coordinates of truck A and the coordinates of truck B and determine which is closer to the office. 
tl;dr: Print the point name which is closer to point P(0,0) by calculating distance from other given points. 

## A square of squares You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks! However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain  Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a _perfect square_. ## Task Given an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number): > In mathematics, a __square number__ or __perfect square__ is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. The tests will _always_ use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages. ### 
tl;dr: Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number. 

Gildong recently learned how to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in $O(n\log{n})$ time for a sequence of length $n$. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn't find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he's going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, to test his code with your output. The quiz is as follows. Gildong provides a string of length $n-1$, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element. He wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible.

Of course our child likes walking in a zoo. The zoo has n areas, that are numbered from 1 to n. The i-th area contains a_{i} animals in it. Also there are m roads in the zoo, and each road connects two distinct areas. Naturally the zoo is connected, so you can reach any area of the zoo from any other area using the roads. Our child is very smart. Imagine the child want to go from area p to area q. Firstly he considers all the simple routes from p to q. For each route the child writes down the number, that is equal to the minimum number of animals among the route areas. Let's denote the largest of the written numbers as f(p, q). Finally, the child chooses one of the routes for which he writes down the value f(p, q). After the child has visited the zoo, he thinks about the question: what is the average value of f(p, q) for all pairs p, q (p   q)  Can you answer his question
