This is a peculiar functioning setup. Two Tanks are separated from each other by a wall .There is a pipe in the wall which connects  both tanks  which allows flow of water between them . Due to this ,there is change in temperature of both tanks , every minute temperature of Tank with larger temperature among two decreases by one and temperature of Tank  with smaller temperature among two increases by two until equilibrium is reached , But there is a problem . The pipe can't control this flow of water if there is Non-equilibrium (inequality of temperature  on  both sides )  even after $m$ minutes and the pipe will burst after it , your task is to predict whether the pipe will burst or not . 
tl;dr: Given numbers $m$, $Tc$, $Th$.  If the difference between $Tc$ and $Th$ is not divisible by $3$, return "Yes". Else if the differnce divided by $3$ is more than $m$ return "Yes".  Else return "No". 

Check if given chord is minor or major. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ There is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music. notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] Note that e. g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1.  
tl;dr: Given a string, determine if given string is minor or major or not a chord. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] 

Mirko and Slavko are playing a new game,  Trojke  (Triplets, in English). First they use a chalk to draw an $N \times N$ square grid on the road. Then they write letters into some of the squares. No letter is written more than once in the grid. The game consists of trying to find three letters on a line as fast as possible. Three letters are considered to be on the same line if there is a line going through the centre of each of the three squares. After a while it gets harder to find new triplets. Mirko and Slavko need a program that counts all the triplets, so that they know if the game is over or they need to search further.
