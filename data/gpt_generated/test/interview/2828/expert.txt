 Given an array of words and an array of numbers, encrypt the words using a substitution cypher and sort them lexicographically. Print the key that was used to encrypt the words. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 100$). Each of the following $N$ lines contains a single word that consists of at most $100$ lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The words will be mutually distinct. The last line contains $N$ integers – the elements of array $A$. -----Output----- In the case when a solution doesn’t exist, output “NE”. Otherwise, output “DA” in the first line, and in the second line output a word consisting of $26$ different letters of the English alphabet – the key for the substitution cipher. If multiple solutions exist, output any. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 2 ab bc 2 1 Sample Output 1: DA bacdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Sample Input 2: 3 abc bcd add 1 2 3 Sample Output 2: NE
