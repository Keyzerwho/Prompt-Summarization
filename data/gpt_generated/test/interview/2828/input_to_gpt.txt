Farmer Bob have a big farm, where he growths chickens, rabbits and cows. It is very difficult to count the number of animals for each type manually, so he diceded to buy a system to do it. But he bought a cheap system that can count only total number of heads, total number of legs and total number of horns of animals on the farm. Help Bob to figure out how many chickens, rabbits and cows does he have  All chickens have 2 legs, 1 head and no horns; all rabbits have 4 legs, 1 head and no horns; all cows have 4 legs, 1 head and 2 horns. Your task is to write a function  ```Python get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) ``` ```Csharp Dictionary get_animals_count(int legs_number, int heads_number, int horns_number) ``` , which returns a dictionary  ```python {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} ```  ```Csharp new Dictionary(){{"rabbits", rabbits_count},{"chickens", chickens_count},{"cows", cows_count}} ``` Parameters `legs_number, heads_number, horns_number` are integer, all tests have valid input. 
tl;dr: Your task is to write a function get_animals_count(legs_number, heads_number, horns_number) which returns a dictionary {"rabbits" : rabbits_count, "chickens" : chickens_count, "cows" : cows_count} 

There are N people, conveniently numbered 1 through N. We want to divide them into some number of groups, under the following two conditions:  - Every group contains between A and B people, inclusive.  - Let F_i be the number of the groups containing exactly i people. Then, for all i, either F_i=0 or C F_i D holds. Find the number of these ways to divide the people into groups. Here, two ways to divide them into groups is considered different if and only if there exists two people such that they belong to the same group in exactly one of the two ways. Since the number of these ways can be extremely large, print the count modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 1 N 10^3  - 1 A B N  - 1 C D N

# A History Lesson Soundex is an interesting phonetic algorithm developed nearly 100 years ago for indexing names as they are pronounced in English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex # Preface I first read about Soundex over 30 years ago. At the time it seemed to me almost  like  A.I. that you could just type in somebody's name the way it sounded and there was still a pretty good chance it could match the correct person record. That was about the same year as the first "Terminator" movie so it was easy for me to put 2 and 2 together and conclude that Arnie must have had some kind of futuristic Soundex chip in his titanium skull helping him to locate ```Serah Coner```... or was it ```Sarh Connor```... or maybe ```Sayra Cunnarr```... :-) # Task In this Kata you will encode strings using a Soundex variation called "American Soundex" using the following (case insensitive) steps: * Save the first letter. Remove all occurrences of ```h``` and ```w``` except first letter. * Replace all consonants (include the first letter) with digits as follows:  * ```b```, ```f```, ```p```, ```v``` = 1  * ```c```, ```g```, ```j```, ```k```, ```q```, ```s```, ```x```, ```z``` = 2  * ```d```, ```t``` = 3  * ```l``` = 4  * ```m```, ```n``` = 5  * ```r``` = 6 * Replace all adjacent same digits with one digit. * Remove all occurrences of ```a```, ```e```, ```i```, ```o```, ```u```, ```y``` except first letter. * If first symbol is a digit replace it with letter saved on step 1. * Append 3 zeros if result contains less than 3 digits. Remove all except first letter and 3 digits after it ## Input A space separated string of one or more names. E.g. ```Sarah Connor``` ## Output Space separated string of equivalent Soundex codes (the first character of each code must be uppercase). E.g. ```S600 C560``

Mirko has an array of $N$ different words that he wants to encrypt using a substitution cypher. We encrypt the text using a substitution cypher by first choosing a key   a permutation of the English alphabet. Then we replace all occurrences of letter  a  with the first letter of the key, all occurrences of letter  b  with the second letter of the key, and so on until letter  z . Besides the words, Mirko has an array $A$ consisting of numbers from $1$ to $N$ given in a certain order (in other words, array $A$ is a permutation of numbers from $1$ to $N$). Mirko wants to pick a key such that the array of words after encrypting and lexicographic sorting corresponds to array $A$. More precisely, he wants the word initially located at $A_ i$ to be at location $i$ after encryption and sorting. Let s recall that the lexicographic word order is the order in which the words appear in the dictionary. If we are comparing two words, going from left to right, we search for the first position in both words where the letters differ and, based on that, we determine which word is lexicographically smaller. If word $X$ is the beginning of the word $Y$, then word $X$ is lexicographically smaller than word $Y$. Mirko is currently not in the mood for encrypting, so he kindly asks you to do it for him.
