You both want as much dark chocolate as possible, while simultaneously obtaining as little white chocolate as possible. Every dark piece of chocolate you obtain gives you $1$ meaningless unit of happiness, while a white piece lowers your happiness by $1$ meaningless unit (and the same holds for your sister). Now, while you love your sister very much, there is always heavy competition between siblings, so your goal is to maximize the difference of your obtained happiness and her obtained happiness (while she tries to do the opposite, obviously).
