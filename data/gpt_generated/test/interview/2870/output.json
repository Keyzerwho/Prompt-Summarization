However, as you gobbled up the large majority last time, your parents have invented a game to keep things fair (and to keep you occupied while they hide all the other chocolate). To keep things interesting, they have given you a rectangular piece of chocolate, which consists of little squares of both dark chocolate and white chocolate in a chessboard pattern. While you and your sister both love dark chocolate, you hate white chocolate! So, both you and your sister want as much dark chocolate as possible, while simultaneously obtaining as little white chocolate as possible. Every dark piece of chocolate you obtain gives you $1$ meaningless unit of happiness, while a white piece lowers your happiness by $1$ meaningless unit (and the same holds for your sister). Now, while you love your sister very much, there is always heavy competition between siblings, so your goal is to maximize the difference of your obtained happiness and her obtained happiness (while she tries to do the opposite, obviously).  The game works as follows. Your parents place a $p \\times q$-rectangle of the aforementioned mixed chocolate on a table. You are situated on the west side of the table and your sister on the south side. The side of length $p$ is parallel to the north-south line, while the side of length $q$ is parallel to the east-west line. Furthermore, the north-west square is made of dark chocolate. Then, starting with yourself, you take turns breaking off blocks of chocolate (which you can keep). You can break off any positive number of entire columns from the west side, while your",
