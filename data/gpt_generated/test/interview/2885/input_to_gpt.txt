Chef loves triangles. But the chef is poor at maths. Given three random lengths Chef wants to find if the three sides form a right-angled triangle or not. Can you help Chef in this endeavour  
tl;dr: Given lengths $A,B and C$ return YES if they can form a right angled triangle, NO otherwise. 

Let us define two functions f and g on positive integer numbers.  $f(n) = \text{product of non-zero digits of} n$ $g(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}{n} & {\text{if} n < 10} \\{g(f(n))} & {\text{otherwise}} \end{array} \right.$  You need to process Q queries. In each query, you will be given three integers l, r and k. You need to print the number of integers x between l and r inclusive, such that g(x) = k.

You have the `radius` of a circle with the center in point `(0,0)`. Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where `(x,y)` - the cartesian coordinates of the points - are `integers`. 
tl;dr: You have the radius of a circle with the center in point (0,0). Write a function that calculates the number of points in the circle where (x,y) are integers.  0 <= radius <= 1000. 

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary). You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
