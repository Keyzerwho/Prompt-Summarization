Sonya was unable to think of a story for this problem, so here comes the formal description. You are given the array containing n positive integers. At one turn you can pick any element and increase or decrease it by 1. The goal is the make the array strictly increasing by making the minimum possible number of operations. You are allowed to change elements in any way, they can become negative or equal to 0.

The USA Construction Operation (USACO) recently ordered Farmer John to arrange a row of $n$ haybale piles on the farm. The $i$-th pile contains $a_i$ haybales.  However, Farmer John has just left for vacation, leaving Bessie all on her own. Every day, Bessie the naughty cow can choose to move one haybale in any pile to an adjacent pile. Formally, in one day she can choose any two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$) such that $|i-j|=1$ and $a_i>0$ and apply $a_i = a_i - 1$, $a_j = a_j + 1$. She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy. Bessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile $1$ (i.e. to maximize $a_1$), and she only has $d$ days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile $1$ if she acts optimally! 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 

# Story You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee. Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on... But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work. To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in. # Kata Task Given the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted. # 
tl;dr: # Task Given the start and end numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all digits from start number to end number. # 

Your friend Claire has dragged you along to a speedcubing event that is happening in Eindhoven. These events are all about solving the Rubik s cube and similar twisty puzzles as quickly as possible. The attendants of the event can enter into various competitions based on the type and size of the puzzle, and there are even special competitions where the puzzles need to be solved one-handed or blindfolded.  Claire is competing in the most popular competition: speedsolving the $3\times 3\times 3$ Rubik s cube, pictured on the right. Each contestant needs to solve the cube five times, each time with a different random scramble. After all solves are completed, the best and the worst times are discarded and the final score is the average of the remaining three times. The contestant with the smallest final score wins. Claire has done well in the competition so far and is among the contenders for the overall victory. All the other contestants have already finished their five solves, but Claire has one solve remaining. By looking at the final scores of the other contestants, she has deduced her own target final score. As long as her final score is less than or equal to this target score, she will be declared the overall winner. Is it possible for her to win the competition, and if so, what is the worst time she can have on her last solve in order to do so
