-----General Statement:----- Given the actual high and low temperatures for the day and the normal high and low temperatures for that day, calculate the average difference from normal. 
tl;dr: Determine the average of the difference of the high temperatures and the difference of the low temperatures. 

Sasha is taking part in a programming competition. In one of the problems she should check if some rooted trees are isomorphic or not. She has never seen this problem before, but, being an experienced participant, she guessed that she should match trees to some sequences and then compare these sequences instead of trees. Sasha wants to match each tree with a sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{h}, where h is the height of the tree, and a_{i} equals to the number of vertices that are at distance of i edges from root.  Unfortunately, this time Sasha's intuition was wrong, and there could be several trees matching the same sequence. To show it, you need to write a program that, given the sequence a_{i}, builds two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree. Two rooted trees are isomorphic, if you can reenumerate the vertices of the first one in such a way, that the index of the root becomes equal the index of the root of the second tree, and these two trees become equal. The height of a rooted tree is the maximum number of edges on a path from the root to any other vertex. 
tl;dr: You need to write a program that, given the sequence a_{i}, build two non-isomorphic rooted trees that match that sequence, or determines that there is only one such tree. 

The boardgame Chaos is an exotic variant of Chess, played by two players in alternating turns on an $n\times n$ playing board. All pieces have the same set of $n$ valid moves which are agreed on ahead of the game.  In a single turn a player can pick exactly one of their pieces and perform one of the following actions:  - Perform up to two valid moves using the chosen piece, capturing any piece that the chosen piece lands on along the way.  - Teleport the chosen piece to any cell on the board that is not already occupied by another piece.  - Leave the chosen piece untouched in its current cell. Having recently discovered Chaos, Alice and Bob are currently in the endgame of a very exciting match. Each player has a single piece left on the board and there are only two turns left, with Alice going next. Having analysed the situation, she realises that the only way she can win is to capture Bob s piece in her turn. If that is not possible, Alice may be able to force a tie if she can teleport her piece to a cell that Bob cannot capture in his turn. Otherwise Bob will be able to win by capturing Alice s piece, no matter what she does in her turn. Help Alice determine her optimal outcome.
