When particle $i$ hits particle $j$, particle $j$ will start moving in the direction perpendicular to the tangent at the point of the contact, away from particle $i$. Particle $i$ will cease to exist and be converted to radiation. A moving particle that does not hit another will continue moving indefinitely. There are a number of possible scenarios your simulator should identify: \n- particle $1$ hits particle $2$, which in turns hits particle $3$; \n- particle $1$ hits particle $3$, which in turns hits particle $2$; \n- particle $1$ hits particle $2$, which moves indefinitely; \n- particle $1$ hits particle $3$, which moves indefinitely; \n- particle $1$ moves indefinitely.",
