 You are given the initial positions of three particles. They are confined to an infinite plane. All particles have the same radius. When two particles collide, the second particle will move away from the first one in a direction perpendicular to the tangent at the point of the contact. The first particle will cease to exist and be converted to radiation. There are a number of possible scenarios your simulator should identify: 
-----Input----- The input contains four lines. The first three lines each contains two integers $x_ i$ and $y_ i$ ($|x_ i|,|y_ i| \leq 1000$), describing particles $1$, $2$, and $3$ in this order. The fourth line contains three integers $x_ v$, $y_ v$, and $r$ ($|x_ v|, |y_ v| \leq 1000$, $0 < r \leq 50$). You may assume that no two particles touch or overlap initially, and that the distance between the centers of particles $2$ and $3$ is greater than $4r$. -----Output----- Output a single integer giving the number ($1$â€“$5$) identifying the scenarios described above. Although you should take care of your calculations, it is guaranteed that the outcome would not change if the initial vector $(x_ v,y_ v)$ is rotated by one degree either way. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 0 0 50 45 91 50 42 50 10 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 0 0 50 50 141 50 41 50 10 Sample Output 2: 3
