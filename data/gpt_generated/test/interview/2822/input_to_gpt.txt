This is an easier version of the next problem. The difference is only in constraints. You are given a rectangular $n \times m$ matrix $a$. In one move you can choose any column and cyclically shift elements in this column. You can perform this operation as many times as you want (possibly zero). You can perform this operation to a column multiple times. After you are done with cyclical shifts, you compute for every row the maximal value in it. Suppose that for $i$-th row it is equal $r_i$. What is the maximal possible value of $r_1+r_2+\ldots+r_n$

Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between). For example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     3    / \   9  20     /  \    15   7 return its zigzag level order traversal as: [   [3],   [20,9],   [15,7]

Igor the analyst has adopted n little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. Igor wants to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. He wants to make sure that all n pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area   [Image] Illustration to the first example.

You are playing hide-and-go-seek in a forest with Belle. The forest has one tree at each of the positive integer lattice points. That is, there is a tree at every point $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers. You may consider each tree as a point. A logging company has cut down all of the trees in some axis-aligned rectangle, including those on the boundary of the rectangle. You are standing at $(0,0)$ and Belle is standing at $(x_ b,y_ b)$. You can see Belle if and only if there is no tree blocking your line of sight to Belle. If there is a tree at $(x_ b,y_ b)$, Belle will make it easier for you to find her by standing on the side of the tree facing your location. For example, suppose that Belle is standing at $(2,6)$. If the trees in the rectangle with corners at $(1,1)$ and $(5,4)$ are cut down (blue rectangle in figure), then you can see Belle. However, if the rectangle was at $(3,5)$ and $(5,7)$ (red rectangle in figure), then the tree at $(1,3)$ would be in the way. Given the rectangle and Belle s location, can you see her
