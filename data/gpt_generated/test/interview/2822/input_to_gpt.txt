Dreamoon likes sequences very much. So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS:  You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, satisfying the following constraints:  The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$  Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$, where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or (xor). After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo $m$. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, with constraints. The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$   Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$,  where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or.  After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  You need to find the answer modulo $m$. 

The sequence of $m$ integers is called the permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $m$ exactly once. The number $m$ is called the length of the permutation. Dreamoon has two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$ of non-zero lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. Now Dreamoon concatenates these two permutations into another sequence $a$ of length $l_1 + l_2$. First $l_1$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_1$ and next $l_2$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_2$.  You are given the sequence $a$, and you need to find two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$. If there are several possible ways to restore them, you should find all of them. (Note that it is also possible that there will be no ways.)

You are playing hide-and-go-seek in a forest with Belle. The forest has one tree at each of the positive integer lattice points. That is, there is a tree at every point $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers. You may consider each tree as a point. A logging company has cut down all of the trees in some axis-aligned rectangle, including those on the boundary of the rectangle. You are standing at $(0,0)$ and Belle is standing at $(x_ b,y_ b)$. You can see Belle if and only if there is no tree blocking your line of sight to Belle. If there is a tree at $(x_ b,y_ b)$, Belle will make it easier for you to find her by standing on the side of the tree facing your location. For example, suppose that Belle is standing at $(2,6)$. If the trees in the rectangle with corners at $(1,1)$ and $(5,4)$ are cut down (blue rectangle in figure), then you can see Belle. However, if the rectangle was at $(3,5)$ and $(5,7)$ (red rectangle in figure), then the tree at $(1,3)$ would be in the way. Given the rectangle and Belle s location, can you see her
