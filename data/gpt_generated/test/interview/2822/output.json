That is, there is a tree at every point $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers. You may consider each tree as a point. A logging company has cut down all of the trees in some axis-aligned rectangle, including those on the boundary of the rectangle. You are standing at $(0,0)$ and Belle is standing at $(x_ b,y_ b)$. You can see Belle if and only if there is no tree blocking your line of sight to Belle. If there is a tree at $(x_ b,y_ b)$, Belle will make it easier for you to find her by standing on the side of the tree facing your location. For example, suppose that Belle is standing at $(2,6)$. If the trees in the rectangle with corners at $(1,1)$ and $(5,4)$ are cut down (blue rectangle in figure), then you can see Belle. However, if the rectangle was at $(3,5)$ and $(5,7)$ (red rectangle in figure), then the tree at $(1,3)$ would be in the way. Given the rectangle and Belle s location, can you see her ",
