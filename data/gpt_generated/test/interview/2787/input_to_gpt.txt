There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string.  
tl;dr: Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string. Consecutive integers should be treated as a single number and all the numbers should be treaded as positive integer. If no number was given in the string, it should return 0. 

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Now elections are held in Berland and you want to win them. More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you. There are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free. Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \rightarrow {1, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$. Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.

At one of the many climate protests, Skylar fell in love with a fellow environmental activist. Unfortunately, the two young lovers live on opposite sides of the planet and long distance travel is only practical by (gasp) air. Skylar had scolded friends and family for flying, heavily handing out the recent Swedish export flygskam (verbatim translation: flight shame). But alas, the things we do for love! Now they want your help to calculate the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will accumulate on a one-way trip across the globe.  To calculate the best route you models the planet as a perfect sphere and assumes that all flights fly at the distance $6381$ km from the center of the earth. The amount of shame for a single point-to-point flight is calculated as the distance between the airports in km, plus a take-off and landing penalty of $100$, that is, two airports with the flight distance $1000$ km will result in $1100$ shame. -----Latitude and longitude----- The positions of the airports are given as the latitude and longitude in (decimal) degrees. The latitude of a point $P$ on the earths surface is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line passing through $P$ and the center of the earth. The equator has latitude $0^\circ $, points north of the equator has positive values and points south of the equator has negative values, the North Pole has latitude $90^\circ $ and the South Pole latitude $-90 ^\circ $. Half circles that run from the North to the South pole are called meridians. The zero meridian runs through Greenwich. The longitude of a point $Q$ is the angle between the zero meridian plane and the line that run through $Q$ and the center of the earth, with values from $- 180^\circ $ to $+180^\circ $, with positive values east of Greenwich.
