 Given the latitude and longitude of two airports, calculate the minimum amount of shame Skylar will accumulate on a one-way trip across the globe.
-----Input----- Input starts with one line with two integers $1 \leq N \leq 10000$, the number of airports and $1 \leq M \leq 100000$, the number of two-way flight routes. The second line has two strings $S$ and $T$, Skylar’s start position and Skylar’s target position. Then follows $N$ lines, each starts with a three letter (uppercase) airport code, followed by two real values numbers, the latitude and longitude in degrees. Then follows $M$ lines, each with two strings $a$ and $b$, the airports with a two-way flight connection. All flight airports have unique names and all connections are between existing airports. -----Output----- Output a real value with the minimum amount of flygskam Skylar will obtain on a one-way trip. If the target is unreachable and Skylar will be forever alone, output -1. Answers within a relative or absolute error of $10^{-6}$ will be accepted. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 4 ARN SCR ARN 59.6467921 17.9370443 SCR 61.156603 12.837360 CPH 55.618023 12.650763 OSL 60.197646 11.100008 ARN OSL ARN CPH SCR OSL OSL CPH Sample Output 1: 729.09706162045 Sample Input 2: 2 1 LAX AKL AKL -37.006131 174.783781 LAX 33.941589 -118.408531 LAX AKL Sample Output 2: 10603.3297338597
