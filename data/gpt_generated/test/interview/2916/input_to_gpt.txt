You are given two positive integers N and K. How many multisets of rational numbers satisfy all of the following conditions   - The multiset has exactly N elements and the sum of them is equal to K.  - Each element of the multiset is one of 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots. In other words, each element can be represented as \frac{1}{2^i}\ (i = 0,1,\dots). The answer may be large, so print it modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 3000  - All values in input are integers.

Check if given chord is minor or major. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic minor/major chord have three elements. 2. Chord is minor when interval between first and second element equals 3 and between second and third -> 4. 3. Chord is major when interval between first and second element equals 4 and between second and third -> 3. 4. In minor/major chord interval between first and third element equals... 7. _______________________________________________________________ There is a preloaded list of the 12 notes of a chromatic scale built on C. This means that there are (almost) all allowed note' s names in music. notes =  ['C', ['C#', 'Db'], 'D', ['D#', 'Eb'], 'E', 'F', ['F#', 'Gb'], 'G', ['G#', 'Ab'], 'A', ['A#', 'Bb'], 'B'] Note that e. g. 'C#' - 'C' = 1, 'C' - 'C#' = 1, 'Db' - 'C' = 1 and 'B' - 'C' = 1.  
tl;dr: Given a string, determine if given string is minor or major or not a chord. _____________________________________________________________ Rules: 1. Basic chord have three elements. 2.

Trouble has come to the remote group of islands known as Insumulia. Due to an unfortunate combination of over-consumption, natural climate variations, and generally difficult conditions, the island of Incunabula has run out of trees. Because several other Insumulian islands depended on trees from Incunabula through trade, its collapse will have repercussions all over Insumulia. In this problem, we ll simulate a (highly oversimplified) model of the situation to determine the effects of the collapse of Incunabula.  We model the situation as follows. Each island has a threshold $T_ i$ on the amount of incoming goods (for simplicity we assume that there is only a single commodity of goods) it needs to receive per lunar cycle in order for the society of the island to sustain itself. If the amount of incoming goods drops below the threshold, society on the island will collapse and die out, and the island will no longer provide goods to other islands, thereby potentially causing them to collapse as well. Each island provides some amount of goods to a number of other islands. If an island collapses, we assume that goods that would have been delivered to that island is effectively lost; it does not get redistributed and delivered to other islands instead. Also, once an island dies out it is not repopulated (until possibly long after the ongoing collapses have finished). Your job is to write a program to compute the number of islands that survive after the potential chain reaction of collapses that is caused by the collapse of Incunabula.
