 You are given a list of islands and their threshold. You are also given a list of islands that depend on the island. Your job is to determine the number of islands that survive after the chain reaction of collapses.  
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100000$), the number of islands in Insumulia. Then follow $N$ lines, describing each island. The $i$’th such description starts with two integers $T_ i$, $K_ i$, where $0 \le T_ i \le 50000$ is the amount of goods the $i$’th island needs to receive in order to survive, and $0 \le K_ i \le N-1$ is the number of other islands the $i$’th islands receives goods from. The remainder of the description of the $i$’th island is a list of $K_ i$ pairs of integers. The $j$’th such pair, $S_{ij}$, $V_{ij}$, indicates that island $i$ receives $V_{ij}$ units of goods from island $S_{ij}$ each lunar cycle. You may assume that the $S_{ij}$’s are distinct and between $1$ and $N$ (inclusive), and that none of them equals $i$. The values $V_{ij}$ satisfy $1 \le V_{ij} \le 1000$ and their sum is at least $T_ i$. The sum of all the $K_ i$’s for all the $N$ islands is at most $500000$. Islands are numbered from $1$ to $N$, and Incunabula is island number $1$. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the number of islands surviving the collapses. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 0 0 25 3 1 10 3 10 4 10 10 1 2 10 10 1 2 10 Sample Output: 0
