You are given several queries. Each query consists of three integers $p$, $q$ and $b$. You need to answer whether the result of $p/q$ in notation with base $b$ is a finite fraction. A fraction in notation with base $b$ is finite if it contains finite number of numerals after the decimal point. It is also possible that a fraction has zero numerals after the decimal point. 
tl;dr: You are given several queries. Each query consists of three integers $p$, $q$ and $b$. You need to answer whether the result of $p/q$ in notation with base $b$ is a finite fraction or not. 

You are given two positive integers N and K. How many multisets of rational numbers satisfy all of the following conditions   - The multiset has exactly N elements and the sum of them is equal to K.  - Each element of the multiset is one of 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots. In other words, each element can be represented as \frac{1}{2^i}\ (i = 0,1,\dots). The answer may be large, so print it modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 3000  - All values in input are integers.

How many days are we represented in a foreign country  My colleagues make business trips to a foreign country. We must find the number of days our company is represented in a country. Every day that one or more colleagues are present in the country is a day that the company is represented. A single day cannot count for more than one day. Write a function that recieves a list of pairs and returns the number of days that the company is represented in the foreign country. The first number of the pair is the number of the day of arrival and the second number of the pair is the day of departure of someone who travels, i.e. 1 january is number 1 and 31 of december is 365.

A tennis match involves three people: two players and an umpire. Each of these has to come from a different country. There are $N$ countries, and the $i$th country has $a_ i$ tennis players and $b_ i$ umpires. (Nobody can be both a player and an umpire.) How many different tennis matches are possible  Two tennis matches are different if the sets of involved people are different.
