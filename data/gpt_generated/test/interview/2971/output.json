The extent to which one word rhymes with another depends on how similar they sound; but if they are too similar then they aren't considered a rhyme at all. Karim has a huge list of $N$ words and wants to determine the maximally rhyming pair of words. To that end he has introduced the concept of rhyme power: Given two words $S$ and $T$, their rhyme power $r(S,T)$ is defined as - $0$, if one word is a suffix of the other, - the length of their longest common suffix, otherwise. For instance, the rhyme power of fire and desire is $3$, because their longest common suffix ire has length $3$. In contrast, the rhyme power of impossible and possible is $0$, because possible is a suffix of impossible. Given Karim's list of $N$ words, your task is to find the maximum value of $r(S, T)$ over all pairs of words. ",
