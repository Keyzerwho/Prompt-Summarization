On a broken calculator that has a number showing on its display, we can perform two operations: Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or; Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display. Initially, the calculator is displaying the number X. Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number Y.   
tl;dr: You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   

Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012 N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N   (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches. For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows: Match Team A Team B Ad revenue 1 1 2 7  2 1 3 0  3 1 4 2  4 2 3 7  5 2 4 5  6 3 4 2  Thus the total advertising revenue is 23. 
tl;dr: You are given N teams which can play with each exactly one time.Each team is assigned a strength as a positive integer.Find the sum of all the absolute difference between the strengths of all the possible two matches. 

Rhymes are complicated. The extent to which one word rhymes with another depends on how similar they sound; but if they are too similar then they aren t considered a rhyme at all. Karim has a huge list of $N$ words and wants to determine the maximally rhyming pair of words. To that end he has introduced the concept of rhyme power: Given two words $S$ and $T$, their rhyme power $r(S,T)$ is defined as  - $0$, if one word is a suffix of the other,  - the length of their longest common suffix, otherwise. For instance, the rhyme power of  fire  and  desire  is $3$, because their longest common suffix  ire  has length $3$. In contrast, the rhyme power of  impossible  and  possible  is $0$, because  possible  is a suffix of  impossible . Given Karim s list of $N$ words, your task is to find the maximum value of $r(S, T)$ over all pairs of words.
