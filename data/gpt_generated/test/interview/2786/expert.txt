 You are given a string consisting of characters $A$ and $B$ ( $A$ and $B$ are not brackets). You have to determine how many ways the characters $A$ and $B$ can be replaced by brackets so that the result is a regular bracket-sequence. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an even integer $N$ ($2 \le N \le 200$), the length of the string. The second line contains the string. Illegible characters are represented by the ‘?’ character. -----Output----- Output the number of regular bracket-sequences the string could have read. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 ()()() Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 10 (?([?)]?}? Sample Output 2: 3
