 You have recently made a grid traversing robot that can find its way from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner. However, you had forgotten all your AI programming skills, so you only programmed your robot to go rightwards and downwards (that s after all where the goal is). You have placed your robot on a grid with some obstacles, and you sit and observe. However, after a while you get tired of observing it getting stuck, and ask yourself 
-----Input----- On the first line is one integer, $1 \leq n \leq 1000$. Then follows $n$ lines, each with $n$ characters, where each character is one of ’.’ and ’#’, where ’.’ is to be interpreted as a walkable tile and ’#’ as a non-walkable tile. There will never be a wall at $s$, and there will never be a wall at $t$. -----Output----- Output one line with the number of different paths starting in $s$ and ending in $t$ (modulo $2^{31} - 1$) or THE GAME IS A LIE if you cannot go from $s$ to $t$ going only rightwards and downwards but you can if you are allowed to go left and up as well, or INCONCEIVABLE if there simply is no path from $s$ to $t$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 ..... #..#. #..#. ...#. ..... Sample Output: 6
