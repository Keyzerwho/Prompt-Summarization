The game is played by two players on an $8 \\times 8$ grid, with each player taking turns to move a piece. In this problem, we will consider a simplified variant of chess consisting of two kinds of pieces: kings and rooks. Kings can move one square in any direction while rooks can move any number of squares up/down or left/right. Pieces can either move to an unoccupied square or to a square occupied by an opponent s piece, which is captured and removed from play. A piece is threatened when an opponent s piece is able to capture the piece in a single move. It is illegal to move one own s king to a position where it is threatened (but it is legal to do so for a rook). A player is considered to be in checkmate when it is their turn, their king is threatened, and all possible moves will result in the king still being threatened. Yraglac is a skilled player and has managed to reach a situation where he has one king and one rook, while his opponent only has one king. Given that it is Yraglac s turn, can he checkmate his opponent in a single move  ",
