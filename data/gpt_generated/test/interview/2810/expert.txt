 Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.   
-----Input----- Input contains a description of one transit system. The description begins with a line containing an integer $3 \leq m \leq 9$ indicating the number of transit stations in the system. Stations are numbered $0$ to $m-1$. The next line contains an integer $1 \leq n \leq m(m-1)$ indicating the number of connections that follow, one connection per line. Each connection is a pair of integers $s~ t$ ($0 \leq s < m$, $0 \leq t < m$, $s \neq t$), indicating that there is a one-way connection from station $s$ to station $t$. -----Output----- Print the number of unique simple loops in the transit system. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 5 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 2 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 8 10 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 0 2 6 6 0 3 7 7 0 Sample Output 2: 3
