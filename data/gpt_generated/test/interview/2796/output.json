A pair of planets $A$, $B$ is boring if the following holds:  - $A$ and $B$ are different planets;  - travelling between planet $A$ and $B$ is possible using one or more interplanetary paths; and  - the binary XOR of the curiosity of all the paths in that travel is equal to 0 Alas, the times have changed and an evil emperor is ruling the galaxy. He decided to use the Force to destroy all the interplanetary paths in a certain order. Determine the number of boring pairs of planets before the emperor started the destruction and after each destruction. ",
