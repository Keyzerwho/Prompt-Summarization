Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}]. Define its prefix product sequence $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 
tl;dr: Consider a sequence [a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n}].  Let's define its prefix product sequence as $[ a_{1} \operatorname{mod} n,(a_{1} a_{2}) \operatorname{mod} n, \cdots,(a_{1} a_{2} \cdots a_{n}) \operatorname{mod} n ]$. Now given n, find a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n], such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n - 1]. 

There are $n$ programmers that you want to split into several non-empty teams. The skill of the $i$-th programmer is $a_i$. You want to assemble the maximum number of teams from them. There is a restriction for each team: the number of programmers in the team multiplied by the minimum skill among all programmers in the team must be at least $x$. Each programmer should belong to at most one team. Some programmers may be left without a team. Calculate the maximum number of teams that you can assemble. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of length $n$ and you want to split it into several non-empty sets. The value of $i$-th element is $a_i$. You want to generate the maximum number of sets from the list. There is a restriction for each set: the number of values in the team multiplied by the minimum value among all values in the team must be at least $x$. Each value should belong to at most one set. Some value may be left without being part of any set. 

You are given a sequence D_1, D_2, ..., D_N of length N. The values of D_i are all distinct. Does a tree with N vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., N.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., N-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - For each vertex i, the sum of the distances from i to the other vertices is D_i, assuming that the length of each edge is 1. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 100000  - 1 \leq D_i \leq 10^{12}  - D_i are all distinct.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there were $N$ planets. There were also $N - 1$ interplanetary paths that connected all the planets (directly or indirectly). In other words, the network of planets and paths formed a tree. Additionally, each path was enumerated with an integer that denoted the curiosity of the path. A pair of planets $A$, $B$ is boring if the following holds:  - $A$ and $B$ are different planets;  - travelling between planet $A$ and $B$ is possible using one or more interplanetary paths; and  - the binary XOR of the curiosity of all the paths in that travel is equal to 0 Alas, the times have changed and an evil emperor is ruling the galaxy. He decided to use the Force to destroy all the interplanetary paths in a certain order. Determine the number of boring pairs of planets before the emperor started the destruction and after each destruction.
