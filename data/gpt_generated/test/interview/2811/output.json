You would like to choose a subset of nodes such that there is no node in your subset which is an ancestor of any other node in your subset. For example, if A is the parent of B and B is the parent of C, then you could have at most one of A, B or C in your subset. In addition, you would like exactly $k$ of your chosen nodes to be red. If exactly $m$ of the nodes are red, then for all $k=0..m$, figure out how many ways you can choose subsets with $k$ red nodes, and no node is an ancestor of any other node.",
