Baby is getting his frst tooth. This means more sleepless nights, but with the fun of feeling round his gums and trying to guess which will be first out!  Probably best have a sweepstake with your friends - because you have the best chance of knowing. You can feel the gums and see where the raised bits are - most raised, most likely tooth to come through first! Given an array of numbers (t) to represent baby's gums, you need to return the index of the lump that is most pronounced.  The most pronounced lump is the one that has the biggest differential to its surrounding values. e.g.: ``` [1, 2, 4] = 2 index 0 has a differential of -1 to its right (it is lower so the figure is negative) index 1 has a differential of +1 to its left, and -2 to its right. Total is -1. index 2 has a differential of +2 to its left, and nothing to its right,  ``` If there is no distinct highest value (more than one occurence of the largest differential), return -1
tl;dr: Given an array of numbers t to represent baby's gums, you need to return the index of the lump that is most pronounced. The most pronounced lump is the one that has the biggest differential to its surrounding values. If there is no distinct highest value, return -1. 

The goal of this Kata is to return the greatest distance of index positions between matching number values in an array or 0 if there are no matching values.

Numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots n$ (each integer from $1$ to $n$ once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers $a$ and $b$ from the board and write one integer $\frac{a + b}{2}$ rounded up instead. You should perform the given operation $n - 1$ times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.  For example, if $n = 4$, the following course of action is optimal:  choose $a = 4$ and $b = 2$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3, 3]$;  choose $a = 3$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $3$, and the whiteboard contains $[1, 3]$;  choose $a = 1$ and $b = 3$, so the new number is $2$, and the whiteboard contains $[2]$.  It's easy to see that after $n - 1$ operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.

It s the slow crawl of rush hour. At any point of time, each vehicle is either stopped or is moving at the extremely slow speed of $1$ meter per second. Lately, vehicles come equipped with a simple  black box  that record all changes in a vehicle s speed. In this problem, speeds change instantaneously.  The road is modelled as the real line (units in meters). So a car is identified with its position on the line. Also, cars are $4.4$ meters long. Given initial positions of two cars that are driving along the real line in the positive direction and a transcript of their speed changes, did these cars ever collide  While such a collision would be very slow speed (a  bumper tap ), any collision could result in erroneous readings from the black box in the future so the portions of the transcripts after a collision might not make sense.
