How many days are we represented in a foreign country  My colleagues make business trips to a foreign country. We must find the number of days our company is represented in a country. Every day that one or more colleagues are present in the country is a day that the company is represented. A single day cannot count for more than one day. Write a function that recieves a list of pairs and returns the number of days that the company is represented in the foreign country. The first number of the pair is the number of the day of arrival and the second number of the pair is the day of departure of someone who travels, i.e. 1 january is number 1 and 31 of december is 365.

You're playing a game called Osu! Here's a simplified version of it. There are n clicks in a game. For each click there are two outcomes: correct or bad. Let us denote correct as "O", bad as "X", then the whole play can be encoded as a sequence of n characters "O" and "X". Using the play sequence you can calculate the score for the play as follows: for every maximal consecutive "O"s block, add the square of its length (the number of characters "O") to the score. For example, if your play can be encoded as "OOXOOOXXOO", then there's three maximal consecutive "O"s block "OO", "OOO", "OO", so your score will be 2^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 17. If there are no correct clicks in a play then the score for the play equals to 0. You know that the probability to click the i-th (1   i   n) click correctly is p_{i}. In other words, the i-th character in the play sequence has p_{i} probability to be "O", 1 - p_{i} to be "X". You task is to calculate the expected score for your play.

A multinational company is asking you to help them genetically modify an apple. In order for the apples to grow faster, to get more of them, to make them bigger and make them look nicer and more symmetrical, the apple s DNA requires an insertion of a certain swine gene. The apple s DNA is represented by a series of characters from the set $\{ A, C, G, T\} $. The required swine gene is also comprised of charaters from this set. The apple s DNA should be injected with some characters into some places, so that the resulting sequence contains a swine gene somewhere (in successive locations). To make things a bit more complicated, inserting each of the characters $A, C, G, T$ has its own cost. Help this multinational company in achieving their goal with the lowest possible total cost. As a reward, you get a ton of their apples.
