There are total N friends went to Chef's Pizza shop. There they bought a pizza. Chef divided the pizza into K equal slices. Now you have to check whether these K pizza slices can be distributed equally among the friends. Also given that every person should get at least one slice. If the above conditions are possible then print "YES" otherwise print "NO". 
tl;dr: You have to divided K equal slices of pizza to distribute among N people. Check whether these K pizza slices can be distributed equally among the N children if every child should get at least one slice. If it's possible then print "YES" otherwise print "NO". 

You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

A multinational company is asking you to help them genetically modify an apple. In order for the apples to grow faster, to get more of them, to make them bigger and make them look nicer and more symmetrical, the apple s DNA requires an insertion of a certain swine gene. The apple s DNA is represented by a series of characters from the set $\{ A, C, G, T\} $. The required swine gene is also comprised of charaters from this set. The apple s DNA should be injected with some characters into some places, so that the resulting sequence contains a swine gene somewhere (in successive locations). To make things a bit more complicated, inserting each of the characters $A, C, G, T$ has its own cost. Help this multinational company in achieving their goal with the lowest possible total cost. As a reward, you get a ton of their apples.
