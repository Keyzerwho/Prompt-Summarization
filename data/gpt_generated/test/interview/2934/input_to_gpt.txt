Master Oogway has forseen that a panda named Po will be the dragon warrior, and the master of Chi. But he did not tell anyone about the spell that would make him the master of Chi, and has left Po confused. Now Po has to defeat Kai, who is the super villian, the strongest of them all. Po needs to master Chi, and he finds a spell which unlocks his powerful Chi. But the spell is rather strange. It asks Po to calculate the factorial of a number! Po is very good at mathematics, and thinks that this is very easy. So he leaves the spell, thinking it's a hoax. But little does he know that this can give him the ultimate power of Chi. Help Po by solving the spell and proving that it's not a hoax. 
tl;dr: Find the factorial of each number from 1 to given positive integer n. 

$Neha$  is given a number $N$. She always looks for special thing , this time she is looking for $Special$ $Number$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Number$. A $Special$ $Number$ is a number whose product of its digits is equal to number itself i.e. $N $, and in this number there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it .Neha have to count the number of $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ . She is not so good in programming , so go and help her. 
tl;dr: You have to find a $Special$ $Number$  and a $Partial$ special number for a number N.Special Number are those product of its digits is equal to number itself and there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it. Print the count of the $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ .  

Pierre is famous for his macarons. He makes round macarons, stored in square boxes of size $1\times 1$, and oval-shaped macarons, stored in rectangular boxes of size $1\times 2$ (or, rotated, in rectangular boxes of size $2\times 1$). For the purpose of a buffet, Pierre wishes to tile a rectangular table of size $N\times M$ with the two kinds of macarons, meaning that the table must be completely full, with no empty space left. The width $N$ of the table is small, for the guest to be able to grab the macarons easily, and the length $M$ of the table is large, to accommodate a huge number of guests. To keep the table pretty, the orientation of macarons should always be aligned with the sides of the table. Pierre wishes to know how many ways there are to tile the table. Can you help him Input The input consists of the following integers:  - the value of $N$, an integer, on the first line;  - the value of $M$, an integer, on the second line.Limits The input satisfies $1 \leq N \leq 8$ and $1 \leq M \leq 10^{18}$.Output The output should consist of the total number of tilings, given modulo $10^9$, on a single line. -----
