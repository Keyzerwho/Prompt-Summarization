Haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry. A Haiku consists of three phrases with 5, 7 and 5 syllables, in this order. Iroha is looking for X,Y,Z-Haiku (defined below) in integer sequences. Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku  Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0   x < y < z < w   N) such that all of the following are satisfied:  - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X  - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y  - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Since the answer can be extremely large, print the number modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 3   N   40  - 1   X   5  - 1   Y   7  - 1   Z   5

In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible. The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem. You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once  Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a b c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a bbc" and "babbc". Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring. Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

Pierre is famous for his macarons. He makes round macarons, stored in square boxes of size $1\times 1$, and oval-shaped macarons, stored in rectangular boxes of size $1\times 2$ (or, rotated, in rectangular boxes of size $2\times 1$). For the purpose of a buffet, Pierre wishes to tile a rectangular table of size $N\times M$ with the two kinds of macarons, meaning that the table must be completely full, with no empty space left. The width $N$ of the table is small, for the guest to be able to grab the macarons easily, and the length $M$ of the table is large, to accommodate a huge number of guests. To keep the table pretty, the orientation of macarons should always be aligned with the sides of the table. Pierre wishes to know how many ways there are to tile the table. Can you help him Input The input consists of the following integers:  - the value of $N$, an integer, on the first line;  - the value of $M$, an integer, on the second line.Limits The input satisfies $1 \leq N \leq 8$ and $1 \leq M \leq 10^{18}$.Output The output should consist of the total number of tilings, given modulo $10^9$, on a single line. -----
