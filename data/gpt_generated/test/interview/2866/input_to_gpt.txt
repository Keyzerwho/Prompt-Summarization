It is lunch time for Mole. His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for lunch. Marmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile contains a_{i} worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms in first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a_1, worms in second pile are labeled with numbers a_1 + 1 to a_1 + a_2 and so on. See the example for a better understanding. Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we all know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy worms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile this worm is contained. Poor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said by Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers.

You may have already known that a standard ICPC team consists of exactly three members. The perfect team however has more restrictions. A student can have some specialization: coder or mathematician. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time. So the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one coder, at least one mathematician and it consists of exactly three members. You are a coach at a very large university and you know that $c$ of your students are coders, $m$ are mathematicians and $x$ have no specialization. What is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into   Note that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team. You are also asked to answer $q$ independent queries. 
tl;dr: A entity can have some specialization: A or B. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time. You need to form a team. So the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one A, at least one B and it consists of exactly three entities. You know that $c$ of the students are specialised in A, $m$ are in B and $x$ have no specialization. What is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into   Note that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team. You are also asked to answer $q$ independent queries.

The technology behind the fridge has changed little over the years. Even so, many of the original owners of the Fred W. Wolf domestic refrigerator of 1913 would be amazed by the size and features of the modern appliances. However, since the 1960s one thing has been common for all fridge owners around the world: fridge magnets. An effective, albeit lazy, way to keep a small child entertained is to supply them with a set of magnetic numbers and a large magnetic surface, such as said fridge, to provide the playing field upon which to apply these digits. Far from a time-wasting exercise, this provides valuable training in the mathematical field of counting: moving the digits around to form  1 ,  2 , and so on up to such heights as  10 ,  11 ,  12 , and even beyond. The possibilities are endless! ...Or at least, they would be, if the supply of digits was not limited. Given the full list of what numbers we are in possession of, what is the smallest positive number that cannot be made using each of digits at most once  
tl;dr:
