 You are given the initial volumes of soup in bowls and the temperature on each hour. Determine the total volume of soup evaporated in each hour. 
Examples Input 3 10 10 5 5 7 2 Output 5 12 4 Input 5 30 25 20 15 10 9 10 12 4 13 Output 9 20 35 11 25 Note In the first sample, In the first hour, 10 liters of soup is prepared, which evaporates to the size of 5 at the same hour. In the second hour, another 10 liters of soup is made. Since it is a bit warmer than the hour before, the first bowl gets empty while the second bowl shrinks to 3. At the end of the second hour, only one bowl with 3 liters soup is left. In the third hour, another bowl with less volume of soup is made, but as the temperature dropped too, both bowls survive till the end of the hour.
