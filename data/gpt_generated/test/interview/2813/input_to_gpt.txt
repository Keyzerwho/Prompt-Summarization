Igor the analyst has adopted n little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. Igor wants to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. He wants to make sure that all n pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area   [Image] Illustration to the first example.  
tl;dr: You have n bunnies. You have bought a carrot to be shared between these bunnies. You want to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus want to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. You want to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. Make sure that all n pieces have the same area. 

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"] i.e.

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out. ###

A haiku is a Japanese form of poetry. It consists of three phrases of $5$, $7$ and $5$ syllables each. Once a year, HiQ has a haiku contest, where employees submit their best poems. The poems are then judged based on a wide range of aspects, such as  - creativity  - simplicity  - beauty  - whether the poem is actually a haiku This last point turned out to be quite a challenge for the judges (many problems arose when half the judges indexed syllables starting at $0$ and the other half at $1$). Can you help the judges to determine whether a submitted poem is a haiku, given a set of syllables  Note that there may exist multiple decompositions of a single word in the poem into syllables. In this case, you should determine whether some decomposition is a haiku.
