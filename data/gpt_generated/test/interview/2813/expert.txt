 You have a set of syllables. A haiku is a Japanese form of poetry. It consists of three phrases of $5$, $7$ and $5$ syllables each. You need to determine whether a submitted poem is a haiku, given a set of syllables. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer $1 \le S \le 100$, the number of syllables. The next line contains $S$ words separated by spaces (the syllables). Each syllable contains at most $7$ lowercase letters a-z. Then, three lines containing the poem follow. Each line contains a (non-empty) list of words separated by spaces, representing a phrase. The words contain only lowercase letters a-z. The length of each line is at most $100$ characters (including spaces). It is guaranteed that there exists at least one decomposition of the poem into the given syllables. -----Output----- Output “haiku” if the given poem is a haiku, and “come back next year” otherwise (without the quotes). -----Explanation of Sample Input 1----- One possible decomposition into a haiku is: spe-lling ve-ry hard ear-ly in mor-ning ti-red i need cov-fe-fe -----Explanation of Sample Input 3----- No matter how the third line is decomposed, it contains $8$ syllables instead of $5$, so it can not be a haiku. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 20 va fi ve mor lling spe in i sh ti hard cov ear fe red ja ry need ly ning spelling very hard early in morning tired i need covfefe Sample Output 1: haiku Sample Input 2: 22 q c da plus to the e thee un late ci a shall by com i ru pare temp ble hi de shall i compare thee to a c plus plus template undecidable Sample Output 2: haiku
