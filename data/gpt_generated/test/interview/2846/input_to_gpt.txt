-----Problem Statement----- Levy's conjecture, named after Hyman Levy, states that all odd integers greater than 5 can be represented as the sum of an odd prime number and an even semiprime. To put it algebraically, 2n + 1 = p + 2q always has a solution in primes p and q (not necessary to be distinct) for n > 2. (Source: Wikipedia) In this problem, given a positive integer N (not necessary to be odd integer greater than 5). Your task is to calculate how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 
tl;dr: You are given a positive integer N.Find how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) are there such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 

You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide. We will call point a bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute (i.e. strictly less than $90^{\circ}$). Otherwise, the point is called good. The angle between vectors $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{y}$ in 5-dimensional space is defined as $\operatorname{arccos}(\frac{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y}}{|\vec{x}||\vec{y}|})$, where $\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_{1} y_{1} + x_{2} y_{2} + x_{3} y_{3} + x_{4} y_{4} + x_{5} y_{5}$ is the scalar product and $|\vec{x}|= \sqrt{\vec{x} \cdot \vec{x}}$ is length of $\vec{x}$. Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order.

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer `N`. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" `N`. ##

In research, it is tough to determine how good of a researcher you are. One way that people determine how good you are is by looking at your $H$-Index. Each paper has a certain number of citations. Your $H$-Index is the largest number $H$ such that you have $H$ papers with at least $H$ citations. Given the number of citations on each paper you have written, what is your $H$-Index
