Once again, Boris needs the help of Anton in creating a task. This time Anton needs to solve the following problem: There are two arrays of integers $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. It turned out that array $a$ contains only elements from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Anton can perform the following sequence of operations any number of times:  Choose any pair of indexes $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i < j \le n$. It is possible to choose the same pair $(i, j)$ more than once.   Add $a_i$ to $a_j$. In other words, $j$-th element of the array becomes equal to $a_i + a_j$.  For example, if you are given array $[1, -1, 0]$, you can transform it only to $[1, -1, -1]$, $[1, 0, 0]$ and $[1, -1, 1]$ by one operation. Anton wants to predict if it is possible to apply some number (zero or more) of these operations to the array $a$ so that it becomes equal to array $b$. Can you help him

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine whether we can turn S into a palindrome by repeating the operation of swapping two adjacent characters. If it is possible, find the minimum required number of operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq |S| \leq 2   10^5  - S consists of lowercase English letters.

In research, it is tough to determine how good of a researcher you are. One way that people determine how good you are is by looking at your $H$-Index. Each paper has a certain number of citations. Your $H$-Index is the largest number $H$ such that you have $H$ papers with at least $H$ citations. Given the number of citations on each paper you have written, what is your $H$-Index
