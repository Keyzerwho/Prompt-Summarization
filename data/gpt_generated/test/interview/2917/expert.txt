 Let $C_ n$ be the $n$th Catalan number as defined above. By regarding the sequence $(C_ n)_{n\geq 0}$ of Catalan numbers, we can define a sequence $(S_ n)_{n\geq 0}$, corresponding to squaring the Catalan sequence, by considering the Cauchy product, or discrete convolution, of $(C_ n)_{n\geq 0}$ with itself, i.e.,\[ S_ n = \sum _{k=0}^{n}C_ kC_{n-k}. \] Your task is to write a program for calculating the number $S_ n$. 
-----Input----- The input contains one line containing one non-negative integer: $n$, with $0 \leq n \leq 5000$. -----Output----- Output a line containing $S_ n$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 0 Sample Output: 1
