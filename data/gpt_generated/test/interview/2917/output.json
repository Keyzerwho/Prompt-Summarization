By regarding the sequence $(C_ n)_{n\\geq 0}$ of Catalan numbers, we can define a sequence $(S_ n)_{n\\geq 0}$, corresponding to squaring the Catalan sequence, by considering the Cauchy product, or discrete convolution, of $(C_ n)_{n\\geq 0}$ with itself, i.e.,\\[ S_ n = \\sum _{k=0}^{n}C_ kC_{n-k}. \\] Your task is to write a program for calculating the number $S_ n$.
