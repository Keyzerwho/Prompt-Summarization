Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between). For example: Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     3    / \   9  20     /  \    15   7 return its zigzag level order traversal as: [   [3],   [20,9],   [15,7]

For "x", determine how many positive integers less than or equal to "x" are odd but not prime. Assume "x" is an integer between 1 and 10000.

In this kata, your job is to return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible. The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.

A land far, far away has N Members of Parliament (MP). They had a turbulent and passionate debate on the law on amendments to the law on a new referendum on referendums. From Monday to Friday, all MPs joyfully came to work and argued all day. A diligent news reporter photographed MPs at their workplace in the heat of the argument every working day of the week. What she captured on the photos are pairs of MPs fighting and scowling at each other. The five photographs have been forwarded to you for thorough analysis. It is a fact that each MP belongs to one of the two political parties. Let s denote them with letters A and B. Your task is to estimate which MP belongs to which party, so that the following holds for your estimation: each MP argued with at most two distinct members of their own party.
