You are given a sequence a = \{a_1, ..., a_N\} with all zeros, and a sequence b = \{b_1, ..., b_N\} consisting of 0 and 1. The length of both is N. You can perform Q kinds of operations. The i-th operation is as follows:  - Replace each of a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, ..., a_{r_i} with 1. Minimize the hamming distance between a and b, that is, the number of i such that a_i \neq b_i, by performing some of the Q operations. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N \leq 200,000  - b consists of 0 and 1.  - 1 \leq Q \leq 200,000  - 1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq N  - If i \neq j, either l_i \neq l_j or r_i \neq r_j.

This is now a little serie :) Funny Dots You will get two Integer n (width) and m (height) and your task is to draw following pattern. Each line is seperated with '\n'. Both integers are equal or greater than 1. No need to check for invalid parameters. e.g.:                                           +---+---+---+             +---+                         | o | o | o | dot(1,1) => | o |          dot(3,2) =>    +---+---+---+                         +---+                         | o | o | o |                                           +---+---+---+  Serie: ASCII Fun ASCII Fun #1: X-Shape ASCII Fun #2: Funny Dots ASCII Fun #3: Puzzle Tiles ASCII Fun #4: Build a pyrami

A land far, far away has N Members of Parliament (MP). They had a turbulent and passionate debate on the law on amendments to the law on a new referendum on referendums. From Monday to Friday, all MPs joyfully came to work and argued all day. A diligent news reporter photographed MPs at their workplace in the heat of the argument every working day of the week. What she captured on the photos are pairs of MPs fighting and scowling at each other. The five photographs have been forwarded to you for thorough analysis. It is a fact that each MP belongs to one of the two political parties. Let s denote them with letters A and B. Your task is to estimate which MP belongs to which party, so that the following holds for your estimation: each MP argued with at most two distinct members of their own party.
