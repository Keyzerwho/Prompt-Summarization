 You will be given five photographs of MPs arguing. Your task is to estimate which MP belongs to which party, so that the following holds for your estimation: each MP argued with at most two distinct members of their own party.

-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 200000$), the number of MPs. MPs are denoted with numbers from $1$ to $N$. The following five lines describe the photographs taken from Monday to Friday. Each of the five lines contains the list of pairs of MPs that are arguing on the photograph that day (scowling at each other). Stated first is the number of pairs $P$ ($1 \leq P \leq N/2$), followed by $P$ pairs in the form “$K$ $L$”, where $K$ and $L$ are labels of MPs scowling at each other. Before each pair there is a double space. Of course, each MP is stated at most once per line, and no MP ever argues with herself. -----Output----- The first and only line of output must contain an array consisting of only characters A and B, so that the $K$-th character denotes the party of $K$-th MP in a division that satisfies the given conditions. Since the solution isn’t going to be unique, output any. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 7 2  1 2  7 3 2  1 3  7 4 2  1 4  7 5 2  1 5  7 6 2  1 6  7 2 Sample Output: ABBBBBA
