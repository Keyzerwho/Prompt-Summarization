In each city, Ash can choose either to train Pikachu or let Pikachu battle the Gym-leader (but not both). The Gym-leader in ith city has experience E[i]. If Pikachu enters a city i with strength S and decides to train, then this increases his strength by the cube of the sum of the digits in his current strength. For example, if he entered a city with a strength of 12, then training will increase his strength to 12 + (1+2)3 = 39. On the other hand, if he enters city i with strength S and battles the Gym-leader, then this increases his experience value XV by S*E[i]. Find the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain at the end of his journey.",
