The sequence of $m$ integers is called the permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $m$ exactly once. The number $m$ is called the length of the permutation. Dreamoon has two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$ of non-zero lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. Now Dreamoon concatenates these two permutations into another sequence $a$ of length $l_1 + l_2$. First $l_1$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_1$ and next $l_2$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_2$.  You are given the sequence $a$, and you need to find two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$. If there are several possible ways to restore them, you should find all of them. (Note that it is also possible that there will be no ways.)

----- ARRAY AND DISTINCT ELEMENTS ----- Chef is multitalented but he mistakenly took part in 2 contest which will take place at the same time. So while chef is busy at one cooking contest, he wants you to take part in coding contest. Chef wants u to solve this program for him. 	 You have been given an array of size n. You have to calculate a subarray of size k with maximum sum having distinct elements same as original array.

-----INOI 2017, Problem 2, Training----- Ash and his Pokemon Pikachu are going on a journey.  Ash has planned his route for the journey so that it passes through N cities, numbered 1, 2,  , N, and in this order. When they set out, Pikachu has an initial strength of Sin as well as an experience value (XV) of 0. As they travel they may increase his strength and experience value in a manner to be described below. In each city,  Ash can choose either to train Pikachu or let Pikachu battle the Gym-leader (but not both).  The Gym-leader in ith city has experience E[i]. If Pikachu enters a city i with strength S and decides to train, then this increases his strength by the cube of the sum of the digits in his current strength. For example, if he entered a city with a strength of 12, then training will increase his strength to 12 + (1+2)3 = 39.  On the other hand, if he enters city i with strength S and battles the Gym-leader, then this increases his experience value XV by S*E[i]. Ash wants your help to find out the maximum XV that Pikachu can attain  at the end of his journey.
