Saket loves to play with strings. One day , while he was having fun with Cyclic Permutations of available strings to him, he observed that despite being scarce in numbers Vowels were really clingy.Being clingy means for almost every given string, there was a Cyclic Permutation in which atleast two vowels were together. So he decided to check this property for all the available strings to him. As the number of strings can be very large, help Saket determine whether the given string is clingy or not. 
tl;dr: Given a string return "Yes" if there are two vowels adjacent in it (first and last letter are adjacent), "No" otherwise. 

Try guessing the statement from this picture:  $3$  You are given a non-negative integer $d$. You have to find two non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a + b = d$ and $a \cdot b = d$.

Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

The string $t_1t_2 \dots t_k$ is good if each letter of this string belongs to at least one palindrome of length greater than 1. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings A, BAB, ABBA, BAABBBAAB are palindromes, but the strings AB, ABBBAA, BBBA are not. Here are some examples of good strings:   $t$ = AABBB (letters $t_1$, $t_2$ belong to palindrome $t_1 \dots t_2$ and letters $t_3$, $t_4$, $t_5$ belong to palindrome $t_3 \dots t_5$);  $t$ = ABAA (letters $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ belong to palindrome $t_1 \dots t_3$ and letter $t_4$ belongs to palindrome $t_3 \dots t_4$);  $t$ = AAAAA (all letters belong to palindrome $t_1 \dots t_5$);  You are given a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of only letters A and B. You have to calculate the number of good substrings of string $s$.
