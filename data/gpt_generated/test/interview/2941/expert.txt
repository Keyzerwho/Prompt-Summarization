 You work at a clinic. The clinic factors in the waiting time when selecting patients to treat next. This approach was adopted to prevent patients from having to wait too long before being treated. Your task is to help the clinic perform 3 types of queries: 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains $2$ integers, $1 \leq N \leq 200000$, the number of queries to be processed, and $0 \leq K \leq 10000000$, the constant for the clinic. $N$ lines follow, each line beginning with an integer $Q$ where $Q$ = $1$, $2$ or $3$. $Q = 1$ denotes a query of the first type and will be followed by an integer $T$, a string $M$ and an integer $S$. $Q = 2$ denotes a query of the second type and will be followed by an integer $T$. $Q = 3$ denotes a query of the third type and will be followed by an integer $T$ and a string $M$. For all queries, $0 \leq T,S \leq 10000000$, and $T$ values are strictly increasing. $M$ is a non-empty alphanumeric string containing no spaces, and contains at most $10$ characters. All patients have unique names. There is at least one query of the second type. -----Output----- For each query of the second type, output the name of the patient who will be treated on a new line. If the clinic is empty, print the string “doctor takes a break” (without quotes) on a new line instead. -----Subtasks-----  - (28 Points): $1 \leq N \leq 10,000$. There is no query of type $3$. You can assume that $K = 0$.  - (32 Points): $1 \leq N \leq 10,000$. There is no query of type $3$.  - (20 Points): There is no query of type $3$.  - (20 Points): No additional constraints. -----Warning----- The I/O files are large. Please use fast I/O methods. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 1 1 10 Alice 5 1 15 Bob 15 2 20 2 25 2 30 Sample Output: Bob Alice doctor takes a break
