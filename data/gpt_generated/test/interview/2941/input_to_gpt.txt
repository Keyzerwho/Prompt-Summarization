Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length $n$. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway (lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the repair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is periodical: there are $g$ days when the weather is good and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather during the next $b$ days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it becomes low-quality pavement; again $g$ good days, $b$ bad days and so on. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in other words, days $1, 2, \dots, g$ are good. You don't really care about the quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of the highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the $n = 5$ then at least $3$ units of the highway should have high quality; if $n = 4$ then at least $2$ units should have high quality. What is the minimum number of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway

Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes. If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

You work at a clinic. The clinic factors in the waiting time when selecting patients to treat next. This approach was adopted to prevent patients from having to wait too long before being treated. Your task is to help the clinic perform $3$ types of queries:  - Process a patient arrival to the clinic. The patient will have an arrival time $T$, a name $M$, and a severity $S$ that is accessed automatically by scanners at the entrance.  - At time $T$, the doctor is ready to treat a patient. Every time this happens, the clinic will calculate priority values for every patient waiting in the clinic, and the patient with the highest priority value will be treated first. The priority value is computed as the following sum\[ S + K \cdot W \] where $S$ is the severity value of the patient, $K$ is the constant that the clinic uses, and $W$ is the total time the patient has been waiting in the clinic. If there are multiple patients with that value, the patient with the lexicographically smallest name is treated next. Your program will announce the name of that patient.  - At time $T$, the clinic receives a notification stating that, due to unfortunate circumstances, a patient with name $M$ has left the queue permanently. If no patient with name $M$ exists in the queue, it is always a false alarm and will be ignored by the clinic. Otherwise, the notification is guaranteed to be valid and should be processed accordingly.
