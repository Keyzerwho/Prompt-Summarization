You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself! There are $n$ cities in total on the Planet X, numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are currently at city $1$. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of $m$ bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The $i$-th teleporter costs $t_ i$ coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it s located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once if you visit that city.",
