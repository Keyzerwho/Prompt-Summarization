Alice's school is planning to take some students from her class on a field trip. Alice is really excited about it. There are a total of S students in her class. But due to budget constraints, the school is planning to take only N students for the trip. These students will be picked randomly. And each student has equal chance of being picked. Alice's friend circle has M students including her. Though she is excited about the field trip, she will enjoy it only if there are atleast K of her friends with her on the trip. She is wondering what are the chances of that happening. She needs your help. Tell her the probability that she will enjoy given that she goes on the trip. 
tl;dr: Only N items can be chosen randomly from a total of S items. You need M item including your one personal item. If there are atleast K item which are required and one your own item. What is the probability that you will purchase your K item with your one personal item. 

Dreamoon likes sequences very much. So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS:  You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, satisfying the following constraints:  The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$  Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$, where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or (xor). After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo $m$. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, with constraints. The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$   Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$,  where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or.  After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  You need to find the answer modulo $m$. 

There is a legendary tale about Dragon Balls on Planet X: if one collects seven Dragon Balls, the Dragon God will show up and help you fulfill your wishes. One day, you are surprised to discover that the tale might possibly be true: you found a Dragon Ball radar at a flea market! The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself! There are $n$ cities in total on the Planet X, numbered from $1$ to $n$. You are currently at city $1$. To travel from one city to another, you can take any of $m$ bidirectional teleport trips, as many times as you like. The $i$-th teleporter costs $t_ i$ coins to use each time, and it can teleport you between cities $a_ i$ and $b_ i$. To collect a Dragon Ball, you simply need to visit the city where it s located, as indicated on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once if you visit that city.
