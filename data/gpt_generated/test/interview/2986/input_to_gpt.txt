Dinesh is very fond of sweets recently his aunt Riya gifted him an array $a$ of sweets of size $N$. The ith sweet is of the type $a[i]$. His mother told him that he can choose one type of sweet in a day and eat at most 2 sweets of that type. Since he has to eat all the sweets as quickly as possible because his cousins are arriving. Find out the minimum number of days in which he can eat all the sweets gifted by his aunt Riya.

Saket loves to play with strings. One day , while he was having fun with Cyclic Permutations of available strings to him, he observed that despite being scarce in numbers Vowels were really clingy.Being clingy means for almost every given string, there was a Cyclic Permutation in which atleast two vowels were together. So he decided to check this property for all the available strings to him. As the number of strings can be very large, help Saket determine whether the given string is clingy or not. 
tl;dr: Given a string return "Yes" if there are two vowels adjacent in it (first and last letter are adjacent), "No" otherwise. 

This problem is an extension of another Kattis problem - backspace. In that problem, every time we see a character  < , it actually means that the  Backspace  key is pressed and we undo the last character that was just typed. The extension is as follows: Now, pressing a  <  (the  Backspace  key) when the (typing) cursor is at the front of the line does nothing. Now if we see a character  [ , it actually means that the  Home  key is pressed and we move the (typing) cursor to the front of the line. Similarly, if we see a character  ] , it actually means that the  End  key is pressed and we move the (typing) cursor the back of the line. For all other valid character in the input, it actually means that the corresponding key is pressed, we insert that character at the (typing) cursor position, and advance one position to the right the cursor accordingly. 
tl;dr:
