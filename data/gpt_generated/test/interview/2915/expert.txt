 You are given a list of locations and the number of letters to be delivered to each location. Find the shortest route that delivers all the letters.
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $K$, where $3 \leq N \leq 1000$ is the number of delivery addresses on the route, and $1 \leq K \leq 10000$ is the carrying capacity of the postal truck. Each of the following $N$ lines will contain two integers $x_ j$ and $t_ j$, the location of a delivery and the number of letters to deliver there, where $-1500 \leq x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_ N \leq 1500$ and $1 \leq t_ j \leq 800$ for all $j$. All delivery locations are nonzero (that is, none are at the post office). -----Output----- Output the minimum total travel distance needed to deliver all the letters and return to the post office. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 100 -10 50 10 175 25 20 Sample Output: 90
