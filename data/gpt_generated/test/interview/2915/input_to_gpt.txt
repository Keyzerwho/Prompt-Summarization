You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

Mike and Joe are fratboys that love beer and games that involve drinking. They play the following game: Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Mike can chug at most A beers in total (otherwise he would pass out), while Joe can chug at most B beers in total. Who will win the game   Write the function ```game(A,B)``` that returns the winner, ```"Mike"``` or ```"Joe"``` accordingly, for any given integer values of A and B. 
tl;dr: Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play"

The postal service is interested in cutting costs as an alternative to raising the postage rates. One way to do this is by minimizing the distance traveled when delivering mail from the post office to all the required locations and returning to the post office. It may be that all the mail to be delivered does not fit on the mail truck at once, in which case the distance traveled by the truck must include travel back to the post office to reload. For simplicity, we assume a one dimensional world with the post office at the origin, and delivery locations each identified by a single coordinate. As an example, suppose a postal truck can carry up to $100$ letters and that $50$ letters need to be delivered to location $-10$, that $175$ need to be delivered to location $10$, and $20$ delivered to location $25$. A maximally efficient plan would be: Deliver the $50$ letters to location $-10$ (travel $2 \cdot 10$), the first $100$ letters to location $10$ (travel $2 \cdot 10$), the remaining $75$ letters to location $10$ while on the way to delivering the $20$ to location $25$ (travel $2 \cdot 25$). The total round-trip distance traveled is $90$.
