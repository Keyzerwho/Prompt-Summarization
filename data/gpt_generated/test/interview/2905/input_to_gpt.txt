In this kata, you have to define a function named **func** that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - **[output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation]**, but **you must convert that specific number without built-in : bin,oct and hex functions.** 
tl;dr: In this task, you have to define a function named func that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - [output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation] 

Sereja has two integers   A and B   in 7-ary system. He wants to calculate the number C, such that B * C = A. It is guaranteed that B is a divisor of A. Please, help Sereja calculate the number C modulo 7L. 
tl;dr: You are given two positive integers   A and B   in 7-ary system such that B * C = A and  B is a divisor of A. Calculate the number C modulo 7L. 

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls $x = 0$). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices $0 \leq i < m$, such that $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \right\rfloor$ is odd. Tell her the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$.

  It s like how hot dogs come in packs of ten, and buns come in packs of eight or twelve   you have to buy nine packs to make it come out even.   This is a quote from the 1986 movie,  True Stories , and it s true; well, almost true. You could buy four packs of $10$ hotdogs and five packs of $8$ buns. That would give you exactly $40$ of each. However, you can make things even with fewer packs if you buy two packs of $10$ hotdogs, along with a pack of $8$ buns and another pack of $12$ buns. That would give you $20$ of each, using only $4$ total packs. For this problem, you ll determine the fewest packs you need to buy to make hotdogs and buns come out even, given a selection of different bun and hotdog packs available for purchase.
