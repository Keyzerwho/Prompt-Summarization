Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).  Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.  Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

Let $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ be an array of $n$ positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index $i$ such that $a_i = i$, and remove $a_i$ from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated). The weight of $a$ is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove. You must answer $q$ independent queries $(x, y)$: after replacing the $x$ first elements of $a$ and the $y$ last elements of $a$ by $n+1$ (making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of $a$

  It s like how hot dogs come in packs of ten, and buns come in packs of eight or twelve   you have to buy nine packs to make it come out even.   This is a quote from the 1986 movie,  True Stories , and it s true; well, almost true. You could buy four packs of $10$ hotdogs and five packs of $8$ buns. That would give you exactly $40$ of each. However, you can make things even with fewer packs if you buy two packs of $10$ hotdogs, along with a pack of $8$ buns and another pack of $12$ buns. That would give you $20$ of each, using only $4$ total packs. For this problem, you ll determine the fewest packs you need to buy to make hotdogs and buns come out even, given a selection of different bun and hotdog packs available for purchase.
