 You have to buy $n$ packs of hotdogs and $m$ packs of buns to make it come out even. 
-----Input----- The first input line starts with an integer, $H$, the number of hotdog packs available. This is followed by $H$ integers, $h_1 \ldots h_ H$, the number of hotdogs in each pack. The second input line starts with an integer, $B$, giving the number of bun packs available. This is followed by $B$ integers, $b_1 \ldots b_ B$, indicating the number of buns in each pack. The values $H$ and $B$ are between $0$ and $100$, inclusive, and the sizes of the packs are between $1$ and $1000$, inclusive. Every available pack is listed individually. For example, if there were five eight-bun packs available for purchase, the list of bun packs would contain five copies of the number eight. -----Output----- If it’s not possible to purchase an equal number of one or more hotdogs and buns, just output “impossible”. Otherwise, output the smallest number of total packs you can buy (counting both hotdog and bun packs) to get exactly the same number of hotdogs and buns. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 10 10 10 10 10 8 8 8 12 12 12 8 8 12 12 Sample Output: 4
