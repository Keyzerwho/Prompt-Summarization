You are to implement a simulation of gravity, based on the following rules: Whenever there is an empty cell immediately below an apple, the apple moves into the empty cell. Print out the final configuration of the board after all apples reach their final locations. Merely iterating the gravity rule, a step at a time, will likely take too long on large datasets. \n",
