 You are given a 2D grid. Each cell contains either an apple, an obstacle, or is empty. You must simulate gravity by moving apples into empty cells. Print out the final configuration of the board after all apples reach their final locations. 
-----Input----- The input begins with a line containing integers $R$ and $C$, designating the number of rows and columns of the grid, such that $1 \leq R \leq 50000$ and $1 \leq C \leq 10$. The first line is followed by $R$ additional lines, each designating a row of the grid, from top to bottom. Each line has $C$ characters, each of which is either ’.’, ’a’, or ’#’. -----Output----- Output $R$ grid lines displaying the final state. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 3 aaa #.. ..# Sample Output: a.. #.a .a#
