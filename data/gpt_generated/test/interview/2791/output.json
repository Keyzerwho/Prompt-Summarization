Because of this, sometimes when two integers are divided by the same divisor they become equal even though they were originally not equal. For example in C++, $\\verb|5/4|$ and $\\verb|7/4|$ are both equal to 1, but $5 \\neq 7$. Given a list of nonnegative integers and a divisor, how many pairs of distinct entries in the list are there that give the same result when both are divided by the divisor in C++",
