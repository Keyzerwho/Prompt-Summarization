This is a follow up from my kata The old switcheroo Write ```python def encode(str) ``` that takes in a string ```str``` and replaces all the letters with their respective positions in the English alphabet. ```python encode('abc') == '123'   # a is 1st in English alpabet, b is 2nd and c is 3rd encode('codewars') == '315452311819' encode('abc-#@5') == '123-#@5' ``` String are case sensitive
tl;dr: Write a function encode that takes in a string str and replaces all the letters with their respective positions in the English alphabet. String are case sensitive. 

You have $n$ barrels lined up in a row, numbered from left to right from one. Initially, the $i$-th barrel contains $a_i$ liters of water. You can pour water from one barrel to another. In one act of pouring, you can choose two different barrels $x$ and $y$ (the $x$-th barrel shouldn't be empty) and pour any possible amount of water from barrel $x$ to barrel $y$ (possibly, all water). You may assume that barrels have infinite capacity, so you can pour any amount of water in each of them.  Calculate the maximum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum amount of water in the barrels, if you can pour water at most $k$ times. Some examples:   if you have four barrels, each containing $5$ liters of water, and $k = 1$, you may pour $5$ liters from the second barrel into the fourth, so the amounts of water in the barrels are $[5, 0, 5, 10]$, and the difference between the maximum and the minimum is $10$;  if all barrels are empty, you can't make any operation, so the difference between the maximum and the minimum amount is still $0$.

Alice is a queen bee living in Beeland (a honeycomb structure described by $R$, the number of cells of the side of honeycomb). The cells in Beeland are numbered from $1$ to $R^3 - (R-1)^3$ in row major order. For example for $R = 3$, the Beeland that Alice lives in looks like this: Now Alice lives in a house that occupies $K$ adjacent cells in Beeland. You are Bob, the knight bee. You need to protect Alice s house, but first you need to know the length of its outer perimeter (the number of outermost sides of Alice s house). The illustration below shows the visualizations of Sample Inputs/Outputs $2$ and $3$.
