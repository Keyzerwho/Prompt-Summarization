 You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1   i < j   N. 
-----Input-----  - One line containing an integer $B$, ($1 \le B \le 20$), the number of types of beans available.  - One line containing $B$ integers, $V_1 \ldots V_ B$, ($0 \le V_1 \ldots V_ B \le 100$), the number of each kind of bean required.  - One line containing $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$), the number of other farms in Jackâ€™s small village.  - $T$ more lines, each beginning with an integer $M$ ($1 \le M \le B$) giving the number of kinds of bean this farmer grows. This is followed by $M$ more distinct integers $T_1 \ldots T_ M$ ($1 \le T_1 \ldots T_ M \le B$), each corresponding to one kind of bean. -----Output-----  - One line containing one integer: the number of cows Jack must bring with him in order to be $100\% $ sure of ending the day with enough beans to grow a magical beanstalk. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 5 1 1 1 Sample Output 1: 0 Sample Input 2: 3 5 5 5 2 2 1 2 2 2 3 Sample Output 2: 10
