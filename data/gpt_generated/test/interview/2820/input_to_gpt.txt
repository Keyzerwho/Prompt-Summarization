Dinesh is very fond of sweets recently his aunt Riya gifted him an array $a$ of sweets of size $N$. The ith sweet is of the type $a[i]$. His mother told him that he can choose one type of sweet in a day and eat at most 2 sweets of that type. Since he has to eat all the sweets as quickly as possible because his cousins are arriving. Find out the minimum number of days in which he can eat all the sweets gifted by his aunt Riya.  
tl;dr: You are given an array $a$ of item of size $N$.Only one type of item can be chosen in a day and purchased at most 2 items of that type.Find minimum number of days in which all items are purchased. 

You are given a sequence D_1, D_2, ..., D_N of length N. The values of D_i are all distinct. Does a tree with N vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., N.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., N-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - For each vertex i, the sum of the distances from i to the other vertices is D_i, assuming that the length of each edge is 1. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 100000  - 1 \leq D_i \leq 10^{12}  - D_i are all distinct.

Jack, na ve fellow that he is, has fallen into the clutches of a dastardly and sophisticated multi-level marketing scheme. It all started when a mysterious stranger pushed upon young Jack a bag of ordinary beans, promising that if only he could amass the right quantities of each kind of bean, he could grow a mighty beanstalk and climb it to the unimaginable wealth at its top. This all sounds very sensible to Jack... But there is one catch. He must acquire the extra beans from other farmers, who as one might expect are not too keen to give away the fruits (nor the seeds) of their labour. Each time Jack comes to ask for a bean, they will give him exactly one from their farm, but since he is not a paying customer the exact species may vary between farmers and between visits. There is another option, but it is expensive. Jack can give up some of his cows to the mysterious stranger in exchange for one additional bean per cow. Of course, this is a drastic measure. We would like to help Jack keep as many of his cows as possible, while still achieving his goals. How many cows will Jack need to budget for to have $100\% $ certainty of success
