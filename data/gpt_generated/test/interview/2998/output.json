            "text": " The current programming club president, Norbit, gives speeches at the weekly club meetings. Casual viewers are underwhelmed with the quality of Norbit's elocution. Specifically, Norbit often hesitates during his speeches with interjections like umm. You, however, are no casual viewer. You have noticed strange patterns in Norbit's speech. Norbit's interjections, when arranged together, form a binary code! By substituting $1$ s and $0$ s for u s and m s, respectively, you produce 7-bit binary ASCII codes that spell out secret messages. For example, the letter a has an ASCII code of $97$, which translates to a binary value of $1100001$ and an umm code of uummmmu. An umm code can be split up in the speech. For example, an encoding of a could be stretched across three utterances: uum, mmm, u (possibly with other non-umm code words occurring between them). Now that you have discovered Norbit's secret, you go back through transcripts of his previous speeches to decode his cleverly concealed messages. ",
