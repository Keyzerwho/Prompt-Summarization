            "text": " You, however, are no casual viewer you are a computer scientist! You have noticed strange patterns in Norbit s speech. Norbit s interjections, when arranged together, form a binary code! By substituting $1$ s and $0$ s for u s and m s, respectively, you produce 7-bit binary ASCII codes that spell out secret messages. For example, the letter a has an ASCII code of $97$, which translates to a binary value of $1100001$ and an umm code of uummmmu . An umm code can be split up in the speech. For example, an encoding of a could be stretched across three utterances: uum , mmm , u (possibly with other non-umm code words occurring between them). Now that you have discovered Norbit s secret, you go back through transcripts of his previous speeches to decode his cleverly concealed messages.",
