# Task  "AL-AHLY" and "Zamalek" are the best teams in Egypt, but "AL-AHLY" always wins the matches between them. "Zamalek" managers want to know what is the best match they've played so far.    The best match is the match they lost with the minimum goal difference. If there is more than one match with the same difference, choose the one "Zamalek" scored more goals in.    Given the information about all matches they played, return the `index` of the best match (`0-based`). If more than one valid result, return the smallest index. #

You have unweighted tree of $n$ vertices. You have to assign a positive weight to each edge so that the following condition would hold:   For every two different leaves $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ of this tree, bitwise XOR of weights of all edges on the simple path between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ has to be equal to $0$.  Note that you can put very large positive integers (like $10^{(10^{10})}$). It's guaranteed that such assignment always exists under given constraints. Now let's define $f$ as the number of distinct weights in assignment.  [Image] In this example, assignment is valid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between every pair of leaves is $0$. $f$ value is $2$ here, because there are $2$ distinct edge weights($4$ and $5$). [Image] In this example, assignment is invalid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between vertex $1$ and vertex $6$ ($3, 4, 5, 4$) is not $0$.  What are the minimum and the maximum possible values of $f$ for the given tree  Find and print both.

The current programming club president, Norbit, gives speeches at the weekly club meetings. Casual viewers are underwhelmed with the quality of Norbit s elocution. Specifically, Norbit often hesitates during his speeches with interjections like  umm.  You, however, are no casual viewer you are a computer scientist! You have noticed strange patterns in Norbit s speech. Norbit s interjections, when arranged together, form a binary code! By substituting $1$ s and $0$ s for u s and m s, respectively, you produce 7-bit binary ASCII codes that spell out secret messages. For example, the letter  a  has an ASCII code of $97$, which translates to a binary value of $1100001$ and an umm code of  uummmmu . An umm code can be split up in the speech. For example, an encoding of  a  could be stretched across three utterances:  uum ,  mmm ,  u  (possibly with other non-umm code words occurring between them). Now that you have discovered Norbit s secret, you go back through transcripts of his previous speeches to decode his cleverly concealed messages.
