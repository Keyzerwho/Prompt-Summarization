You, the player, can move north, south, east, and west, except where there are obstacles. The player may also stay put. There is one creeper on the map. The player and the creeper take turns simultaneously, subject to the following simple AI: - The creeper will only try to move towards the player, either horizontally or vertically, in a way that reduces the horizontal or vertical distance. - If an obstacle prevents the creeper from moving vertically, it will try to move horizontally, and vice versa. - If it can't move in either direction, it will stay put. - If the creeper can move both horizontally and vertically, it will choose the direction in which it is farther away from the player. In the case of a tie, it will move vertically towards the player. After each such turn, the game checks if the creeper is too close to the player, in which case the creeper will explode and kill the player, even if the player has already reached the exit in that move. Obstacles do not protect the player from explosions. If the player did not explode and reached the exit, the mission is completed.",
