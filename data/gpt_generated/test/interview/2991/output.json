The gnomes could line up like so: $1, 3, 4, 2, 5$. Now, an evil magician will remove some of the gnomes from the lineup and wipe your memory of the order of the gnomes. The result is a subsequence, perhaps like so: $1, 4, 2$. He then tells you that if you ordered all permutations of $1..n$ in lexicographical order, the original sequence of gnomes is the first such permutation which contains the remaining subsequence. Your task is to find the original sequence of gnomes.",
