Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample. Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed. Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time. Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers. 
tl;dr: There are n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks.  Block is called internal if all its neighbors has each side adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation you can destroy all boundary blocks. Count how many operations you will take to destroy all towers. 

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships. 
tl;dr: Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. There are no adjacent structures. 

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer `N`. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" `N`. ##

For the grand opening of the algorithmic games in NlogNsglow, a row of tower blocks is set to be demolished in a grand demonstration of renewal. Originally the plan was to accomplish this with controlled explosions, one for each tower block, but time constraints now require a hastier solution. To help you remove the blocks more rapidly you have been given the use of a Universal Kinetic / Incandescent Energy Particle Cannon (UKIEPC). On a single charge, this cutting-edge contraption can remove either all of the floors in a single tower block, or all the $x$-th floors in all the blocks simultaneously, for user s choice of the floor number $x$. In the latter case, the blocks that are less than $x$ floors high are left untouched, while for blocks having more than $x$ floors, all the floors above the removed $x$-th one fall down by one level. -----Task----- Given the number of floors of all towers, output the minimum number of charges needed to eliminate all floors of all blocks.
