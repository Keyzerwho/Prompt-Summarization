Python dictionaries are inherently unsorted. So what do you do if you need to sort the contents of a dictionary  Create a function that returns a sorted list of `(key, value)` tuples (Javascript: arrays of 2 items). The list must be sorted by the `value` and be sorted **largest to smallest**. ## 
tl;dr: Create a function that returns a sorted list of (key, value) tuples. The list must be sorted by the value from largest to smallest. 

There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

Chef Vivek is good in mathematics and likes solving problems on prime numbers. One day his friend Jatin told him about Victory numbers. Victory number can be defined as a number formed after summing up all the prime numbers till given number n. Now, chef Vivek who is very fond of solving questions on prime numbers got busy in some other tasks. Your task is to help him finding victory number. 
tl;dr: Find sum the sum of all the prime numbers which are less than the given number N. 

Snuke has an integer sequence A of length N. He will make three cuts in A and divide it into four (non-empty) contiguous subsequences B, C, D and E. The positions of the cuts can be freely chosen. Let P,Q,R,S be the sums of the elements in B,C,D,E, respectively. Snuke is happier when the absolute difference of the maximum and the minimum among P,Q,R,S is smaller. Find the minimum possible absolute difference of the maximum and the minimum among P,Q,R,S. -----Constraints-----  - 4 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5  - 1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9  - All values in input are integers.
