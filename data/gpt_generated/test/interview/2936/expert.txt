 You are given an array $A$ of $n$ integers, and the task is to find $k$ disjoint, contiguous subarrays of $A$ so that their total sum is maximum. 
-----Input----- The input will consist of two lines. On the first line are the integers $n$ and $k$, ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 5000$). On the second line are $n$ integers, representing the array $A$. The integers in array $A$ will be between $-10^9$ and $10^9$, inclusive. -----Output----- Output the maximum possible total sum of $k$ disjoint contiguous subarrays of array $A$. Although the subarrays are required to be disjoint, a subarray may end at index $i$ and another subarray start at index $i+1$. No subarray is allowed to be empty. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 9 1 -2 3 5 -7 8 13 -20 14 1 Sample Output: 22
