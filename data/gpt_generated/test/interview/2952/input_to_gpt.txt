Jon and Joe have received equal marks in the school examination.  But, they won't reconcile in peace when equated with each other.  To prove his might, Jon challenges Joe to write a program to find all possible number combos that sum to a given number.  While unsure whether he would be able to accomplish this feat or not, Joe accpets the challenge.  Being Joe's friend, your task is to help him out. # Task Create a function `combos`, that accepts a single positive integer `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. 
tl;dr: Your need to create a function `combos` that accepts `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. For an optimal solution, the following operation should complete within 6000ms

The "BerCorp" company has got n employees. These employees can use m approved official languages for the formal correspondence. The languages are numbered with integers from 1 to m. For each employee we have the list of languages, which he knows. This list could be empty, i. e. an employee may know no official languages. But the employees are willing to learn any number of official languages, as long as the company pays their lessons. A study course in one language for one employee costs 1 berdollar. Find the minimum sum of money the company needs to spend so as any employee could correspond to any other one (their correspondence can be indirect, i. e. other employees can help out translating). 
tl;dr: You are given n sets which are a subset of the set of natural numbers in the range 1 to m. You can add a single number to any one set at the cost 1. Find the minimum total cost such that for every pair of sets the union is not a null set. 

Sandu, a teacher in Chefland introduced his students to a new sequence i.e. 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,4........ The Sequence starts from 0 and increases by one till $i$(initially i equals to 1), then repeat itself with $i$ changed to $i+1$ Students being curious about the sequence asks the Nth element of the sequence. Help Sandu to answer the Students

Alice, Bob, and Clara are eating at a new restaurant today. They re having trouble deciding what to order, so Alice proposes that they each pick some items from the menu, and then they will order the items that everyone picked. The menu has $m$ items, and Alice, Bob, and Clara will order $a$, $b$, and $c$ items respectively. Is it possible for them to pick some items such that no item is picked by everyone
