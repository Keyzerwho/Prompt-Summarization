----- ARRAY AND DISTINCT ELEMENTS ----- Chef is multitalented but he mistakenly took part in 2 contest which will take place at the same time. So while chef is busy at one cooking contest, he wants you to take part in coding contest. Chef wants u to solve this program for him. 	 You have been given an array of size n. You have to calculate a subarray of size k with maximum sum having distinct elements same as original array. 		 		 
tl;dr: You are given an array of size n. Calculate a subarray of size k with maximum sum having distinct elements same as original array. 	 		 

The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, $n$ is always even, and in C2, $n$ is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with $2 \cdot n$ vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length $1$. Let's name it as $2n$-gon. Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed $2n$-gon in the square. Embedding $2n$-gon in the square means that you need to place $2n$-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of $2n$-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can rotate $2n$-gon and/or the square.

Alice, Bob, and Clara are eating at a new restaurant today. They re having trouble deciding what to order, so Alice proposes that they each pick some items from the menu, and then they will order the items that everyone picked. The menu has $m$ items, and Alice, Bob, and Clara will order $a$, $b$, and $c$ items respectively. Is it possible for them to pick some items such that no item is picked by everyone
