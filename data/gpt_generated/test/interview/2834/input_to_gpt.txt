An AI has infected a text with a character!!  This text is now **fully mutated** to this character. If the text or the character are empty, return an empty string.   There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!! **

There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in it. Currently k games had already been played.  You are an avid football fan, but recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess of your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of wins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number of wins of first and second team will be d_1 and that of between second and third team will be d_2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is each team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you want to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's guess such that no team will win this tournament  Note that outcome of a match can not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. 
tl;dr: Let x, y, and z, be non-negative integers. d_1 reprsents the absolute difference between x and y, and d_2 represents the absolute difference between y and z. Your goal is to figure out if d_1 and d_2 can become equivlanet after all moves have been expended. In each move, you can increment x, y, or z by 1. You will be given n, the total number of moves you're allowed, and k, the number of moves that had already been used. 

Digits $4$ and $7$ are lucky, while all others are unlucky. An integer is lucky if it contains only lucky digits in decimal notation. We would like to know the $K$-th lucky positive integer.
