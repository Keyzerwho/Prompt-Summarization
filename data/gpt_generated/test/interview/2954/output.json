ByteLand consists of of $N$ intersections and $M$ roads. Every road is bidirectional and connects two distinct intersections. Anthony is currently on intersection $s$ and the concert is being held at intersection $t$. Anthony must get to the concert in $T$ seconds and he can travel at $1$ meter/second. Unfortunately for Anthony, he has a huge fear of spiders and ByteLand is full of spiders. Spiders reside at certain intersections in ByteLand. Anthony will choose a path from $s$ to $t$ that maximizes $D$, the minimum distance between any intersection on the path and any spider, such that the path can be travelled in no more than $T$ seconds.
