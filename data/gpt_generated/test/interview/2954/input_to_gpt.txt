# Task Elections are in progress! Given an array of numbers representing votes given to each of the candidates, and an integer which is equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet, find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election. The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate. If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all. **Note**: big arrays will be tested. #

You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.  Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1. Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.

Jimmy is performing in ByteLand today! Anthony the Ant is a huge fan of Jimmy s music, so he can t wait to get to the concert. ByteLand consists of of $N$ intersections and $M$ roads. Every road is bidirectional and connects two distinct intersections. Anthony is currently on intersection $s$ and the concert is being held at intersection $t$. Anthony must get to the concert in $T$ seconds and he can travel at $1$ meter/second. Unfortunately for Anthony, he has a huge fear of spiders and ByteLand is full of spiders. Spiders reside at certain intersections in ByteLand. Anthony will choose a path from $s$ to $t$ that maximizes $D$, the minimum distance between any intersection on the path and any spider, such that the path can be travelled in no more than $T$ seconds.
