 Given a map of ones and zeros, determine if it is possible for a binary or decimal user to get from one location to another. 
-----Input----- Input starts with a line containing two positive integers, $1 \le r \le 1000$ and $1 \le c \le 1000$. The next $r$ input lines give the contents of the map, each line containing exactly $c$ characters (which are all chosen from $0$ or $1$). The next line has an integer $0 \le n \le 1000$. The following $n$ lines each contain one query, given as four integers: $r_1,c_1$ and $r_2,c_2$. These two pairs indicate two locations on the map, and their limits are $1 \le r_1, r_2 \le r$ and $1 \le c_1, c_2 \le c$. -----Output----- For each query, output binary if a binary user can start from location $r_1, c_1$ and move to location $r_2, c_2$. Output decimal if a decimal user can move between the two locations. Otherwise, output neither. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 4 1100 2 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 Sample Output: neither decimal
