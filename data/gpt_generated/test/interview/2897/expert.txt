 You have to figure out if it is possible for either type of person to get between various locations of interest. People can move north, south, east or west, but cannot move diagonally.
-----Input----- Input starts with a line containing two positive integers, $1 \le r \le 1000$ and $1 \le c \le 1000$. The next $r$ input lines give the contents of the map, each line containing exactly $c$ characters (which are all chosen from $0$ or $1$). The next line has an integer $0 \le n \le 1000$. The following $n$ lines each contain one query, given as four integers: $r_1,c_1$ and $r_2,c_2$. These two pairs indicate two locations on the map, and their limits are $1 \le r_1, r_2 \le r$ and $1 \le c_1, c_2 \le c$. -----Output----- For each query, output binary if a binary user can start from location $r_1, c_1$ and move to location $r_2, c_2$. Output decimal if a decimal user can move between the two locations. Otherwise, output neither. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 4 1100 2 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 Sample Output: neither decimal
