You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening  Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages. These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before: * hello - english * ciao - italian * salut - french * hallo - german * hola - spanish * ahoj - czech republic * czesc - polish By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!! PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test) PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the test
tl;dr: Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hello in different languages. Regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests

This is now a little serie :) Funny Dots You will get two Integer n (width) and m (height) and your task is to draw following pattern. Each line is seperated with '\n'. Both integers are equal or greater than 1. No need to check for invalid parameters. e.g.:                                           +---+---+---+             +---+                         | o | o | o | dot(1,1) => | o |          dot(3,2) =>    +---+---+---+                         +---+                         | o | o | o |                                           +---+---+---+  Serie: ASCII Fun ASCII Fun #1: X-Shape ASCII Fun #2: Funny Dots ASCII Fun #3: Puzzle Tiles ASCII Fun #4: Build a pyrami
tl;dr: You will be given two integers and your task is to draw following pattern. 

The world is made up of $10$ kinds of people, those who understand binary and those who do not. These different kinds of people do not always get along so well. Bob might ask for a $10000$ ounce coffee (meaning binary) and Alice might make misinterpret his request as being in decimal and give him a $10011100010000$ ounce coffee (binary). After Sue explains that this much coffee costs $100$ dollars (decimal), Bob might assume he only has to pay $4$ dollars (interpreting the price as being in binary). In response to these differences that are difficult to resolve, these two groups have divided the world into two regions, the binary-friendly zones and the decimal-friendly zones. They have even published a map like the following to help people keep up with where the areas are (they have used ones and zeros so nobody would have trouble reading it).1111100000 1111000000 1110000011 0111100111 0011111111 Users of binary have to stay in the zones marked with a zero. Users of decimal have to stay in the zones marked with a one. You have to figure out if it is possible for either type of person to get between various locations of interest. People can move north, south, east or west, but cannot move diagonally.
