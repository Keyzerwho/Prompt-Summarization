            "text": " In geometry, ellipses are defined by two focal points $f_1, f_2$ and a length $D$. The ellipse consists of all points $p$ such that $\\mathop {\\mathrm{distance}}(f_1, p) + \\mathop {\\mathrm{distance}}(f_2, p) = D$. When one normally thinks of ellipses, it is in the context of the Euclidean 2D plane, with the Euclidean distance as a distance measure. This problem explores a different kind of ellipse. The space we will work in is the space of words of length $n$ using an alphabet of $q$ different symbols, often denoted as $F_ q^n$. As you can probably see, for given values of $q$ and $n$, there are $q^n$ different words (points) in the space $F_ q^n$. For a distance measure, we use the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two words $x, y \\in F_ q^n$ is simply the number of positions where the symbols that make up the words $x$ and $y$ differ. For example, the Hamming distance between words 01201 and 21210 is 3 because there are 3 positions where the words have different symbols. The Hamming distance between any two words in $F_ q^n$ will always be an integer between $0$ and $n$, inclusive. Within the space $F_ q^n$, we now define the Hamming ellipse as the set of all points $p$ such that $\\mathop {\\mathrm{ham",
