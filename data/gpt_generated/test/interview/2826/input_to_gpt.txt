You are the principal of the Cake school in chefland and today is your birthday. You want to treat each of the children with a small cupcake which is made by you. But there is a problem, You don't know how many students are present today. The students have gathered of the morning assembly in $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Now you have to calculate how many cakes you have to make such that each child gets a cupcake.  
tl;dr: You are given $R$ rows and $C$ columns of a matrix. Calculate the total number in the matrix.  

The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, $n$ is always even, and in C2, $n$ is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with $2 \cdot n$ vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length $1$. Let's name it as $2n$-gon. Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed $2n$-gon in the square. Embedding $2n$-gon in the square means that you need to place $2n$-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of $2n$-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can rotate $2n$-gon and/or the square.

Given an array containing only zeros and ones, find the index of the zero that, if converted to one, will make the longest sequence of ones. For instance, given the array: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ``` replacing the zero at index 10 (counting from 0) forms a sequence of 9 ones: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]                   '------------^------------' ``` Your task is to complete the function that determines where to replace a zero with a one to make the maximum length subsequence. **

In geometry, ellipses are defined by two focal points $f_1, f_2$ and a length $D$. The ellipse consists of all points $p$ such that $\mathop {\mathrm{distance}}(f_1, p) + \mathop {\mathrm{distance}}(f_2, p) = D$. When one normally thinks of ellipses, it is in the context of the Euclidean 2D plane, with the Euclidean distance as a distance measure. This problem explores a different kind of ellipse. The space we will work in is the space of words of length $n$ using an alphabet of $q$ different symbols, often denoted as $F_ q^n$. As you can probably see, for given values of $q$ and $n$, there are $q^n$ different words (points) in the space $F_ q^n$. For a distance measure, we use the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance between two words $x, y \in F_ q^n$ is simply the number of positions where the symbols that make up the words $x$ and $y$ differ. For example, the Hamming distance between words 01201 and 21210 is 3 because there are 3 positions where the words have different symbols. The Hamming distance between any two words in $F_ q^n$ will always be an integer between $0$ and $n$, inclusive. Within the space $F_ q^n$, we now define the Hamming ellipse as the set of all points $p$ such that $\mathop {\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_1, p) + \mathop {\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_2, p) = D$. Given values $q$ and $n$, focal points $f_1$ and $f_2$ and distance $D$, we ask you to determine the number of points $p \in F_ q^n$ that lie on this Hamming ellipse.
