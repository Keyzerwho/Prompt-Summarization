Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations. The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).   The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation. ### 
tl;dr: You are given an operation and two values. Return result of numbers after applying the operation. 

Given an array of numbers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values.  For example: `[23, 3, 19, 21, 16]` should return `20` (i.e., `23 - 3`). `[1, 434, 555, 34, 112]` should return `554` (i.e., `555 - 1`). The array will contain a minimum of two elements. Input data range guarantees that `max-min` will cause no integer overflow

George has won the lottery and, being a nice guy, has decided to spread the wealth around. However, monetary gifts can be taxed once they get over a certain size the amount of tax depends on how much his friends have earned that year. The amount of tax paid depends on tax bands. The bands start at zero. Each one takes a certain cut of income from the range of pre-tax income it covers. The final tax band applies to all income above its lower bound. George is a savvy fellow and knows the number of tax bands, the amount of money each friend has earned and the amount he wants each friend to walk away with. How much should George give to each friend before tax
