# Task  Consider the following algorithm for constructing 26 strings S(1) .. S(26): ``` S(1) = "a"; For i in [2, 3, ..., 26]: S(i) = S(i - 1) + character(i) + S(i - 1).```  For example: ``` S(1) = "a" S(2) = S(1) + "b" + S(1) = "a" + "b" + "a" = "aba" S(3) = S(2) + "c" + S(2) = "aba" + "c" +"aba" = "abacaba" ... S(26) = S(25) + "z" + S(25)``` Finally, we got a long string S(26). Your task is to find the `k`th symbol (indexing from 1) in the string S(26). All strings consist of lowercase letters only. # Input / Output  - `[input]` integer `k`   1   k < 2^(26)  - `[output]` a string(char in C#)   the `k`th symbol of S(26

Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer. For example, the number `417` is `110100001` in binary. Reversing the binary is `100001011` which is `267`. You can assume that the number is not negative
tl;dr: Reverses the bits in a positive integer. 

Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n.

George has won the lottery and, being a nice guy, has decided to spread the wealth around. However, monetary gifts can be taxed once they get over a certain size the amount of tax depends on how much his friends have earned that year. The amount of tax paid depends on tax bands. The bands start at zero. Each one takes a certain cut of income from the range of pre-tax income it covers. The final tax band applies to all income above its lower bound. George is a savvy fellow and knows the number of tax bands, the amount of money each friend has earned and the amount he wants each friend to walk away with. How much should George give to each friend before tax
