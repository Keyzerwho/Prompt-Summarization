Polycarp analyzes the prices of the new berPhone. At his disposal are the prices for $n$ last days: $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, where $a_i$ is the price of berPhone on the day $i$. Polycarp considers the price on the day $i$ to be bad if later (that is, a day with a greater number) berPhone was sold at a lower price. For example, if $n=6$ and $a=[3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 5]$, then the number of days with a bad price is $3$   these are days $2$ ($a_2=9$), $4$ ($a_4=6$) and $5$ ($a_5=7$). Print the number of days with a bad price. You have to answer $t$ independent data sets. 
tl;dr: you are given a list of of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that index

In the card game Wolf (a variant of the famous card games War and Sv lta r v), two players both have a pile of cards, which together form a normal deck of playing cards. Such a deck contains $52$ cards, with each card being a unique combination of one of $4$ suits and $13$ ranks. During a turn, each player picks the topmost card from their piles, and shows it. This process is repeated until the two cards have the same suit. Then, the player whose card had the highest rank receives all the cards that have been shown by the players during the turn (including the two that had the same suit), and these cards are shuffled into that player s pile. The turn then ends. The turn also ends if any player, when they are supposed to pick a card from their pile, has an empty pile. A player wins if, after the end of a turn, she has cards remaining in her pile but the opposing player has no cards remaining in their pile. This means that the game is tied if neither player has cards in their pile after the end of a turn. Your opponent is currently taking a bathroom break, so you have the opportunity to reshuffle your piles. You cannot exchange any cards, since your opponent knows the set of cards in their pile. Is it possible to reshuffle each of the two piles, so that you have won the game after the next turn
