 You are given two piles of cards. You can only shuffle the piles. Is it possible to win the game after the next turn? 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains the number of cards in your hand ($0 \leq n \leq 52$). Each of the next $n$ lines contains a card specified by a number from $1$ to $13$ and one of the letters ’C’, ’D’, ’H’, ’S’, separated by a space. The letter of a card specifies its suit (either clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades, respectively). The number of a card specifies the rank of the card. For simplicity, aces are represented as a $1$, and jacks, queens and kings are represented as the numbers $11$, $12$ and $13$. For the purpose of this problem, we consider a rank $a$ to be lower than a rank $b$ if the number of rank $a$ is lower than the number of rank $b$ (meaning aces are of the lowest rank). -----Output----- Output “possible” if it is possible to reshuffle the decks, and “impossible” if it is not. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 28 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 5 C 6 C 7 C 1 D 2 D 3 D 4 D 5 D 6 D 7 D 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 H 5 H 6 H 7 H 1 S 2 S 3 S 4 S 5 S 6 S 7 S Sample Output: possible
