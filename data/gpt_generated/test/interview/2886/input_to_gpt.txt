Limak is a little bear who loves to play. Today he is playing by destroying block towers. He built n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks. For clarification see picture for the first sample. Limak will repeat the following operation till everything is destroyed. Block is called internal if it has all four neighbors, i.e. it has each side (top, left, down and right) adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation Limak destroys all boundary blocks. His paws are very fast and he destroys all those blocks at the same time. Limak is ready to start. You task is to count how many operations will it take him to destroy all towers. 
tl;dr: There are n towers in a row. The i-th tower is made of h_{i} identical blocks.  Block is called internal if all its neighbors has each side adjacent to other block or to the floor. Otherwise, block is boundary. In one operation you can destroy all boundary blocks. Count how many operations you will take to destroy all towers. 

You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest. There are $N$ submissions, numbered $1$ through $N$. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th submission was submitted at time $S_i$ and judged at time $J_i$ (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than $5$ minutes.

Given a string t, we will call it unbalanced if and only if the length of t is at least 2, and more than half of the letters in t are the same. For example, both voodoo and melee are unbalanced, while neither noon nor a is. You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters. Determine if there exists a (contiguous) substring of s that is unbalanced. If the answer is positive, show a position where such a substring occurs in s. -----Constraints-----  - 2   |s|   10^5  - s consists of lowercase letters. -----Partial Score-----  - 200 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying 2   N   100.
