In this problem the input will consist of a number of lines of English text consisting of the letters of the English alphabet, the punctuation marks ' (apostrophe), . (full stop), , (comma), ; (semicolon), :(colon) and white space characters (blank, newline). Your task is print the words in the text in lexicographic order (that is, dictionary order). Each word should appear exactly once in your list. You can ignore the case (for instance, "The" and "the" are to be treated as the same word). There should be no uppercase letters in the output. For example, consider the following candidate for the input text:  This is a sample piece of text to illustrate this  problem. The corresponding output would read as: a illustrate is of piece problem sample text this to 
tl;dr: You have to print the words in the given text in lexicographic order. Each word should appear exactly once and there should be no uppercase letters in the output. 

You are given an array $a$ of $n$ integers. You want to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero by doing the following operation exactly three times:  Select a segment, for each number in this segment we can add a multiple of $len$ to it, where $len$ is the length of this segment (added integers can be different).  It can be proven that it is always possible to make all elements of $a$ equal to zero.

You are given a permutation $p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Let's call the number $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) beautiful, if there exists two indices $l, r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$), such that the numbers $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$. For example, let $p = [4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$. In this case, the numbers $1, 3, 5, 6$ are beautiful and $2, 4$ are not. It is because:  if $l = 3$ and $r = 3$ we will have a permutation $[1]$ for $m = 1$;  if $l = 3$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 3$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 5$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2]$ for $m = 5$;  if $l = 1$ and $r = 6$ we will have a permutation $[4, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6]$ for $m = 6$;  it is impossible to take some $l$ and $r$, such that $[p_l, p_{l+1}, \ldots, p_r]$ is a permutation of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, m$ for $m = 2$ and for $m = 4$.  You are given a permutation $p=[p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n]$. For all $m$ ($1 \le m \le n$) determine if it is a beautiful number or not.

Given a string t, we will call it unbalanced if and only if the length of t is at least 2, and more than half of the letters in t are the same. For example, both voodoo and melee are unbalanced, while neither noon nor a is. You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters. Determine if there exists a (contiguous) substring of s that is unbalanced. If the answer is positive, show a position where such a substring occurs in s. -----Constraints-----  - 2   |s|   10^5  - s consists of lowercase letters. -----Partial Score-----  - 200 points will be awarded for passing the test set satisfying 2   N   100.
