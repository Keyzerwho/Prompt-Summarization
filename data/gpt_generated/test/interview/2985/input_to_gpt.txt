Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to $1$ meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively). It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is $5$ seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes $1$ second. Find the skier's time to roll all the path.

You like playing chess tournaments online. In your last tournament you played $n$ games. For the sake of this problem, each chess game is either won or lost (no draws). When you lose a game you get $0$ points. When you win you get $1$ or $2$ points: if you have won also the previous game you get $2$ points, otherwise you get $1$ point. If you win the very first game of the tournament you get $1$ point (since there is not a "previous game"). The outcomes of the $n$ games are represented by a string $s$ of length $n$: the $i$-th character of $s$ is W if you have won the $i$-th game, while it is L if you have lost the $i$-th game. After the tournament, you notice a bug on the website that allows you to change the outcome of at most $k$ of your games (meaning that at most $k$ times you can change some symbol L to W, or W to L). Since your only goal is to improve your chess rating, you decide to cheat and use the bug. Compute the maximum score you can get by cheating in the optimal way.

There is a long electrical wire of length $\ell $ centimetres between two poles where birds like to sit. After a long day at work you like to watch the birds on the wire from your balcony. Some time ago you noticed that they don t like to sit closer than $d$ centimetres from each other. In addition, they cannot sit closer than 6 centimetres to any of the poles, since there are spikes attached to the pole to keep it clean from faeces that would otherwise damage and weaken it. You start wondering how many more birds can possibly sit on the wire. -----Task----- Given numbers $\ell $ and $d$, how many additional birds can sit on the wire given the positions of the birds already on the wire  For the purposes of this problem we assume that the birds have zero width.
