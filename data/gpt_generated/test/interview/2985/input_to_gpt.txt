Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they are metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $\{0,1, ,M-1\}$, for some positive integer $M$. Ajs draws a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them modulo $M$. What are the residues modulo $M$ that Ajs cannot obtain with this action

You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening  Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages. These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before: * hello - english * ciao - italian * salut - french * hallo - german * hola - spanish * ahoj - czech republic * czesc - polish By the way, how cool is the czech republic hallo!! PS. you can assume the input is a string. PPS. to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word ('Hallowen' can pass the test) PS. regex should be case insensitive to pass the test
tl;dr: Write a simple regex to check if the string contains the word hello in different languages. Regex should be case insensitive to pass the tests

You are given two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of the same length. You can perform the following two operations on the string $a$: Swap any two bits at indices $i$ and $j$ respectively ($1 \le i, j \le n$), the cost of this operation is $|i - j|$, that is, the absolute difference between $i$ and $j$.  Select any arbitrary index $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and flip (change $0$ to $1$ or $1$ to $0$) the bit at this index. The cost of this operation is $1$.  Find the minimum cost to make the string $a$ equal to $b$. It is not allowed to modify string $b$.

There is a long electrical wire of length $\ell $ centimetres between two poles where birds like to sit. After a long day at work you like to watch the birds on the wire from your balcony. Some time ago you noticed that they don t like to sit closer than $d$ centimetres from each other. In addition, they cannot sit closer than 6 centimetres to any of the poles, since there are spikes attached to the pole to keep it clean from faeces that would otherwise damage and weaken it. You start wondering how many more birds can possibly sit on the wire. -----Task----- Given numbers $\ell $ and $d$, how many additional birds can sit on the wire given the positions of the birds already on the wire  For the purposes of this problem we assume that the birds have zero width.
