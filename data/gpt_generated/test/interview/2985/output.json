After a long day at work you like to watch the birds on the wire from your balcony. Some time ago you noticed that they don t like to sit closer than $d$ centimetres from each other. In addition, they cannot sit closer than 6 centimetres to any of the poles, since there are spikes attached to the pole to keep it clean from faeces that would otherwise damage and weaken it. You start wondering how many more birds can possibly sit on the wire. -----Task----- Given numbers $\\ell $ and $d$, how many additional birds can sit on the wire given the positions of the birds already on the wire  For the purposes of this problem we assume that the birds have zero width.
