The $n$ items are currently arranged in a row, and Brandon doesn t want to bother reordering them, so he will partition the $n$ items into $k$ groups of consecutive items, and put each of the $k$ groups into their own box. For convenience when moving, Brandon wants to minimize the weight of the heaviest box. The weights of the boxes themselves are negligible. ",
