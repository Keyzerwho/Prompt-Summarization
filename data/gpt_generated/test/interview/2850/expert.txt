 You have $n$ items numbered from 1 to $n$. You have to group them. Each group must contain two items, and the greatest common divisor of numbers of the items in each group must be greater than 1. Each item can be part of at most one group. Get the maximum possible number of groups. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1\le k\le n\le 10^5$), denoting the number of items and the number of boxes respectively. The second line of input contains $n$ space-separated integers $w_ i$ ($1\le w_ i\le 10^4$), representing the weight of each item in order. -----Output----- The only line of output should contain a single integer, denoting the minimum possible weight of the heaviest box. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 7 2 3 1 1 3 9 5 2 Sample Output 1: 16 Sample Input 2: 7 4 1 2 8 3 5 2 7 Sample Output 2: 9
