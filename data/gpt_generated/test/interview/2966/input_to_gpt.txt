Given two strings representing two complex numbers. You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i2 = -1 according to the definition. 
tl;dr: Write program to return a string representing the multiplication of given two  strings of complex numbers. 

In number world, two different numbers are friends if they have a lot in common, but also each one has unique perks. More precisely, two different numbers $a$ and $b$ are friends if $gcd(a,b)$, $\frac{a}{gcd(a,b)}$, $\frac{b}{gcd(a,b)}$ can form sides of a triangle. Three numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can form sides of a triangle if $a + b > c$, $b + c > a$ and $c + a > b$. In a group of numbers, a number is lonely if it doesn't have any friends in that group. Given a group of numbers containing all numbers from $1, 2, 3, ..., n$, how many numbers in that group are lonely

Quido and Hugo are making a chocolate cake. The central ingredient of the cake is a large chocolate bar, lying unwrapped on the kitchen table. The bar is an $M \times N$ rectangular grid of chocolate blocks. All of the $MN$ blocks are rectangles of identical shape and size. The chocolate bar is of top quality and the friends want to eat part of it, before the rest is used in the cake.  OK,  says Quido,  let s divide the whole bar into two triangular chunks by a straight diagonal cut from its upper-left corner to its lower-right corner. We will then eat all of the blocks which have been cut exactly in half, into two equal-area pieces. You will eat one half and I will eat the other half of each such block. All other blocks, that is, the blocks which are either uncut or cut into two parts of different sizes, will go directly into the cake. Of course, we will make sure the cut is perfectly precise. Let s see how much chocolate we get to eat!
