There are N people, conveniently numbered 1 through N. We want to divide them into some number of groups, under the following two conditions:  - Every group contains between A and B people, inclusive.  - Let F_i be the number of the groups containing exactly i people. Then, for all i, either F_i=0 or C F_i D holds. Find the number of these ways to divide the people into groups. Here, two ways to divide them into groups is considered different if and only if there exists two people such that they belong to the same group in exactly one of the two ways. Since the number of these ways can be extremely large, print the count modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints-----  - 1 N 10^3  - 1 A B N  - 1 C D N

Reducing Problems - Bug Fixing #8 Oh no! Timmy's reduce is causing problems, Timmy's goal is to calculate the two teams scores and return the winner but timmy has gotten confused and sometimes teams don't enter their scores, total the scores out of 3! Help timmy fix his program! Return true if team 1 wins or false if team 2 wins

Quido and Hugo are making a chocolate cake. The central ingredient of the cake is a large chocolate bar, lying unwrapped on the kitchen table. The bar is an $M \times N$ rectangular grid of chocolate blocks. All of the $MN$ blocks are rectangles of identical shape and size. The chocolate bar is of top quality and the friends want to eat part of it, before the rest is used in the cake.  OK,  says Quido,  let s divide the whole bar into two triangular chunks by a straight diagonal cut from its upper-left corner to its lower-right corner. We will then eat all of the blocks which have been cut exactly in half, into two equal-area pieces. You will eat one half and I will eat the other half of each such block. All other blocks, that is, the blocks which are either uncut or cut into two parts of different sizes, will go directly into the cake. Of course, we will make sure the cut is perfectly precise. Let s see how much chocolate we get to eat!
