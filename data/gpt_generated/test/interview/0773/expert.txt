 Given an array a of size n, q facts about the array, and a cost function cnt(i) that counts the number of occurences of i in the array. Find the minimum possible cost of the array that corresponds to the facts.
-----Input----- The first line contains two integer numbers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 0 ≤ q ≤ 100). Then q lines follow, each representing a fact about the array. i-th line contains the numbers t_{i}, l_{i}, r_{i} and v_{i} for i-th fact (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 2, 1 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ v_{i} ≤ n, t_{i} denotes the type of the fact). -----Output----- If the facts are controversial and there is no array that corresponds to them, print -1. Otherwise, print minimum possible cost of the array. -----Examples----- Input 3 0 Output 3 Input 3 1 1 1 3 2 Output 5 Input 3 2 1 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 Output 9 Input 3 2 1 1 3 2 2 1 3 1 Output -1
