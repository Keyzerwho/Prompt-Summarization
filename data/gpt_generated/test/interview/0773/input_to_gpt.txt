Cengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named XORinacci numbers. He defined them as follows:   $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. You have to answer for $T$ independent test cases.

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom  note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.  Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note. 
tl;dr: Given two strings a and b return true if a can be constructed from string charecters in b else false Each letter in the b string can only be used once in your a string. 

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it. If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not... Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"] i.e.

Recently Ivan noticed an array a while debugging his code. Now Ivan can't remember this array, but the bug he was trying to fix didn't go away, so Ivan thinks that the data from this array might help him to reproduce the bug. Ivan clearly remembers that there were n elements in the array, and each element was not less than 1 and not greater than n. Also he remembers q facts about the array. There are two types of facts that Ivan remembers:  1 l_{i} r_{i} v_{i}   for each x such that l_{i}   x   r_{i} a_{x}   v_{i};  2 l_{i} r_{i} v_{i}   for each x such that l_{i}   x   r_{i} a_{x}   v_{i}.  Also Ivan thinks that this array was a permutation, but he is not so sure about it. He wants to restore some array that corresponds to the q facts that he remembers and is very similar to permutation. Formally, Ivan has denoted the cost of array as follows: $\operatorname{cos} t = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(\operatorname{cnt}(i))^{2}$, where cnt(i) is the number of occurences of i in the array. Help Ivan to determine minimum possible cost of the array that corresponds to the facts!
