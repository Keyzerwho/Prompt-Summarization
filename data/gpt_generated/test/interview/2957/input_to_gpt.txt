=====Problem Statement===== A newly opened multinational brand has decided to base their company logo on the three most common characters in the company name. They are now trying out various combinations of company names and logos based on this condition. Given a string s, which is the company name in lowercase letters, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string. Print the three most common characters along with their occurrence count. Sort in descending order of occurrence count. If the occurrence count is the same, sort the characters in alphabetical order. For example, according to the conditions described above, GOOGLE would have it's logo with the letters G, O, E.  
tl;dr: =====Problem Statement===== Given a string s in lowercase, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string and their occurance count. Sort in descending order of occurrence count, and then by alphabetical order to break ties. For example, GOOGLE would output G 2 O 2 E 1 

# Task Write a function named `sumEvenNumbers`, taking a sequence of numbers as single parameter. Your function must return the sum of **the even values** of this sequence. Only numbers without decimals like `4` or `4.0` can be even.  ## Input * sequence of numbers: those numbers could be integers and/or floats.  For example, considering this input value : `[4,3,1,2,5,10,6,7,9,8]`, then your function should return `30` (because `4 + 2 + 10 + 6 + 8 = 30`)

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Task: Write ``` smallest(n) ``` that will find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n (n <= 40).  E.g ```python smallest(5) == 60 # 1 to 5 can all divide evenly into 60 smallest(10) == 2520 ``
tl;dr: Write a function smallest that will find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n. n <= 40.  

L pkass is out running in the forest again. He loves running in the forest. However, there is a programming competition starting in a couple of hours, and he needs to calculate how long it will take him to get home (so that he can stay in the fresh air as long as possible). You have to help him out. The forest is modelled as a graph with $n$ nodes. Nodes are numbered $0, 1, ..., n-1$. L pkass is located in node $0$, and his home is located in node $n-1$. Two nodes $v,w$ are connected if $v+1 = w$. Additionally, two nodes are connected if they are both a multiple of some integer $K$. In this problem, we do not consider $0$ to be a multiple of $K$.
