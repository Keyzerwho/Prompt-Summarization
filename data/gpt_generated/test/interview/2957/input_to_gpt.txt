Create a function that takes a string and returns that string with the first half lowercased and the last half uppercased. eg: foobar == fooBAR If it is an odd number then 'round' it up to find which letters to uppercase. See example below.     sillycase("brian")       //         --^-- midpoint       //         bri    first half (lower-cased)       //            AN second half (upper-cased
tl;dr: Create a function that takes a string and returns that string with the first half lowercased and the last half uppercased. If it is an odd number then 'round' it up to find which letters to uppercase.  

Gildong recently learned how to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in $O(n\log{n})$ time for a sequence of length $n$. He wants to test himself if he can implement it correctly, but he couldn't find any online judges that would do it (even though there are actually many of them). So instead he's going to make a quiz for you about making permutations of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, to test his code with your output. The quiz is as follows. Gildong provides a string of length $n-1$, consisting of characters '<' and '>' only. The $i$-th (1-indexed) character is the comparison result between the $i$-th element and the $i+1$-st element of the sequence. If the $i$-th character of the string is '<', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is less than the $i+1$-st element. If the $i$-th character of the string is '>', then the $i$-th element of the sequence is greater than the $i+1$-st element. He wants you to find two possible sequences (not necessarily distinct) consisting of $n$ distinct integers between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, each satisfying the comparison results, where the length of the LIS of the first sequence is minimum possible, and the length of the LIS of the second sequence is maximum possible.

L pkass is out running in the forest again. He loves running in the forest. However, there is a programming competition starting in a couple of hours, and he needs to calculate how long it will take him to get home (so that he can stay in the fresh air as long as possible). You have to help him out. The forest is modelled as a graph with $n$ nodes. Nodes are numbered $0, 1, ..., n-1$. L pkass is located in node $0$, and his home is located in node $n-1$. Two nodes $v,w$ are connected if $v+1 = w$. Additionally, two nodes are connected if they are both a multiple of some integer $K$. In this problem, we do not consider $0$ to be a multiple of $K$.
