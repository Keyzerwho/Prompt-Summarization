$Neha$  is given a number $N$. She always looks for special thing , this time she is looking for $Special$ $Number$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Number$. A $Special$ $Number$ is a number whose product of its digits is equal to number itself i.e. $N $, and in this number there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it .Neha have to count the number of $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ . She is not so good in programming , so go and help her. 
tl;dr: You have to find a $Special$ $Number$  and a $Partial$ special number for a number N.Special Number are those product of its digits is equal to number itself and there is no digit $1$. $Partial$ $Special$ is a number having all the condition same as $Special$ except that it can also have digit $1$ in it. Print the count of the $Special$ and $Partial$ $Special$ $Numbers $for a given  $N$ .  

Dhruvil has always been a studious person and will be completing his Engineering soon. He is always kneen about solving problems and is preparing hard for his next interview at Hackerrank. He has practiced lots of problems and now he came across this problem. Given a message containing English letters(A-Z), it is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1,'B' -> 2        'Z' -> 26. Now, given a non-empty string containing only digits, help Dhruvil determine the total number of ways to decode it. While decoding you need to choose a substring of charachters and not a subsequence. Also a chosen substring should not contain any leading "0"s, but can contain trailing "0"s. Since the output can be very large print the answer as modulo 10^9 + 7 i.e 1000000007.

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.  I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n)  returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For example: ```python    nth_fib(4) == 2 ``` Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
tl;dr: Write a function that when given a number n, returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence. 

Han didn t want to study solo so he invited his friend Dominik to come over. After an eventful evening that will be remembered for a record number of solved tasks from the field of electronics, Dominik went home. To his surprise, the police stopped him thinking he was drunk. It is known that in these situations sobriety is proven by solving a series of carefully crafted tasks that test a man s cognitive abilities. If we can trust Dominik, the conversation went something like this:Policeman Something easy to begin with  What is the complexity of bubble sort Dominik That is really easy, $\mathrm{O}(n^2)$.Policeman Say the English alphabet in reverse.Dominik Trivial, zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba.Policeman You learned that by heart. Now imagine that all the letters of the English alphabet from  a  to  z  are respectively written clockwise in a circle. Begin with the letter  a  and say the letters clockwise. After each spoken letter, I can tell you to continue saying the alphabet in reverse order or I can ask you how many times so far you ve said a certain letter. Are you ready  3, 2, 1, Go!Dominik Um  a, b, c  Write a programme that solves Dominik s problem.
