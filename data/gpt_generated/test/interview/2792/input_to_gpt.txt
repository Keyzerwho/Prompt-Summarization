-----Problem Statement----- Levy's conjecture, named after Hyman Levy, states that all odd integers greater than 5 can be represented as the sum of an odd prime number and an even semiprime. To put it algebraically, 2n + 1 = p + 2q always has a solution in primes p and q (not necessary to be distinct) for n > 2. (Source: Wikipedia) In this problem, given a positive integer N (not necessary to be odd integer greater than 5). Your task is to calculate how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 
tl;dr: You are given a positive integer N.Find how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) are there such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 

Johnny has just found the new, great tutorial: "How to become a grandmaster ". The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems.  The boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked $p^{k_i}$ problems from $i$-th category ($p$ is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced. Formally, given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 
tl;dr: Given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, divide them into two disjoint sets. Find the minimal absolute difference between the two sets. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$. 

Han didn t want to study solo so he invited his friend Dominik to come over. After an eventful evening that will be remembered for a record number of solved tasks from the field of electronics, Dominik went home. To his surprise, the police stopped him thinking he was drunk. It is known that in these situations sobriety is proven by solving a series of carefully crafted tasks that test a man s cognitive abilities. If we can trust Dominik, the conversation went something like this:Policeman Something easy to begin with  What is the complexity of bubble sort Dominik That is really easy, $\mathrm{O}(n^2)$.Policeman Say the English alphabet in reverse.Dominik Trivial, zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba.Policeman You learned that by heart. Now imagine that all the letters of the English alphabet from  a  to  z  are respectively written clockwise in a circle. Begin with the letter  a  and say the letters clockwise. After each spoken letter, I can tell you to continue saying the alphabet in reverse order or I can ask you how many times so far you ve said a certain letter. Are you ready  3, 2, 1, Go!Dominik Um  a, b, c  Write a programme that solves Dominik s problem.
