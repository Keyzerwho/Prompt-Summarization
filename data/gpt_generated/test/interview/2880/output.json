Mirko, a recent college graduate, however, got lucky he is now employed as a runeologist by the Language Institute of Croatia. His friend Slavko believes runeology isn t a science and is hence angry at Mirko for believing the opposite. One foggy Christmas day, Mirko s laptop broke. Since he isn t great with computers, he gave it to Slavko to repair it. Slavko, feeling a little naughty, decided to mess up a particular file Mirko was working on. This file contains a matrix of $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Each element of the matrix is a single letter. No two columns of the matrix are equal. To have some fun with pseudo-scientist Mirko, Slavko decided he will delete as many rows as possible from the top of the table, without breaking the no-equal-column rule. ",
