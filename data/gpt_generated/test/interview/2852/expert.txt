 You are given a number $n$ and a list of $n$ numbers. You need to output the maximum expected value of the research productivity index. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input has a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$), the number of Angela’s candidate papers. The next line has $n$ space-separated integers giving the probability of each paper getting accepted. Each probability value is given as an integer percentage between $1$ and $100$, inclusive. -----Output----- Output the maximum expected value of Angela’s research productivity index. Your answer is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error of no more than $10^{-6}$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 30 50 70 60 90 Sample Output 1: 2.220889579 Sample Input 2: 6 30 90 30 90 30 90 Sample Output 2: 2.599738456
