Dreamoon likes sequences very much. So he created a problem about the sequence that you can't find in OEIS:  You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, satisfying the following constraints:  The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$  Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$, where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or (xor). After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  Since the number of possible arrays may be too large, you need to find the answer modulo $m$. 
tl;dr: You are given two integers $d, m$, find the number of arrays $a$, with constraints. The length of $a$ is $n$, $n \ge 1$  $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le d$   Define an array $b$ of length $n$ as follows: $b_1 = a_1$, $\forall i > 1, b_i = b_{i - 1} \oplus a_i$,  where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive-or.  After constructing an array $b$, the constraint $b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_{n - 1} < b_n$ should hold.  You need to find the answer modulo $m$. 

Sumit and Dhiraj are roommates in a hostel of NIT Jamshedpur,One day after completing there boring assignments of Artificial Intelligence, they decided to play a game as it was dhiraj,s idea to play a game so he started explaining the rules of the game to sumit. So the game was as follows-They randomly took a number N after that they find all its divisors.Suppose first sumit took a divisor then dhiraj and so on.The player who will be having the last divisor with him will win the game.Rohit their mutual friend,was observing them play. Can you help Rohit predict the outcome of game  If Sumit wins print "YES" without quotes and "NO" without quotes, if Dhiraj wins the game. 
tl;dr: Given a number N, return YES if it has an even number of positive divisors, NO otherwise. 

A town is often divided into zones, e.g, industrial zones, commercial zones, and residential zones. If some residential zone is very far from all commercial zones, then the people living there will have a long journey whenever they want to do some shopping, and this is undesirable. The input will consist of an $n\times n$ grid of square zones. Each zone is labeled 1 (residential), 2 (industrial), or 3 (commercial). When travelling from one zone to another you are allowed to move north, east, south or west, and the distance travelled is the number of zone boundaries you traverse. So the distance between two adjacent zones is $1$, and the distance from the zone in square $(1,1)$ (the most south-westerly zone) to the zone in square $(2,3)$ is $3$ (one step east and two steps north). You may never move off the grid. Your task is to find the longest distance one has to travel from a residential zone to get to the commercial zone closest to that residential zone.
