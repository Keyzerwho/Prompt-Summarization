 Given a grid of zones, find the distance from a residential zone to the closest commercial zone. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer $n$, $2\leq n\leq 1500$, followed by $n$ lines of length $n$ giving the map of the city zones as an $n\times n$ matrix where each entry is 1, 2, or 3 depending on zone type. You can assume that the city has zones of all three types. -----Output----- Output a single integer $d$, the largest distance from a residential zone to its closest commercial zone. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 1223 2123 2213 3212 Sample Output: 3
