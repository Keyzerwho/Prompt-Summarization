 Benni is so against his tunnel becoming ugly he d rather have them unlit completely (i.e. not placing a torch is not considered ugly). In how many different ways can Benni place the torches such that his tunnel doesn t become ugly Since this number may be rather large you are asked to find the answer $\mod 10^9 + 7$. 
-----Input----- The first and only line in the input contains the integer $1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$. -----Output----- The only line in the output should contain the number of non-ugly torch arrangements in an $n$ block long tunnel, $\mod 10^9 + 7$. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 1 Sample Output 1: 5 Sample Input 2: 4 Sample Output 2: 227
