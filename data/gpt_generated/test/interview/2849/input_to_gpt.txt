Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string.  
tl;dr: Given a random string consisting of numbers, letters, symbols, you need to sum up the numbers in the string. Consecutive integers should be treated as a single number and all the numbers should be treaded as positive integer. If no number was given in the string, it should return 0. 

We have a string of letters 'a' and 'b'. We want to perform some operations on it. On each step we choose one of substrings "ab" in the string and replace it with the string "bba". If we have no "ab" as a substring, our job is done. Print the minimum number of steps we should perform to make our job done modulo 10^9 + 7. The string "ab" appears as a substring if there is a letter 'b' right after the letter 'a' somewhere in the string.

You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. A subsequence of a string is a string that can be derived from it by deleting some (not necessarily consecutive) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. For example, "cotst" is a subsequence of "contest". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward or backward. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. It is guaranteed that there always exists such string. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4.

Most of us like playing video games. Benni prefers to play the video game Digbuild. Digbuild is primarily about surviving for as long as possible. In the game almost everything is possible. You can climb mountains, build castles, and fish, just to name a few options. The gameworld consists of large cubes, all the same size, whose corners are always in integral coordinates in three dimensional space. The player can both break these cubes (or blocks) and place blocks next to ones already there. There are also other items in the gameworld, auxiliary to these blocks. A few examples would be beds to sleep on, frames for photographs, and torches to light the world. Benni isn t a fan of building. He d much rather dig tunnels in the ground. Benni always digs his tunnels horizontally and parallel to the $x$-axis of the gameworld. They are also always $3$ blocks high and $3$ blocks wide. Benni has just finished digging an $n$ block long tunnel and decided to go get a glass of water. When he sits down again to play some more he notices the tunnels are rather poorly lit. He realizes he has to place some torches on the floor of his tunnel to light the up. Benni is rather insistent on his tunnel not becoming ugly so he has to places the torches strategically. Benni considers his tunnel to be ugly if two blocks sharing a face both hold a torch. In Digbuild you can only place one torch per block. Benni is so against his tunnel being ugly he d rather have them unlit completely (i.e. not placing a torch is not considered ugly). In how many different ways can Benni place the torches such that his tunnel doesn t become ugly  Since this number may be rather large you are asked to find the answer $\mod 10^9 + 7$.
