            "text": " Benni is playing Digbuild. Benni prefers to dig tunnels in the ground. Benni always digs his tunnels horizontally and parallel to the $x$-axis of the gameworld. They are also always $3$ blocks high and $3$ blocks wide. Benni has just finished digging an $n$ block long tunnel and decided to go get a glass of water. When he sits down again to play some more he notices the tunnels are rather poorly lit. He realizes he has to place some torches on the floor of his tunnel to light the up. Benni is rather insistent on his tunnel not becoming ugly so he has to places the torches strategically. Benni considers his tunnel to be ugly if two blocks sharing a face both hold a torch. In Digbuild you can only place one torch per block. Benni is so against his tunnel being ugly he d rather have them unlit completely (i.e. not placing a torch is not considered ugly). In how many different ways can Benni place the torches such that his tunnel doesn t become ugly Since this number may be rather large you are asked to find the answer $\\mod 10^9 + 7$. ",
