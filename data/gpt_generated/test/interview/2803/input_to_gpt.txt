Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division. To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with $t$ pairs of integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer $x_i$, such that:   $p_i$ is divisible by $x_i$;  $x_i$ is not divisible by $q_i$.  Oleg is really good at division and managed to find all the answers quickly, how about you

You are playing a game in which a group of players take turns saying animal names. The animal name you say when it is your turn must start with the same letter as the previously said animal ends with and it must not have been said previously in this round of the game.
