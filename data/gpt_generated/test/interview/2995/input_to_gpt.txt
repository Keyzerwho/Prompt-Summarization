2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Task: Write ``` smallest(n) ``` that will find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n (n <= 40).  E.g ```python smallest(5) == 60 # 1 to 5 can all divide evenly into 60 smallest(10) == 2520 ``
tl;dr: Write a function smallest that will find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n. n <= 40.  

The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. The BerTV channel every day broadcasts one episode of one of the $k$ TV shows. You know the schedule for the next $n$ days: a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le k$), where $a_i$ is the show, the episode of which will be shown in $i$-th day. The subscription to the show is bought for the entire show (i.e. for all its episodes), for each show the subscription is bought separately. How many minimum subscriptions do you need to buy in order to have the opportunity to watch episodes of purchased shows $d$ ($1 \le d \le n$) days in a row  In other words, you want to buy the minimum number of TV shows so that there is some segment of $d$ consecutive days in which all episodes belong to the purchased shows.

Walter was once a promising chemist. Now he teaches high school students chemistry, and was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. In both desperation and excitement he decides to use his chemistry skills to produce illegal drugs and make quick money for his family. He forms a partnership with one of his old students, Jesse, who has some experience with the drug scene. Now Walter and Jesse are preparing for their first  cook  (the process of making the drugs). They have a list of items they need for the cook, but they realized they have to be very careful when going to the store. The reason is that it may be suspicious to buy certain pairs of items, like cold medicine and battery acid, in the same trip. They decide to divide the items among themselves, so that each of them can go one trip to the store and buy their share of items without the risk of anyone becoming suspicious. Help them find such a division, or tell them that it is not possible.
