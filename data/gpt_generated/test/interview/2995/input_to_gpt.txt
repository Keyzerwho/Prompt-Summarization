# Task  Given a rectangular `matrix` and integers `a` and `b`, consider the union of the ath row and the bth (both 0-based) column of the `matrix`. Return sum of all elements of that union. # 
tl;dr: Given a rectangular matrix and integers a and b, consider the union of the ath row and the bth column of the matrix. Return sum of all elements of that union. 

Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests (so, fair warning, be aware that you are not getting out of it just throwing a lame bas sorting method there) with an array/list/vector of integers and the expected number `n` of smallest elements to return. Also: * the number of elements to be returned cannot be higher than the array/list/vector length; * elements can be duplicated; * in case of duplicates, just return them according to the original order (see third example for more clarity). Same examples and more in the test cases: ```python first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],3) == [1,2,3] first_n_smallest([5,4,3,2,1],3) == [3,2,1] first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,1],3) == [1,2,1] first_n_smallest([1,2,3,-4,0],3) == [1,-4,0] first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],0) == [] ``` [Performance version by FArekkusu](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aeed69804a92621a7000077) also available

You have an array A of size N containing only positive numbers. You have to output the maximum possible value of A[i]%A[j] where 1<=i,j<=N.  
tl;dr: Find maximum possible value of A[i]%A[j] where 1<=i,j<=N for a given array A of size N containing positive numbers.  

Walter was once a promising chemist. Now he teaches high school students chemistry, and was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. In both desperation and excitement he decides to use his chemistry skills to produce illegal drugs and make quick money for his family. He forms a partnership with one of his old students, Jesse, who has some experience with the drug scene. Now Walter and Jesse are preparing for their first  cook  (the process of making the drugs). They have a list of items they need for the cook, but they realized they have to be very careful when going to the store. The reason is that it may be suspicious to buy certain pairs of items, like cold medicine and battery acid, in the same trip. They decide to divide the items among themselves, so that each of them can go one trip to the store and buy their share of items without the risk of anyone becoming suspicious. Help them find such a division, or tell them that it is not possible.
