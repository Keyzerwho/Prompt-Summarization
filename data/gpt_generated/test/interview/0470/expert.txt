 Given five numbers written on cards, find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining cards. 
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains five integers t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 and t_5 (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on cards. -----Output----- Print the minimum possible sum of numbers written on remaining cards. -----Examples----- Input 7 3 7 3 20 Output 26 Input 7 9 3 1 8 Output 28 Input 10 10 10 10 10 Output 20 -----Note----- In the first sample, Limak has cards with numbers 7, 3, 7, 3 and 20. Limak can do one of the following.   Do nothing and the sum would be 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 20 = 40.  Remove two cards with a number 7. The remaining sum would be 3 + 3 + 20 = 26.  Remove two cards with a number 3. The remaining sum would be 7 + 7 + 20 = 34.  You are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is 26. In the second sample, it's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak does nothing and the sum is 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28. In the third sample, all cards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum of two remaining numbers is 10 + 10 = 20.
