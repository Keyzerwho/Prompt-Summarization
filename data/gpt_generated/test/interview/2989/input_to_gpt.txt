# Story You and a group of friends are earning some extra money in the school holidays by re-painting the numbers on people's letterboxes for a small fee. Since there are 10 of you in the group each person just concentrates on painting one digit! For example, somebody will paint only the ```1```'s, somebody else will paint only the ```2```'s and so on... But at the end of the day you realise not everybody did the same amount of work. To avoid any fights you need to distribute the money fairly. That's where this Kata comes in. # Kata Task Given the ```start``` and ```end``` letterbox numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all 10 digits painted. # 
tl;dr: # Task Given the start and end numbers, write a method to return the frequency of all digits from start number to end number. # 

You are given a sequence D_1, D_2, ..., D_N of length N. The values of D_i are all distinct. Does a tree with N vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist   - The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., N.  - The edges are numbered 1,2,..., N-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i.  - For each vertex i, the sum of the distances from i to the other vertices is D_i, assuming that the length of each edge is 1. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree. -----Constraints-----  - 2 \leq N \leq 100000  - 1 \leq D_i \leq 10^{12}  - D_i are all distinct.

You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers. For instance, if we are given an array $[10, 20, 30, 40]$, we can permute it so that it becomes $[20, 40, 10, 30]$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($20>10$, $40>20$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $2$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case. Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal.

A water company is trying to provide water from its pumping station to a mansion. The company owns $n$ water stations, numbered $1 \ldots n$, which are connected by a variety of pipes. Water can flow through both directions of a pipe, but the total amount of water that can flow through the pipe is bounded by the capacity of the pipe. The water company is constantly improving the pipes, increasing the capacity of various pipes. The water company is conducting $k$ improvements (each of which is permanent after it is executed). An improvement consists of taking a pipe between two locations and increasing its capacity by a fixed amount, or installing a pipe between two locations which are not directly connected by a pipe. After each improvement, the water company wants to know the maximum amount of water the mansion could receive.
