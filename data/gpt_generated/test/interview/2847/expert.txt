 You are given a set of songs. Find a minimum length set list that meets the requirements. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $M$ and $S$, satisfying $M \geq 1$ and $S \geq 1$ as well as $M\cdot S \leq 10^6$. These denote the total number of band members and the number of songs, respectively. The following $M$ lines each contain $S$ integers per line, where the $i$-th line denotes the preference list of the $i$-th band member, starting with his favourite song and ending with his least favourite song. The songs are numbered $1$ through $S$. No two band members have the exact same preference lists. -----Output----- Output the smallest possible set list, using the following format:  - One line with an integer $L$: the length of the smallest possible set list.  - One line with $L$ space-separated integers, denoting a sorted list of the songs to be played. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 8 4 5 2 1 6 8 3 7 5 2 4 8 6 1 3 7 2 5 4 8 1 6 3 7 Sample Output 1: 3 2 4 5 Sample Input 2: 2 8 6 2 8 7 1 3 4 5 2 8 7 1 3 4 5 6 Sample Output 2: 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
