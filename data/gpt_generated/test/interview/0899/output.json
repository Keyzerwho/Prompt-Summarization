The i-th (1 i M) edge connects vertex a_i and vertex b_i with a distance of c_i. Here, a self-loop is an edge where a_i = b_i (1 i M), and double edges are two edges where (a_i,b_i)=(a_j,b_j) or (a_i,b_i)=(b_j,a_j) (1 i<j M). A connected graph is a graph where there is a path between every pair of different vertices. Find the number of the edges that are not contained in any shortest path between any pair of different vertices. \n",
