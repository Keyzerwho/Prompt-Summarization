            "text": " Naman has two binary strings $s$ and $t$ of length $n$ (a binary string is a string which only consists of the characters \"0\" and \"1\"). He wants to convert $s$ into $t$ using the following operation as few times as possible. In one operation, he can choose any subsequence of $s$ and rotate it clockwise once. For example, if $s = 1\\textbf{1}101\\textbf{00}$, he can choose a subsequence corresponding to indices ($1$-based) $\\{2, 6, 7 \\}$ and rotate them clockwise. The resulting string would then be $s = 1\\textbf{0}101\\textbf{10}$. A string $a$ is said to be a subsequence of string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters. To perform a clockwise rotation on a sequence $c$ of size $k$ is to perform an operation which sets $c_1:=c_k, c_2:=c_1, c_3:=c_2, \\ldots, c_k:=c_{k-1}$ simultaneously. Determine the minimum number of operations Naman has to perform to convert $s$ into $t$ or say that it is impossible. ",
