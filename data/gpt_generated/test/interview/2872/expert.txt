 You are given an array of integers. You can permute its integers. You want to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Find the maximal number of such integers. 
-----Input----- On the first line, today’s date. The date consists of two parts, separated by space. The first part is in an integer (the day of the month) $d$, with $1\leq d\leq 31$. The second part is the name of the month, abbreviated as JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, or DEC. On the second line, the name of the day on 1 January of the current year, abbreviated as MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN. -----Output----- Output a single line: The four letters TGIF, abbreviating “Thank God it’s Friday” if today is certainly Friday. The two words not sure if today might be Friday, depending on if this year has a 29th of February. The emoticon :( if today is certainly not Friday. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 10 OCT MON Sample Output 1: :( Sample Input 2: 2 JAN THU Sample Output 2: TGIF
