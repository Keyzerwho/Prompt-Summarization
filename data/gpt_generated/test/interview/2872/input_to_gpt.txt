Chef recently saw the movie Matrix. He loved the movie overall but he didn't agree with some things in it. Particularly he didn't agree with the bald boy when he declared - There is no spoon. Being a chef, he understands the importance of the spoon and realizes that the universe can't survive without it. Furthermore, he is sure there is a spoon; he saw it in his kitchen this morning. So he has set out to prove the bald boy is wrong and find a spoon in the matrix. He has even obtained a digital map already. Can you help him  Formally you're given a matrix of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. Your job is to find out if the word "Spoon" occurs somewhere in the matrix or not. A word is said to be occurred in the matrix if it is presented in some row from left to right or in some column from top to bottom. Note that match performed has to be case insensitive.  
tl;dr: Given a two dimensional metrix of Latin letters, determine if the word "spoon" (case insensitive) appears in the matrix. 

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between easy and hard versions is the constraint of $m$. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved. Chiori loves dolls and now she is going to decorate her bedroom![Image]  As a doll collector, Chiori has got $n$ dolls. The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i < 2^m$, $m$ is given). Chiori wants to pick some (maybe zero) dolls for the decoration, so there are $2^n$ different picking ways. Let $x$ be the bitwise-xor-sum of values of dolls Chiori picks (in case Chiori picks no dolls $x = 0$). The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$. More formally, it is also equal to the number of indices $0 \leq i < m$, such that $\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \right\rfloor$ is odd. Tell her the number of picking ways with value $i$ for each integer $i$ from $0$ to $m$. Due to the answers can be very huge, print them by modulo $998\,244\,353$.

Create a function that takes a string and returns that string with the first half lowercased and the last half uppercased. eg: foobar == fooBAR If it is an odd number then 'round' it up to find which letters to uppercase. See example below.     sillycase("brian")       //         --^-- midpoint       //         bri    first half (lower-cased)       //            AN second half (upper-cased

Friday is the highlight of B rge and  se s life. They can meet up with their buddies in the ITU Friday bar and discuss anything they want: the weather, sports, favourite editors, politics, religion, and gossip about celebrities. Life can be good. Unfortunately, they don t know which day of the week it is! They ve woken up in a strange apartment, phones missing, and with little memory of the recent past. Which day is it  Which year is it even  After some searching, they establish today s date, because the calendar on the wall displays it. Also,  se has found the remains of an old newspaper from 1 January in her handbag, which has that weekday printed on the front page. Help B rge and  se figure out if today is Friday.
