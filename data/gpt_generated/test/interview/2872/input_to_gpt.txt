Arkady plays Gardenscapes a lot. Arkady wants to build two new fountains. There are n available fountains, for each fountain its beauty and cost are known. There are two types of money in the game: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed. Help Arkady to find two fountains with maximum total beauty so that he can buy both at the same time.

You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers. For instance, if we are given an array $[10, 20, 30, 40]$, we can permute it so that it becomes $[20, 40, 10, 30]$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($20>10$, $40>20$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $2$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case. Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal.

Friday is the highlight of B rge and  se s life. They can meet up with their buddies in the ITU Friday bar and discuss anything they want: the weather, sports, favourite editors, politics, religion, and gossip about celebrities. Life can be good. Unfortunately, they don t know which day of the week it is! They ve woken up in a strange apartment, phones missing, and with little memory of the recent past. Which day is it  Which year is it even  After some searching, they establish today s date, because the calendar on the wall displays it. Also,  se has found the remains of an old newspaper from 1 January in her handbag, which has that weekday printed on the front page. Help B rge and  se figure out if today is Friday.
