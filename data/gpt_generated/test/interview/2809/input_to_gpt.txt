You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. Find the maximum possible value of $a_{i} \operatorname{mod} a_{j}$ (integer remainder of a_{i} divided by a_{j}), where 1   i, j   n and a_{i}   a_{j}.

The objective of this Kata is to write a function that creates a dictionary of factors for a range of numbers. The key for each list in the dictionary should be the number. The list associated with each key should possess the factors for the number. If a number possesses no factors (only 1 and the number itself), the list for the key should be `['None']` The function possesses two arguments (`n` and `m`). Where `n` is the starting number and `m` is the ending number. For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``
tl;dr: Given starting number and the ending number, creates a dictionary of factors for all numbers. If a number possesses no factors , the list for the key should be `['None']` For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``

You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number. Now, we define a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.  Given a set of pairs, find the length longest chain which can be formed. You needn't use up all the given pairs. You can select pairs in any order. 
tl;dr: You are given n pairs of numbers where the first number is always smaller than the second number in a pair. A chain if formed when a pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if and only if b < c. Find the length of longest chain which can be formed.  

Consider a very large number $R$ in a compressed format. It is compressed as a binary string $s$, and an integer $k$. Start with the empty string, and append $s$ to it $k$ times to get the binary representation of $R$. The string $s$ is guaranteed to have a leading $1$. Now, with $R$, solve the following problem: How many sets of $n$ distinct integers are there such that each integer is between 0 and $R-1$, inclusive, and the XOR of all those integers is equal to zero  Since this number can get very large, return it modulo $10^{9}+7$. As a reminder, XOR is Exclusive Or. The XOR of two numbers is done bitwise. Using $\oplus $ for XOR:\[ 0\oplus 0=0 \]\[ 0\oplus 1=1 \]\[ 1\oplus 0=1 \]\[ 1\oplus 1=0 \] XOR is associative, so $a\oplus (b\oplus c) = (a\oplus b)\oplus c$.
