Start with the empty string, and append $s$ to it $k$ times to get the binary representation of $R$. The string $s$ is guaranteed to have a leading $1$. Now, with $R$, solve the following problem: How many sets of $n$ distinct integers are there such that each integer is between 0 and $R-1$, inclusive, and the XOR of all those integers is equal to zero  Since this number can get very large, return it modulo $10^{9}+7$. As a reminder, XOR is Exclusive Or. The XOR of two numbers is done bitwise. Using $\\oplus $ for XOR:\\[ 0\\oplus 0=0 \\]\\[ 0\\oplus 1=1 \\]\\[ 1\\oplus 0=1 \\]\\[ 1\\oplus 1=0 \\] XOR is associative, so $a\\oplus (b\\oplus c) = (a\\oplus b)\\oplus c$. ",
