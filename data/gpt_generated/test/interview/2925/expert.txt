 You are given a list of songs from different albums. You need to find the best songs from this list. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 50000$, $1 \le m \le n$), the number of songs on the album, and the number of songs to select. Then follow $n$ lines. The $i$’th of these lines contains an integer $f_ i$ and string $s_ i$, where $0 \le f_ i \le 10^{12}$ is the number of times the $i$’th song was listened to, and $s_ i$ is the name of the song. Each song name is at most $30$ characters long and consists only of the characters ‘a’-‘z’, ‘0’-‘9’, and underscore (‘_’). -----Output----- Output a list of the $m$ songs with the highest quality $q_ i$, in decreasing order of quality. If two songs have the same quality, give precedence to the one appearing first on the album (presumably there was a reason for the producers to put that song before the other). -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 2 30 one 30 two 15 three 25 four Sample Output: four two
