An element in an array is dominant if it is greater than all elements to its right. You will be given an array and your task will be to return a list of all dominant elements. For example: ```Haskell solve([1,21,4,7,5]) = [21,7,5] because 21, 7 and 5 are greater than elments to their right.  solve([5,4,3,2,1]) = [5,4,3,2,1] Notice that the last element is always included. ``` More examples in the test cases. Good luck

Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division. To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with $t$ pairs of integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer $x_i$, such that:   $p_i$ is divisible by $x_i$;  $x_i$ is not divisible by $q_i$.  Oleg is really good at division and managed to find all the answers quickly, how about you

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.  I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n)  returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For example: ```python    nth_fib(4) == 2 ``` Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence. For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
tl;dr: Write a function that when given a number n, returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence. 

The hit new RPG mobile game Curveknights was recently released and Yraglac has been absolutely obsessed with it. Yraglac has been trying to farm materials for hours on end so he can promote his units but has suddenly realized that he has forgotten about an integral system that might speed this up: the crafting system! Some higher tier materials can be crafted by combining lower tier ones. Yraglac has a list of materials that he needs, but would also like to know how many lower tier materials he would need if he wanted to take advantage of the crafting recipes. As it turns out, some of those lower tier materials might also be craftable with even lower tier materials and so on. Yraglac would like to know the numbers for each of these. For example, suppose Yraglac needed $3$ Sugar Boxes. Crafting one of these requires $2$ Sugar Packs, $1$ Iron Chunk, and $1$ Magnesium Ore. You can also craft $1$ Iron Chunk using $3$ Iron Ores. Then Yraglac s total list of materials would be $3$ Sugar Boxes, $6$ Sugar Packs, $3$ Iron Chunks, $3$ Magnesium Ore, and $9$ Iron Ores. Given how many of each material Yraglac wants, can you find out how many of each Yraglac would need to craft them
