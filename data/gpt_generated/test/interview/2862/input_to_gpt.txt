Bike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is such maximum element x_{j}, that the following inequality holds: $x_{j} \neq \operatorname{max}_{i = 1}^{k} x_{i}$. The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence. You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (n > 1). Let's denote sequence s_{l}, s_{l} + 1, ..., s_{r} as s[l..r] (1   l < r   n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r]. Note that as all numbers in sequence s are distinct, all the given definitions make sence. 
tl;dr: The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence. You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (n > 1). Let's denote sequence s_{l}, s_{l} + 1, ..., s_{r} as s[l..r] (1   l < r   n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r]. All numbers in sequence s are distinct. 

Alice's school is planning to take some students from her class on a field trip. Alice is really excited about it. There are a total of S students in her class. But due to budget constraints, the school is planning to take only N students for the trip. These students will be picked randomly. And each student has equal chance of being picked. Alice's friend circle has M students including her. Though she is excited about the field trip, she will enjoy it only if there are atleast K of her friends with her on the trip. She is wondering what are the chances of that happening. She needs your help. Tell her the probability that she will enjoy given that she goes on the trip. 
tl;dr: Only N items can be chosen randomly from a total of S items. You need M item including your one personal item. If there are atleast K item which are required and one your own item. What is the probability that you will purchase your K item with your one personal item. 

The hit new RPG mobile game Curveknights was recently released and Yraglac has been absolutely obsessed with it. Yraglac has been trying to farm materials for hours on end so he can promote his units but has suddenly realized that he has forgotten about an integral system that might speed this up: the crafting system! Some higher tier materials can be crafted by combining lower tier ones. Yraglac has a list of materials that he needs, but would also like to know how many lower tier materials he would need if he wanted to take advantage of the crafting recipes. As it turns out, some of those lower tier materials might also be craftable with even lower tier materials and so on. Yraglac would like to know the numbers for each of these. For example, suppose Yraglac needed $3$ Sugar Boxes. Crafting one of these requires $2$ Sugar Packs, $1$ Iron Chunk, and $1$ Magnesium Ore. You can also craft $1$ Iron Chunk using $3$ Iron Ores. Then Yraglac s total list of materials would be $3$ Sugar Boxes, $6$ Sugar Packs, $3$ Iron Chunks, $3$ Magnesium Ore, and $9$ Iron Ores. Given how many of each material Yraglac wants, can you find out how many of each Yraglac would need to craft them
