 You have a list of materials that you need to craft. You can craft some of the materials using other materials. You need to know how many of each material you need to craft. 
-----Inputs----- The first line contains two space separated $2 \leq N \leq 50$, the number of materials and $N-1 \leq M \leq \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$, the number of crafting dependencies. The second line contains $N$ space seperated integers describing the amount of each material Yraglac wants. The $a_ i$-th integer specifies the amount of the $i$-th material Yraglac wants where $0 \leq a_ i \leq 3$. Each of the following $M$ lines contains three space seperated integers: $0 \leq u, v < N$, and $1 \leq w \leq 3$ indicating there is a recipe that takes $w$ quantities of material $u$ to produce one material $v$. It is guaranteed that each $u, v$ pair will be unique, and that there will never be any cycles in the crafting recipes. -----Outputs----- On a single line output the amount of materials Yraglac needs. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 5 4 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 3 1 4 1 2 4 1 3 4 2 Sample Output 1: 9 3 3 6 3 Sample Input 2: 6 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 3 1 4 3 2 5 1 3 5 1 4 5 1 Sample Output 2: 9 9 3 3 3 3
