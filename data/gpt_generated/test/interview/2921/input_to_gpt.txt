Bike loves looking for the second maximum element in the sequence. The second maximum element in the sequence of distinct numbers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is such maximum element x_{j}, that the following inequality holds: $x_{j} \neq \operatorname{max}_{i = 1}^{k} x_{i}$. The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence. You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (n > 1). Let's denote sequence s_{l}, s_{l} + 1, ..., s_{r} as s[l..r] (1   l < r   n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r]. Note that as all numbers in sequence s are distinct, all the given definitions make sence. 
tl;dr: The lucky number of the sequence of distinct positive integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{k} (k > 1) is the number that is equal to the bitwise excluding OR of the maximum element of the sequence and the second maximum element of the sequence. You've got a sequence of distinct positive integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (n > 1). Let's denote sequence s_{l}, s_{l} + 1, ..., s_{r} as s[l..r] (1   l < r   n). Your task is to find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r]. All numbers in sequence s are distinct. 

Zonal Computing Olympiad 2013, 10 Nov 2012 N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N   (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches. For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows: Match Team A Team B Ad revenue 1 1 2 7  2 1 3 0  3 1 4 2  4 2 3 7  5 2 4 5  6 3 4 2  Thus the total advertising revenue is 23. 
tl;dr: You are given N teams which can play with each exactly one time.Each team is assigned a strength as a positive integer.Find the sum of all the absolute difference between the strengths of all the possible two matches. 

Genos recently installed the game Zuma on his phone. In Zuma there exists a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal of the game is to destroy all the gemstones in the line as quickly as possible. In one second, Genos is able to choose exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line  Let us remind, that the string (or substring) is called palindrome, if it reads same backwards or forward. In our case this means the color of the first gemstone is equal to the color of the last one, the color of the second gemstone is equal to the color of the next to last and so on.

The University of Lagado is organising events for the upcoming Fresher s week and has been told   much to the surprise of its staff   that some of the undergraduates may enjoy a beer tasting. While sourcing a wide variety of drinks for the students to taste, the university realised that in the interests of safety there should be a limit on the alcohol consumption of any student, enforced by a strict limit on the amount any individual is allowed to spend. In common with many popular establishments, the drinks with varying strengths are served in varying amounts: Either a litre, a half litre or a third of a litre to limit possible intoxication. $1\% $ of a litre at $100\% $ strength equals one unit of alcohol. The students are looking forward to the event, but in order to make the most of their money and still be bright-eyed and bushy tailed for the first week of morning lectures, they don t wish to get too drunk. How can the students spend all their money and consume in full their self-imposed alcohol limit for the night
