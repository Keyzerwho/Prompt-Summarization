You are given a graph consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. It is not guaranteed that the given graph is connected. Some edges are already directed and you can't change their direction. Other edges are undirected and you have to choose some direction for all these edges. You have to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic (i.e. the graph with all edges directed and having no directed cycles). Note that you have to direct all undirected edges. You have to answer $t$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: You are given a graph which might have undirected edges. You need to direct undirected edges in such a way that the resulting graph is directed and acyclic. 

*This kata is inspired by [Project Euler Problem #387](https://projecteuler.net/problem=387)* --- A [Harshad number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number) (or Niven number) is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits. A *right truncatable Harshad number* is any Harshad number that, when recursively right-truncated, results in a Harshad number at each truncation. By definition, 1-digit numbers are **not** right truncatable Harshad numbers. For example `201` (which is a Harshad number) yields `20`, then `2` when right-truncated, which are all Harshad numbers. Thus `201` is a *right truncatable Harshad number*. ## Your task Given a range of numbers (`(a, b)`, both included), return the list of right truncatable Harshad numbers in this range. ```if-not:javascript

The University of Lagado is organising events for the upcoming Fresher s week and has been told   much to the surprise of its staff   that some of the undergraduates may enjoy a beer tasting. While sourcing a wide variety of drinks for the students to taste, the university realised that in the interests of safety there should be a limit on the alcohol consumption of any student, enforced by a strict limit on the amount any individual is allowed to spend. In common with many popular establishments, the drinks with varying strengths are served in varying amounts: Either a litre, a half litre or a third of a litre to limit possible intoxication. $1\% $ of a litre at $100\% $ strength equals one unit of alcohol. The students are looking forward to the event, but in order to make the most of their money and still be bright-eyed and bushy tailed for the first week of morning lectures, they don t wish to get too drunk. How can the students spend all their money and consume in full their self-imposed alcohol limit for the night
