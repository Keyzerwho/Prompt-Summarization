 You are given a list of drinks with varying strengths. The students are looking forward to the event, but in order to make the most of their money and still be bright-eyed and bushy tailed for the first week of morning lectures, they don t wish to get too drunk. How can the students spend all their money and consume in full their self-imposed alcohol limit for the night 
-----Input-----  - One line containing three numbers:  - $m$ ($0.00 \le m \le 10.00$), the amount of money they can spend to two decimal places;  - $u$ ($0.0 \le u \le 20.0$), the number of units they aim to drink to one decimal place;  - $d$ ($1 \le d \le 8$), the number of different drinks available.  - Another $d$ lines, each containing:  - up to $20$ lowercase latin letters (the name of the drink);  - an integer between $0$ and $100$ (its strength as a percentage);  - its size (either ‘$1/1$’ for a litre, ‘$1/2$’ for a half or ‘$1/3$’ for a third);  - a real number to two decimal places; its cost. Name, strength, price and cost will be separated by spaces. -----Output----- If the students’ aims are possible, write one or more lines, each listing the name of the drink purchased followed by the positive integer count of how many drinks of that type were bought. If there are several solutions, output any. Otherwise, output a single line containing the word IMPOSSIBLE. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 10.00 9.0 2 fire 2 1/1 4.00 water 10 1/2 2.00 Sample Output: fire 2 water 1
