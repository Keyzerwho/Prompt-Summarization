            "text": " The University of Lagado is organising events for the upcoming Fresher s week and has been told that some of the undergraduates may enjoy a beer tasting. While sourcing a wide variety of drinks for the students to taste, the university realised that in the interests of safety there should be a limit on the alcohol consumption of any student, enforced by a strict limit on the amount any individual is allowed to spend. In common with many popular establishments, the drinks with varying strengths are served in varying amounts: Either a litre, a half litre or a third of a litre to limit possible intoxication. $1\\% $ of a litre at $100\\% $ strength equals one unit of alcohol. The students are looking forward to the event, but in order to make the most of their money and still be bright-eyed and bushy tailed for the first week of morning lectures, they don t wish to get too drunk. How can the students spend all their money and consume in full their self-imposed alcohol limit for the night? ## ",
