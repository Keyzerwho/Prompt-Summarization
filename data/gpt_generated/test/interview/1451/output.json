Let us remind you that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation only contains lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Roma's got n positive integers. He wonders, how many of those integers have not more than k lucky digits. Help him, write the program that solves the problem. \n",
