You are given $n$ arrays that can have different sizes. You also have a table with $w$ columns and $n$ rows. The $i$-th array is placed horizontally in the $i$-th row. You can slide each array within its row as long as it occupies several consecutive cells and lies completely inside the table. You need to find the maximum sum of the integers in the $j$-th column for each $j$ from $1$ to $w$ independently.  [Image] Optimal placements for columns $1$, $2$ and $3$ are shown on the pictures from left to right.  Note that you can exclude any array out of a column provided it remains in the window. In this case its value is considered to be zero.

Johnny has just found the new, great tutorial: "How to become a grandmaster ". The tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you have to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder problems.  The boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they cover. He has picked $p^{k_i}$ problems from $i$-th category ($p$ is his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience condition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy tasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has to decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him assign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced. Formally, given $n$ numbers $p^{k_i}$, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$.

Roma (a popular Russian name that means 'Roman') loves the Little Lvov Elephant's lucky numbers. Let us remind you that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation only contains lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Roma's got n positive integers. He wonders, how many of those integers have not more than k lucky digits  Help him, write the program that solves the problem.
