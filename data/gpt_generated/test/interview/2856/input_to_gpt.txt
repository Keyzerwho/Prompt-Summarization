Write a program to obtain a number $(N)$ from the user and display whether the number is a one digit number, 2 digit number, 3 digit number or more than 3 digit number 
tl;dr: Display whether the number $(N)$ obtained from user is a one digit number, 2 digit number, 3 digit number or more than 3 digit number 

# Invalid Login - Bug Fixing #11 Oh NO! Timmy has moved divisions... but now he's in the field of security. Timmy, being the top coder he is, has allowed some bad code through. You must help Timmy and filter out any injected code! ## Task Your task is simple, search the password string for any injected code (Injected code is any thing that would be used to exploit flaws in the current code, so basically anything that contains `||` or `//`) if you find any you must return `"Wrong username or password!"` because no one likes someone trying to cheat their way in! ## Preloaded You will be given a preloaded class called `Database` with a method `login` this takes two parameters `username` and `password`. This is a generic login function which will check the database for the user it will return either `'Successfully Logged in!'` if it passes the test or `'Wrong username or password!'` if either the password is wrong or username does not exist. ## Usage ```python database = Database() database.login('Timmy', 'password') ``

How many days are we represented in a foreign country  My colleagues make business trips to a foreign country. We must find the number of days our company is represented in a country. Every day that one or more colleagues are present in the country is a day that the company is represented. A single day cannot count for more than one day. Write a function that recieves a list of pairs and returns the number of days that the company is represented in the foreign country. The first number of the pair is the number of the day of arrival and the second number of the pair is the day of departure of someone who travels, i.e. 1 january is number 1 and 31 of december is 365.

Biologists have discovered a strange DNA molecule, best described as a sequence of $N$ characters from the set $\{ A, B\} $. An unlikely sequence of mutations has resulted in a DNA strand consisting only of $A$ s. Biologists found that very odd, so they began studying the mutations in greater detail. They discovered two types of mutations. One type results in changing any single character of the sequence ($A \rightarrow B$ or $B \rightarrow A$). The second type changes a whole prefix of the sequence, specifically replacing all characters in positions from $1$ to $K$ (for some $K$ between $1$ and $N$, inclusive) with the other character ($A$ with $B$, $B$ with $A$). Compute the least possible number of mutations that could convert the starting molecule to its end state (containing only $A$ characters). Mutations can occur in any order.
