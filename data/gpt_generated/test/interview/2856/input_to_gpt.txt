The objective of this Kata is to write a function that creates a dictionary of factors for a range of numbers. The key for each list in the dictionary should be the number. The list associated with each key should possess the factors for the number. If a number possesses no factors (only 1 and the number itself), the list for the key should be `['None']` The function possesses two arguments (`n` and `m`). Where `n` is the starting number and `m` is the ending number. For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``
tl;dr: Given starting number and the ending number, creates a dictionary of factors for all numbers. If a number possesses no factors , the list for the key should be `['None']` For example: All factors for 2 (`n`) through to 6 (`m`) with the number being the key in the dictionary: ```python {2: ['None'], 3: ['None'], 4: [2], 5: ['None'], 6: [2, 3]} ``

Chef and his friends are playing the game AMONG US. They all have chosen their names as numbers. There are N people in Chef s group including him, and each swears that he is not the imposter. However, it turns out there were N+1 people in the game. Now all that Chef needs to know is the name of the imposter, which is a number. Also remember that numbers can be duplicate. Can you help out Chef in finding the imposter  Input :  First line contains the value of N. Second line contains the N numbers that Chef s friends used as their names. Third line contains the N+1 numbers that people in the game have used as their names. Output :  Print the extra number in new line. Constraints :  1   Numbers used as names   1,000 1   N   1,000,000 Sample Input :  3 4 2 5 4 2 3 5 Sample Output :  
tl;dr: Given two unordered lists of Size N and N+1 find and return the additional element in the second list. Input :  First line contains the value of N. Second line contains list of size N. Third line contains list of size N+1. Output :  Print the extra number in new line. Constraints :  1   Elements   1,000 1   N   1,000,000 Sample Input :  3 4 2 5 4 2 3 5 Sample Output :  

Biologists have discovered a strange DNA molecule, best described as a sequence of $N$ characters from the set $\{ A, B\} $. An unlikely sequence of mutations has resulted in a DNA strand consisting only of $A$ s. Biologists found that very odd, so they began studying the mutations in greater detail. They discovered two types of mutations. One type results in changing any single character of the sequence ($A \rightarrow B$ or $B \rightarrow A$). The second type changes a whole prefix of the sequence, specifically replacing all characters in positions from $1$ to $K$ (for some $K$ between $1$ and $N$, inclusive) with the other character ($A$ with $B$, $B$ with $A$). Compute the least possible number of mutations that could convert the starting molecule to its end state (containing only $A$ characters). Mutations can occur in any order.
