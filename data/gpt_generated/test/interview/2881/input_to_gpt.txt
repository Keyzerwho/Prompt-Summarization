Dhruvil has always been a studious person and will be completing his Engineering soon. He is always kneen about solving problems and is preparing hard for his next interview at Hackerrank. He has practiced lots of problems and now he came across this problem. Given a message containing English letters(A-Z), it is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1,'B' -> 2        'Z' -> 26. Now, given a non-empty string containing only digits, help Dhruvil determine the total number of ways to decode it. While decoding you need to choose a substring of charachters and not a subsequence. Also a chosen substring should not contain any leading "0"s, but can contain trailing "0"s. Since the output can be very large print the answer as modulo 10^9 + 7 i.e 1000000007. 
tl;dr: Characters of a string is decoded using mapping as 'A' -> 1,'B' -> 2        'Z' -> 26. Determine the total number of ways to decode it.  There should be no leading "0"s, but can contain trailing "0"s.Print the answer as modulo 10^9 + 7 i.e 1000000007. 

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).   Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero. 
tl;dr: You are given an array with some bits. there three possible combinations of bits 10, 11, 0. convert array to string and find if the last charecter should be a one bit charecter or not  

Match sticks can be used to form digital numbers. The arrangement of matches that forms each digit between  0  and  9  is illustrated in the figure. You are given two sequences of digits $X$ and $Y$. There are matches that have been arranged to form the digits in $X$. Can you move exactly one match from them, so that the resulting matches form the other sequence $Y$
