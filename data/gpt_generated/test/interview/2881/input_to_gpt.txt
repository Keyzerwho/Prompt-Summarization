Jon and Joe have received equal marks in the school examination.  But, they won't reconcile in peace when equated with each other.  To prove his might, Jon challenges Joe to write a program to find all possible number combos that sum to a given number.  While unsure whether he would be able to accomplish this feat or not, Joe accpets the challenge.  Being Joe's friend, your task is to help him out. # Task Create a function `combos`, that accepts a single positive integer `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. 
tl;dr: Your need to create a function `combos` that accepts `num` (30 > `num` > 0) and returns an array of arrays of positive integers that sum to `num`. For an optimal solution, the following operation should complete within 6000ms

Chef has an array of N natural numbers most of them are repeated. Cheffina challenges chef to find all numbers(in ascending order) whose frequency is strictly more than K. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of N natural numbers. find all numbers(in ascending order) whose frequency is strictly more than K. 

You are given three sequences: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$; $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$; $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$. For each $i$, $a_i \neq b_i$, $a_i \neq c_i$, $b_i \neq c_i$. Find a sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$, that satisfy the following conditions:  $p_i \in \{a_i, b_i, c_i\}$  $p_i \neq p_{(i \mod n) + 1}$. In other words, for each element, you need to choose one of the three possible values, such that no two adjacent elements (where we consider elements $i,i+1$ adjacent for $i<n$ and also elements $1$ and $n$) will have equal value. It can be proved that in the given constraints solution always exists. You don't need to minimize/maximize anything, you need to find any proper sequence.

Match sticks can be used to form digital numbers. The arrangement of matches that forms each digit between  0  and  9  is illustrated in the figure. You are given two sequences of digits $X$ and $Y$. There are matches that have been arranged to form the digits in $X$. Can you move exactly one match from them, so that the resulting matches form the other sequence $Y$  
tl;dr:
