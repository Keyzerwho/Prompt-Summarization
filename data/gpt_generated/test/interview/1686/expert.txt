 You are given a set of IP addresses. Find the subnet mask that will make the IP addresses belong to exactly k distinct networks. 
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of IP addresses and networks. The next n lines contain the IP addresses. It is guaranteed that all IP addresses are distinct. -----Output----- In a single line print the IP address of the subnet mask in the format that is described in the statement, if the required subnet mask exists. Otherwise, print -1. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 0.0.0.1 0.1.1.2 0.0.2.1 0.1.1.0 0.0.2.3 Output 255.255.254.0 Input 5 2 0.0.0.1 0.1.1.2 0.0.2.1 0.1.1.0 0.0.2.3 Output 255.255.0.0 Input 2 1 255.0.0.1 0.0.0.2 Output -1
