 You have just bought a new house, and it has a huge, beautiful lawn. A lawn that needs cutting. Several times. Every week. The whole summer.  
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $\ell $ and $m$ ($1 \le \ell \le 10^6$, $1 \le m \le 100$), the size of your lawn in square meters, and the number of lawnmowers to consider, respectively. Then follow $m$ lines, each containing a string $n$ and $4$ integers $p$, $c$, $t$, and $r$, separated by commas, describing a lawnmower as follows:  - $n$ is the name of the lawnmower, a string of at most $60$ printable characters (ASCII $32$ to $126$) excluding ‘,’, neither starting nor ending with a space,  - $1 \leq p \leq 100000$ is the price of the lawnmover,  - $1 \leq c \leq 100$ is the cutting rate in square meters per minute,  - $1 \leq t \leq 10080$ is the cutting time in minutes, and  - $1 \leq r \leq 10080$ is the recharge time in minutes. -----Output----- Output the name of the cheapest lawnmower capable of cutting your whole yard at least once a week on average. If several lawnmovers share the same lowest price, output all of their names, in the same order they were given in the input. If there is no such mower, output “no such mower”. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 7000 4 Grass Slayer 2000,9999,10,120,120 Slow-Mowe,999,1,120,240 Eco-cut X2,5499,2,25,35 Mowepower,5499,3,25,35 Sample Output: Eco-cut X2 Mowepower
