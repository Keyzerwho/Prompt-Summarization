 Polyominoes are polyforms with the square as its base form. It is a connected shape formed as the union of one or more identical squares in distinct locations on the plane, taken from the regular square tiling, such that every square can be connected to every other square through a sequence of shared edges (i.e., shapes connected only through shared corners of squares are not permitted). 
-----Input----- One line with two positive integers $h, w \leq 10$. Next follows an $h \times w$ matrix of characters ‘.’ or ‘X’, the ‘X’s describing a polyomino and ‘.’ space. -----Output----- A $k$-power with $2 \leq k \leq 5$ copies of a smaller polyomino: Output a $h\times w$ matrix on the same format as the input with the ‘X’s replaced by the numbers $1$ through $k$ in any order identifying the factor pieces. Furthermore, if multiple solutions exist, any will do. Otherwise, output “No solution” if no solution exists. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 7 .XXXXX. .XX..X. XXXX... Sample Output 1: No solution Sample Input 2: 1 3 XXX Sample Output 2: 123
