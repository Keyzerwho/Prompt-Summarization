Chef has a number N, Cheffina challenges the chef to check the divisibility of all the permutation of N by 5. If any of the permutations is divisible by 5 then print 1 else print 0. 
tl;dr: If any of the permutations of a given number  N is divisible by 5, then print 1 else print 0. 

Igor the analyst has adopted n little bunnies. As we all know, bunnies love carrots. Thus, Igor has bought a carrot to be shared between his bunnies. Igor wants to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus he wants to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. Igor wants to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. He wants to make sure that all n pieces have the same area. Can you help Igor determine where to cut the carrot so that each piece have equal area   [Image] Illustration to the first example.  
tl;dr: You have n bunnies. You have bought a carrot to be shared between these bunnies. You want to treat all the bunnies equally, and thus want to cut the carrot into n pieces of equal area.  Formally, the carrot can be viewed as an isosceles triangle with base length equal to 1 and height equal to h. You want to make n - 1 cuts parallel to the base to cut the carrot into n pieces. Make sure that all n pieces have the same area. 

You are given an array of integers. Vasya can permute (change order) its integers. He wants to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Help Vasya find the maximal number of such integers. For instance, if we are given an array $[10, 20, 30, 40]$, we can permute it so that it becomes $[20, 40, 10, 30]$. Then on the first and the second positions the integers became larger ($20>10$, $40>20$) and did not on the third and the fourth, so for this permutation, the number that Vasya wants to maximize equals $2$. Read the note for the first example, there is one more demonstrative test case. Help Vasya to permute integers in such way that the number of positions in a new array, where integers are greater than in the original one, is maximal.

A polyomino is a polyform with the square as its base form. It is a connected shape formed as the union of one or more identical squares in distinct locations on the plane, taken from the regular square tiling, such that every square can be connected to every other square through a sequence of shared edges (i.e., shapes connected only through shared corners of squares are not permitted).  The most well-known polyominos are the seven tetrominos made out of four squares (see figure), famous from the Tetris  game, and of course the single domino consisting of two squares from the game with the same name. Some polyomino can be obtained by gluing several copies of the same smaller polyomino translated (but not rotated or mirrored) to different locations in the plane. We call those polyomino powers.
