 You are given a set of numbered playing cards. You are also given the maximum number of cards that can be removed from a pile. Determine whether Alice can win the game if she is the first to play.
-----Input----- The first line contains $2$ space separated integers, $P$, the number of piles, and $K$, the maximum number of cards they can start to remove on their turn. The next $P$ lines start with an integer $N$, indicating the number of cards on a pile. $N$ space separated integers follow, representing the cards on that pile from the bottom to the top. -----Constraints----- $1 \leq P \leq 100$ Number of piles. $1 \leq K \leq 10$ Maximum number of cards a player can start to remove. $1 \leq c \leq 10$ Number on each card. $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ Size of each pile. -----Output----- A single string, stating “Alice can win.” or “Bob will win.”, as appropriate. -----Sample Output Explanation----- In the first sample, the piles are the same, so Bob will always be able to mirror whatever move Alice makes. In the second sample, Alice can start by removing $0$ cards from the second pile and then $1$ card from its top. Two legal moves will be possible next, Bob will make one and Alice the other. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 1 4 1 1 1 1 6 2 1 2 1 2 1 4 1 1 1 1 6 2 1 2 1 2 1 Sample Output 1: Bob will win. Sample Input 2: 2 1 1 1 3 1 2 1 Sample Output 2: Alice can win.
