Given two strings, the first being a random string and the second being the same as the first, but with three added characters somewhere in the string (three same characters), Write a function that returns the added character ### E.g ``` string1 = "hello" string2 = "aaahello" // => 'a' ``` The above is just an example; the characters could be anywhere in the string and string2 is actually **shuffled**. ### Another example ``` string1 = "abcde" string2 = "2db2a2ec" // => '2' ``` Note that the added character could also exist in the original string ``` string1 = "aabbcc" string2 = "aacccbbcc" // => 'c' ``` You can assume that string2 will aways be larger than string1, and there will always be three added characters in string2. ```if:c Write the function `added_char()` that takes two strings and return the added character as described above. ``` ```if:javascript Write the function `addedChar()` that takes two strings and return the added character as described above. ``
tl;dr: Given two strings, the first being a random string and the second being the same as the first, but with three same added characters somewhere in the string. Write a function that returns the added character. 

Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

Alice and Bob created a new game while at the beach this summer. All they need is a set of numbered playing cards. They start by creating $P$ piles with all cards face-up and select a non-negative number $K$. After that, they take turns like this:  - A player starts by selecting one of the piles.  - Then, he removes from $0$ up to $K$ cards from the top of that pile, leaving at least one card in the pile.  - Next, he looks at the card left at the top of the pile and must remove a number of cards equal to its value (from the top of the same pile). Whoever doesn t have more cards to remove, or whoever is forced to remove more cards than those available on a pile, loses the game.In the figure, you can see an example with two piles and $K = 1$. The player to move might:   - Select the first pile and $0$ cards to remove, being forced to remove $1$ card from the top next.  - Select the second pile and $0$ cards to remove, having to remove $1$ card from the top next.  - Select the second pile and $1$ card to remove, having to remove $2$ cards from the top next. Alice has realized that Bob is very good at this game and will always win if he has the chance. Luckily, this time Alice is first to play. Is Alice able to win this game  -----Task----- Given the description of the piles with all the cards and the maximum number of cards they can start to remove, your goal is to find out whether Alice can win the game if she is the first to play.
