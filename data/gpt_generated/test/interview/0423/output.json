It's time for the final fight between human and robot that will decide the faith of the planet. The following game was chosen for the fights: initially there is a polynomial P(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n} - 1x^{n} - 1 + ... + a_1x + a_0, with yet undefined coefficients and the integer k. Players alternate their turns. At each turn, a player pick some index j, such that coefficient a_{j} that stay near x^{j} is not determined yet and sets it to any value (integer or real, positive or negative, 0 is also allowed). Computer moves first. The human will be declared the winner if and only if the resulting polynomial will be divisible by Q(x) = x - k. Polynomial P(x) is said to be divisible by polynomial Q(x) if there exists a representation P(x) = B(x)Q(x), where B(x) is also some polynomial. Some moves have been made already and now you wonder, is it true that human can guarantee the victory if he plays optimally ",
