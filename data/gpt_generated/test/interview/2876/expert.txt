 Given a function f(x) that takes in $N$ integers and produces real values, find the Lipschitz constant for it. 
-----Input----- The first line contains $N$ – the number of points for which f is defined. The next $N$ lines each contain an integer $x$ and a real number $z$, which mean that $f(x) = z$. Input satisfies the following constraints:  - $2 \leq N \leq 200000$.  - All $x$ and $z$ are in the range $-10^9 \leq x,z \leq 10^9$.  - All $x$ in the input are distinct. -----Output----- Print one number – the Lipschitz constant. The result will be considered correct if it is within an absolute error of $10^{-4}$ from the jury’s answer. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 3 1 1 2 2 3 4 Sample Output 1: 2 Sample Input 2: 2 1 4 2 2 Sample Output 2: 2
