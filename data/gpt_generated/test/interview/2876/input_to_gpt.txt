The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Now elections are held in Berland and you want to win them. More precisely, you want everyone to vote for you. There are $n$ voters, and two ways to convince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the $i$-th voter is to pay him $p_i$ coins. The second way is to make $m_i$ other voters vote for you, and the $i$-th voter will vote for free. Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For example, if there are five voters with $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 2$, $m_4 = 4$, $m_5 = 5$, then you can buy the vote of the fifth voter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you will change as follows: ${5} \rightarrow {1, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 5} \rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$. Calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend so that everyone votes for you.

Saket loves to play with strings. One day , while he was having fun with Cyclic Permutations of available strings to him, he observed that despite being scarce in numbers Vowels were really clingy.Being clingy means for almost every given string, there was a Cyclic Permutation in which atleast two vowels were together. So he decided to check this property for all the available strings to him. As the number of strings can be very large, help Saket determine whether the given string is clingy or not. 
tl;dr: Given a string return "Yes" if there are two vowels adjacent in it (first and last letter are adjacent), "No" otherwise. 

Today you are doing your calculus homework, and you are tasked with finding a Lipschitz constant for a function f(x), which is defined for $N$ integer numbers $x$ and produces real values. Formally, the Lipschitz constant for a function f is the smallest real number $L$ such that for any $x$ and $y$ with f(x) and f(y) defined we have:\[ |f(x) - f(y)| \leq L \cdot |x - y|. \]
