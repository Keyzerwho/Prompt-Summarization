Richik$Richik$ has just completed his engineering and has got a job in one of the firms at Sabrina$Sabrina$ which is ranked among the top seven islands in the world in terms of the pay scale.  Since Richik$Richik$ has to travel a lot to reach the firm, the owner assigns him a number X$X$, and asks him to come to work only on the day which is a multiple of X$X$. Richik joins the firm on 1-st day but starts working from X-th day. Richik$Richik$ is paid exactly the same amount in Dollars as the day number. For example, if Richik$Richik$ has been assigned X=3$X = 3$, then he will be paid 3$3$ dollars and 6$6$ dollars on the 3rd$3rd$ and 6th$6th$ day on which he comes for work.  On N th$N-th$ day, the owner calls up Richik$Richik$ and asks him not to come to his firm anymore. Hence Richik$Richik$ demands his salary of all his working days together. Since it will take a lot of time to add, Richik$Richik$ asks help from people around him, let's see if you can help him out.  
tl;dr: You are given a number X and limit N. You need to output the sum of multiples of X upto N. 

Write a function that checks if all the letters in the second string are present in the first one at least once, regardless of how many times they appear: ``` ["ab", "aaa"]    =>  true ["trances", "nectar"]    =>  true ["compadres", "DRAPES"]  =>  true ["parses", "parsecs"]    =>  false ``` Function should not be case sensitive, as indicated in example #2.

We have three stones at points (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) on a two-dimensional plane. These three stones are said to form an L when they satisfy the following conditions:  - Each of the stones is at integer coordinates.  - Each of the stones is adjacent to another stone. (That is, for each stone, there is another stone whose distance from that stone is 1.)  - The three stones do not lie on the same line. Particularly, the initial arrangement of the stone - (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) - forms an L. You can do the following operation any number of times: choose one of the stones and move it to any position. However, after each operation, the stones must form an L. You want to do as few operations as possible to put stones at points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy). How many operations do you need to do this  It is guaranteed that the desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L. Under this condition, it is always possible to achieve the objective with a finite number of operations. You will be given T cases of this problem. Solve each of them. -----Notes----- We assume that the three stones are indistinguishable. For example, the stone that is initially at point (0,0) may be at any of the points (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) in the end. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq T \leq 10^3  - |ax|,|ay|,|bx|,|by|,|cx|,|cy| \leq 10^9  - The desired arrangement of stones - (ax, ay), (bx, by), and (cx, cy) - forms an L.

Today you are doing your calculus homework, and you are tasked with finding a Lipschitz constant for a function f(x), which is defined for $N$ integer numbers $x$ and produces real values. Formally, the Lipschitz constant for a function f is the smallest real number $L$ such that for any $x$ and $y$ with f(x) and f(y) defined we have:\[ |f(x) - f(y)| \leq L \cdot |x - y|. \]
