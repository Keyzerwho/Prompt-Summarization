 Count the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once. 
-----Input----- Each test case will consist of exactly two lines. The first line will contain string $s$ ($1\! \le \! |s|\! \le \! 10^5, s\! \in \! [a{-}z]^*$), with no other characters. The second line will contain string $t$ ($1\! \le \! |t|\! \le \! 100, |t|\! \le \! |s|, t\! \in \! [a{-}z]^*$), with no other characters. -----Output----- Output a single integer, which is the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz a Sample Output 1: 26 Sample Input 2: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz m Sample Output 2: 182
