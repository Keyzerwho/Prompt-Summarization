You are given two strings $s$, and $t$. Count the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once. Note that a $substring$ and a $subsequence$ both consist of characters from the original string, in order. In a $substring$, the characters must be contiguous in the original string, but in a $subsequence$, they are not required to be contiguous. In the string abcde, ace is a subsequence but not a substring. If $s$ is aa and $t$ is a, then the answer is $3$: [a]a, [aa], and a[a].
