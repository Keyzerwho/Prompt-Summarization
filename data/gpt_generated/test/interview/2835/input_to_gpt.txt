Given an integer N, Chef wants to find the smallest positive integer M such that the bitwise XOR of M and M+1 is N. If no such M exists output -1. 
tl;dr: Find the smallest positive integer M such that the bitwise XOR of M and M+1 is equal to given integer N. If no such M exists output -1. 

Given positive integers N, K and M, solve the following problem for every integer x between 1 and N (inclusive):  - Find the number, modulo M, of non-empty multisets containing between 0 and K (inclusive) instances of each of the integers 1, 2, 3 \cdots, N such that the average of the elements is x. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq N, K \leq 100  - 10^8 \leq M \leq 10^9 + 9  - M is prime.  - All values in input are integers.

Reducing Problems - Bug Fixing #8 Oh no! Timmy's reduce is causing problems, Timmy's goal is to calculate the two teams scores and return the winner but timmy has gotten confused and sometimes teams don't enter their scores, total the scores out of 3! Help timmy fix his program! Return true if team 1 wins or false if team 2 wins

You are given two strings $s$, and $t$. Count the number of substrings of $s$ that contain $t$ as a subsequence at least once. Note that a $substring$ and a $subsequence$ both consist of characters from the original string, in order. In a $substring$, the characters must be contiguous in the original string, but in a $subsequence$, they are not required to be contiguous. In the string abcde, ace is a subsequence but not a substring. If $s$ is aa and $t$ is a, then the answer is $3$: [a]a, [aa], and a[a].
