Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B. (A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)   
tl;dr: Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.
