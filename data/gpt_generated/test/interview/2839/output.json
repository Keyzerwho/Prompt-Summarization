The bottom most disk should have its radius as 1. Input First line of the input contains T (T <= 1000) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000) denoting the size of the required stack. Output For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size N can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo 1000000007.",
