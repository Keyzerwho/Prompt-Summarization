VisuAlgo visualizes a number of popular data structures and algorithms in the Computer Science curriculum. Currently, it receives approximately 2000 hits/day from CS students and instructors worldwide. One new feature of VisuAlgo is the online quiz. As an example, the above figure shows a question about the classic Single-Source (Single-Destination) Shortest Paths problem in graph theory. The beauty of this online quiz feature is that the question parameters are randomized. The drawn graph G is taken from a collection of hundreds of directed weighted graphs (with their 2-D layouts) in VisuAlgo s internal database. The graph G has $V$ vertices numbered from $[0..V-1]$. The source vertex $s$ and the destination vertex $t$ are selected at random from $[0..V-1]$. However, such randomization of the question parameters may produce either a trivial question (e.g. ",
