 Find the number of ways in which a stack of circular disk can be arranged in such a way that radius of disk on the top of the stack should not exceed the radius of the largest disk in the stack by more than 1. The bottom most disk should have its radius as 1. Input First line of the input contains T (T <= 1000) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a single integer N (1 <= N <= 1000) denoting the size of the required stack. Output For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size N can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo 1000000007.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two non-negative integers $1 \leq V \leq 10000$ and $0 \leq E \leq 200000$, giving the number of vertices and edges of the drawn graph G. Thereafter follow $E$ lines, each describing the directed weighted edges in G by three integers $0 \leq u, v \leq V-1$ and $1 \leq w \leq 99$ (VisuAlgo limits the edge weight to be at most 2 characters for visual aesthetic purpose), where $u$ and $v$ are the vertex numbers and $w$ is the weight of the directed edge $u \rightarrow v$. It is guaranteed that G is a simple graph without self-loops or multiple directed edges with the same direction between the same pair of vertices. Finally, there are two integers in the last line of input $0 \leq s, t \leq V-1$. -----Output----- Print a line with the number of different shortest paths between $s$ to $t$ in G. Two shortest paths $p_1$ and $p_2$ are considered different if there exists at least one edge in $p_1$ that is not found in $p_2$. It is guaranteed that the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer data type. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 6 10 0 1 26 1 3 29 1 5 9 2 3 25 2 4 43 4 2 3 5 0 13 5 2 33 5 3 18 5 4 58 5 1 Sample Output 1: 1 Sample Input 2: 7 9 0 1 1 0 2 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 4 3 3 4 1 4 5 1 4 6 2 5 6 1 0 6 Sample Output 2: 4
