Let $T_2(n)$ be the number of odd binomial coefficients such that $0 \\le k \\le m < n$. The most useful mathematical inequality you will learn during this competition is\\[ 0.812556 n^{\\log _2 3} \\le T_2(n) \\le n^{\\log _2 3}. \\] Emma doesn't like such imprecise inequalities and would like to calculate $T_2(n)$ exactly. Can you help her ",
