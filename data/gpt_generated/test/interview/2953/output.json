In step two, the picture in the greeting emerges when the plotter connects by a straight segment each pair of dots that are exactly $2018$ length units apart. The plotter uses a special holographic ink, which has a limited supply. You need to find out the number of all plotted segments in the picture to be sure that there is enough ink to complete the job.",
