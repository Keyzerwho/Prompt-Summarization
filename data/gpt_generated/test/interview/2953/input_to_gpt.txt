Sereja has a bracket sequence s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}, or, in other words, a string s of length n, consisting of characters "(" and ")". Sereja needs to answer m queries, each of them is described by two integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1   l_{i}   r_{i}   n). The answer to the i-th query is the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence of sequence s_{l}_{i}, s_{l}_{i} + 1, ..., s_{r}_{i}. Help Sereja answer all queries. You can find the definitions for a subsequence and a correct bracket sequence in the notes. 
tl;dr: You have a bracket sequence s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n}, or, in other words, a string s of length n, consisting of characters "(" and ")". You need to answer m queries, each of them is described by two integers l_{i}, r_{i} (1   l_{i}   r_{i}   n). The answer to the i-th query is the length of the maximum correct bracket subsequence of sequence s_{l}_{i}, s_{l}_{i} + 1, ..., s_{r}_{i}. 

A simple string contains a large repetition of letters within it. This problem is related to string handling and manipulation.  An original message is sent from planet Earth to planet Cybertron in form of a string. However, the letter position and string size is not important. The number of time each letter has occurred in the string is important. So the original string which is sent to Cybertron is encrypted in the new string which comprises the letters followed by each time it has occurred in the original string. Eg- original message is- abcdabf. Then the encrypted string is- a2b2c1d1f1 
tl;dr: You have find out the frequency of letters in a given string and print it as the new string which comprises of the letter followed by its frequency.For example string is- abcdabf. Then the new string is- a2b2c1d1f1 

Given an array containing only zeros and ones, find the index of the zero that, if converted to one, will make the longest sequence of ones. For instance, given the array: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ``` replacing the zero at index 10 (counting from 0) forms a sequence of 9 ones: ``` [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]                   '------------^------------' ``` Your task is to complete the function that determines where to replace a zero with a one to make the maximum length subsequence. **

Quido plans to send a New Year greeting to his friend Hugo. He has recently acquired access to an advanced high-precision plotter and he is planning to print the greeting card on the plotter. Here s how the plotter operates. In step one, the plotter plots an intricate pattern of $n$ dots on the paper. In step two, the picture in the greeting emerges when the plotter connects by a straight segment each pair of dots that are exactly $2018$ length units apart. The plotter uses a special holographic ink, which has a limited supply. Quido wants to know the number of all plotted segments in the picture to be sure that there is enough ink to complete the job.
