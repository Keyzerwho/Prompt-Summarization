*** Nova polynomial multiply***  This kata is from a series on polynomial handling. ( [#1](http://www.codewars.com/kata/nova-polynomial-1-add-1)   [#2](http://www.codewars.com/kata/570eb07e127ad107270005fe)  [#3](http://www.codewars.com/kata/5714041e8807940ff3001140 )   [#4](http://www.codewars.com/kata/571a2e2df24bdfd4e20001f5)) Consider a polynomial in a list where each element in the list element corresponds to the factors. The factor order is the position in the list. The first element is the zero order factor (the constant). p = [a0, a1, a2, a3] signifies the polynomial a0 + a1x + a2x^2 + a3*x^3 In this kata multiply two polynomials: ```python  poly_multiply([1, 2], [1] ) = [1, 2] poly_multiply([2, 4], [4, 5] ) = [8, 26, 20] ``` The first kata of this series is preloaded in the code and can be used: [poly_add](http://www.codewars.com/kata/nova-polynomial-1-add-1
tl;dr: Consider a polynomial in a list where each element in the list element corresponds to the factors. The factor order is the position in the list. The first element is the zero order factor. 

Toad Rash has a binary string $s$. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones. Let $n$ be the length of $s$. Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers $l$, $r$ that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$ and there is at least one pair of integers $x$, $k$ such that $1 \leq x, k \leq n$, $l \leq x < x + 2k \leq r$, and $s_x = s_{x+k} = s_{x+2k}$. Find this number of pairs for Rash.

Quido plans to send a New Year greeting to his friend Hugo. He has recently acquired access to an advanced high-precision plotter and he is planning to print the greeting card on the plotter. Here s how the plotter operates. In step one, the plotter plots an intricate pattern of $n$ dots on the paper. In step two, the picture in the greeting emerges when the plotter connects by a straight segment each pair of dots that are exactly $2018$ length units apart. The plotter uses a special holographic ink, which has a limited supply. Quido wants to know the number of all plotted segments in the picture to be sure that there is enough ink to complete the job.
