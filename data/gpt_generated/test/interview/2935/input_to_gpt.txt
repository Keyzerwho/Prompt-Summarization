Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem. You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once  Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a b c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a bbc" and "babbc". Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring. Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

Fox Ciel wants to write a task for a programming contest. The task is: "You are given a simple undirected graph with n vertexes. Each its edge has unit length. You should calculate the number of shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2." Same with some writers, she wants to make an example with some certain output: for example, her birthday or the number of her boyfriend. Can you help her to make a test case with answer equal exactly to k  
tl;dr: Calculate the number of shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2. 

Peter returned from the recently held ACM ICPC World Finals only to find that his return flight was overbooked and he was bumped from the flight! Well, at least he wasn t beat up by the airline and he s received a voucher for one free flight between any two destinations he wishes. He is already planning next year s trip. He plans to travel by car where necessary, but he may be using his free flight ticket for one leg of the trip. He asked for your help in his planning. He can provide you a network of cities connected by roads, the amount it costs to buy gas for traveling between pairs of cities, and a list of available flights between some of those cities. Help Peter by finding the minimum amount of money he needs to spend to get from his hometown to next year s destination!
