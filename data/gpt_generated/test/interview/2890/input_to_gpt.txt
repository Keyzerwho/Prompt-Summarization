An element in an array is dominant if it is greater than all elements to its right. You will be given an array and your task will be to return a list of all dominant elements. For example: ```Haskell solve([1,21,4,7,5]) = [21,7,5] because 21, 7 and 5 are greater than elments to their right.  solve([5,4,3,2,1]) = [5,4,3,2,1] Notice that the last element is always included. ``` More examples in the test cases. Good luck

Vasya claims that he had a paper square. He cut it into two rectangular parts using one vertical or horizontal cut. Then Vasya informed you the dimensions of these two rectangular parts. You need to check whether Vasya originally had a square. In other words, check if it is possible to make a square using two given rectangles.

Chef Vivek is good in mathematics and likes solving problems on prime numbers. One day his friend Jatin told him about Victory numbers. Victory number can be defined as a number formed after summing up all the prime numbers till given number n. Now, chef Vivek who is very fond of solving questions on prime numbers got busy in some other tasks. Your task is to help him finding victory number. 
tl;dr: Find sum the sum of all the prime numbers which are less than the given number N. 

The city of Xentopia has a well-connected railway network. The city has $N$ junctions numbered from $1$ to $N$. There are $M$ pairs of railway tracks that exist between the junctions. Trains can travel in both directions on each track. Each railway track is labelled either red, blue, or white in colour. Tima, a tourist in the city, wants to travel from junction $S$ to junction $T$ in the minimum possible time. She has a map of the railway network that she can use to achieve this goal. Tima, being rather eccentric, has an interesting constraint for her travel: She wants to travel via exactly $k_1$ red tracks, exactly $k_2$ blue tracks, and any number of white tracks, in any order. She is fine with using a railway track more than once. Can you tell the minimum time Tima will take to go from $S$ to $T$, ensuring that her constraint is not violated
