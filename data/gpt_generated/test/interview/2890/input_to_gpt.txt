Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering. Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number. The numbering starts at 1. The format is `n: string`. Notice the colon and space in between. **

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word. Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3` etc. You need to return the highest scoring word as a string. If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string. All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid

The city of Xentopia has a well-connected railway network. The city has $N$ junctions numbered from $1$ to $N$. There are $M$ pairs of railway tracks that exist between the junctions. Trains can travel in both directions on each track. Each railway track is labelled either red, blue, or white in colour. Tima, a tourist in the city, wants to travel from junction $S$ to junction $T$ in the minimum possible time. She has a map of the railway network that she can use to achieve this goal. Tima, being rather eccentric, has an interesting constraint for her travel: She wants to travel via exactly $k_1$ red tracks, exactly $k_2$ blue tracks, and any number of white tracks, in any order. She is fine with using a railway track more than once. Can you tell the minimum time Tima will take to go from $S$ to $T$, ensuring that her constraint is not violated
