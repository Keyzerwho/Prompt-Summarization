The $i^{th}$ operation is has the following format: $a$$b$ ($1$-based indexing, without the quotes), which means that you have to make the following changes: - $S_ a = S_ a + S_ b$, i.e. concatenate $a^{th}$ string and $b^{th}$ string and store the result in $a^{th}$ string, - $S_ b$ = \"\", i.e. make the $b^{th}$ string empty, after doing the previous step. You are ensured that after the $i^{th}$ operation, there will be no future operation that will be accessing $S_ b$. Given these operations to join strings, print the last string that will remain at the end of this process.",
