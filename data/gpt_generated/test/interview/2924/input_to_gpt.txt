There are n psychos standing in a line. Each psycho is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. At each step every psycho who has an id greater than the psycho to his right (if exists) kills his right neighbor in the line. Note that a psycho might kill and get killed at the same step.  You're given the initial arrangement of the psychos in the line. Calculate how many steps are needed to the moment of time such, that nobody kills his neighbor after that moment. Look notes to understand the statement more precise.

We have a permutation of the integers from 1 through N, p_1, p_2, .., p_N. We also have M pairs of two integers between 1 and N (inclusive), represented as (x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), .., (x_M,y_M). AtCoDeer the deer is going to perform the following operation on p as many times as desired so that the number of i (1   i   N) such that p_i = i is maximized:  - Choose j such that 1   j   M, and swap p_{x_j} and p_{y_j}. Find the maximum possible number of i such that p_i = i after operations. -----Constraints-----  - 2   N   10^5  - 1   M   10^5  - p is a permutation of integers from 1 through N.  - 1   x_j,y_j   N  - x_j   y_j  - If i   j, \{x_i,y_i\}   \{x_j,y_j\}.  - All values in input are integers.

Lucy is making her road bike ready for the season. All parts have been checked for wear and tear and washed clean and she is ready to put the beauty back together again. There is only one thing troubling her. During the winter she has been to several motivational talks by previous professional cyclists. They have all talked about the importance of correct cadence while cycling. The cadence is the frequency your feet are pedaling at when you are cycling. Lucy is now wondering if she should change her gears setup before she reassembles the bike and goes on her first ride for the year. Bike gears typically consist of a set of different-sized gears on the crank (the thing connected to the pedals) and a set of different-sized gears on the back wheel. These are connected by the chain to drive the bike forward. Can you help her figure out if she can keep her current setup and still change to all gears without it affecting her cadence too much  Specifically she does not want her cadence to be increased by more than $P$% when changing to the next lighter gear. We assume that the bicycle will continue at the same speed immediately after the gear change.
