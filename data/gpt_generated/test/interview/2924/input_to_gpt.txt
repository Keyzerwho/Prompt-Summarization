Given a set of points in the xy-plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes. If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.   
tl;dr: Determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from given points in xy plane, with sides parallel to the x and y axes. If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.   

Vanya wants to minimize a tree. He can perform the following operation multiple times: choose a vertex v, and two disjoint (except for v) paths of equal length a_0 = v, a_1, ..., a_{k}, and b_0 = v, b_1, ..., b_{k}. Additionally, vertices a_1, ..., a_{k}, b_1, ..., b_{k} must not have any neighbours in the tree other than adjacent vertices of corresponding paths. After that, one of the paths may be merged into the other, that is, the vertices b_1, ..., b_{k} can be effectively erased: [Image]  Help Vanya determine if it possible to make the tree into a path via a sequence of described operations, and if the answer is positive, also determine the shortest length of such path. 
tl;dr: You want to minimize a tree. You can perform the following operation multiple times: choose a vertex v, and two disjoint (except for v) paths of equal length a_0 = v, a_1, ..., a_{k}, and b_0 = v, b_1, ..., b_{k}. Additionally, vertices a_1, ..., a_{k}, b_1, ..., b_{k} must not have any neighbours in the tree other than adjacent vertices of corresponding paths. After that, one of the paths may be merged into the other. Determine if it possible to make the tree into a path via a sequence of described operations, and if the answer is positive, also determine the shortest length of such path. 

-----Problem description.----- This problem deals with the I/O methods used in codechef.  You are supposed to print the integer in its reverse form , or in simple words, print the reverse of the given integer . For instance , reverse of  120 is 21  (not 021)  . 
tl;dr: Print the reverse of the given integer.(0 is not allowed in starting). 

Lucy is making her road bike ready for the season. All parts have been checked for wear and tear and washed clean and she is ready to put the beauty back together again. There is only one thing troubling her. During the winter she has been to several motivational talks by previous professional cyclists. They have all talked about the importance of correct cadence while cycling. The cadence is the frequency your feet are pedaling at when you are cycling. Lucy is now wondering if she should change her gears setup before she reassembles the bike and goes on her first ride for the year. Bike gears typically consist of a set of different-sized gears on the crank (the thing connected to the pedals) and a set of different-sized gears on the back wheel. These are connected by the chain to drive the bike forward. Can you help her figure out if she can keep her current setup and still change to all gears without it affecting her cadence too much  Specifically she does not want her cadence to be increased by more than $P$% when changing to the next lighter gear. We assume that the bicycle will continue at the same speed immediately after the gear change.
