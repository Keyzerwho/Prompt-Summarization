When dealt cards in the card game Plump it is a good idea to start by sorting the cards in hand by suit and rank.

But the order of the suits does not matter and within each suit, the cards may be sorted in either ascending or descending order on rank. It is allowed for some suits to be sorted in ascending order and others in descending order.  Sorting is done by moving one card at a time from its current position to a new position in the hand, at the start, end, or in between two adjacent cards.
