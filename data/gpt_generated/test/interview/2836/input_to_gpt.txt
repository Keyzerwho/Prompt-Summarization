Today a plane was hijacked by a maniac. All the passengers of the flight are taken as hostage. Chef is also one of them. He invited one of the passengers to play a game with him. If he loses the game, he will release all the passengers, otherwise he will kill all of them. A high risk affair it is. Chef volunteered for this tough task. He was blindfolded by Hijacker. Hijacker brought a big black bag from his pockets. The contents of the bag is not visible. He tells Chef that the bag contains R red, G green and B blue colored balloons. Hijacker now asked Chef to take out some balloons from the box such that there are at least K balloons of the same color and hand him over. If the taken out balloons does not contain at least K balloons of the same color, then the hijacker will shoot everybody. Chef is very scared and wants to leave this game as soon as possible, so he will draw the minimum number of balloons so as to save the passengers. Can you please help scared Chef to find out the minimum number of balloons he should take out. 
tl;dr: You are given random numbers of each of the three types of ballon Red,Green and Black in a bag. Determine the minimum number of balloons which are required to withdraw such that there is at least K balloons of same color. 

#Permutation  position In this kata you will have to permutate through a string of lowercase letters, each permutation will start at ```a``` and you must calculate how many iterations it takes to reach the current permutation. ##examples ``` input: 'a' result: 1 input: 'c' result: 3 input: 'z' result: 26 input: 'foo' result: 3759 input: 'aba' result: 27 input: 'abb' result: 28 ``
tl;dr: You will have to permutate through a string of lowercase letters, each permutation will start at a and you must calculate how many iterations it takes to reach the current permutation. 

# Task  Given a rectangular `matrix` and integers `a` and `b`, consider the union of the ath row and the bth (both 0-based) column of the `matrix`. Return sum of all elements of that union. #

Brojko and Brojana are happily married with $N$ little boys. The boys are named with distinct even integers $P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_ N$. Brojko and Brojana are expecting an addition to their family and have to come up with a nice name for the little girl. They have decided that the name will be an odd integer in the range $[A, B]$. Because they find all integers in that range equally beautiful, they have decided to choose the number which maximizes the distance to the name of the closest of the $N$ boys. More precisely, they seek an odd integer $X \in [ A , B ]$ such that the expression\[ \min \{ |X - P_ i| , i \in [ 1 , N ] \} \] is as large as possible. Write a program that determines the name for the little girl.
