Chef is baking a cake. While baking, in each minute the size of cake doubles as compared to its previous size. In this cake, baking of cake is directly proportional to its size. You are given $a$, the total time taken(in minutes) to bake the whole cake. Let cake be half baked at $k^{th}$ minute.          Your task is to find the value of $k+2$. 
tl;dr: You are given $a$, the total minutes taken to bake the whole cake and in each minute the size of cake doubles as compared to its previous size. Let cake be half baked at $k^{th}$ minute.  Find the value of $k+2$. 

Zookeeper is buying a carton of fruit to feed his pet wabbit. The fruits are a sequence of apples and oranges, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. $1$ represents an apple and $0$ represents an orange. Since wabbit is allergic to eating oranges, Zookeeper would like to find the longest contiguous sequence of apples. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of apples in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$.  Help Zookeeper find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$, or the sum of $f$ across all substrings. 
tl;dr: Given a sequence, which is represented by a binary string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ of length $n$. Let $f(l,r)$ be the longest contiguous sequence of $1$ in the substring $s_{l}s_{l+1}\ldots s_{r}$.  Find $\sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} f(l,r)$. 

Brojko and Brojana are happily married with $N$ little boys. The boys are named with distinct even integers $P_1, P_2, \ldots , P_ N$. Brojko and Brojana are expecting an addition to their family and have to come up with a nice name for the little girl. They have decided that the name will be an odd integer in the range $[A, B]$. Because they find all integers in that range equally beautiful, they have decided to choose the number which maximizes the distance to the name of the closest of the $N$ boys. More precisely, they seek an odd integer $X \in [ A , B ]$ such that the expression\[ \min \{ |X - P_ i| , i \in [ 1 , N ] \} \] is as large as possible. Write a program that determines the name for the little girl.
