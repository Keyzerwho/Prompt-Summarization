Cengiz recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers that he named XORinacci numbers. He defined them as follows:   $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. You have to answer for $T$ independent test cases. 
tl;dr: $f(0) = a$;  $f(1) = b$;  $f(n) = f(n-1) \oplus f(n-2)$ when $n > 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  You are given three integers $a$, $b$, and $n$, calculate $f(n)$. 

#Permutation  position In this kata you will have to permutate through a string of lowercase letters, each permutation will start at ```a``` and you must calculate how many iterations it takes to reach the current permutation. ##examples ``` input: 'a' result: 1 input: 'c' result: 3 input: 'z' result: 26 input: 'foo' result: 3759 input: 'aba' result: 27 input: 'abb' result: 28 ``

# Task  Vanya gets bored one day and decides to enumerate a large pile of rocks. He first counts the rocks and finds out that he has `n` rocks in the pile, then he goes to the store to buy labels for enumeration.     Each of the labels is a digit from 0 to 9 and each of the `n` rocks should be assigned a unique number from `1` to `n`.  If each label costs `$1`, how much money will Vanya spend on this project  # Input/Output  - `[input]` integer `n`   The number of rocks in the pile.   `1     n     10^9`  - `[output]` an integer   the cost of the enumeration.    #

Parmida is a clever girl and she wants to participate in Olympiads this year. Of course she wants her partner to be clever too (although he's not)! Parmida has prepared the following test problem for Pashmak. There is a sequence a that consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}. Let's denote f(l, r, x) the number of indices k such that: l   k   r and a_{k} = x. His task is to calculate the number of pairs of indicies i, j (1   i < j   n) such that f(1, i, a_{i}) > f(j, n, a_{j}). Help Pashmak with the test.
