You are given two positive integers N and K. How many multisets of rational numbers satisfy all of the following conditions   - The multiset has exactly N elements and the sum of them is equal to K.  - Each element of the multiset is one of 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \dots. In other words, each element can be represented as \frac{1}{2^i}\ (i = 0,1,\dots). The answer may be large, so print it modulo 998244353. -----Constraints-----  - 1 \leq K \leq N \leq 3000  - All values in input are integers.

# Task  "AL-AHLY" and "Zamalek" are the best teams in Egypt, but "AL-AHLY" always wins the matches between them. "Zamalek" managers want to know what is the best match they've played so far.    The best match is the match they lost with the minimum goal difference. If there is more than one match with the same difference, choose the one "Zamalek" scored more goals in.    Given the information about all matches they played, return the `index` of the best match (`0-based`). If more than one valid result, return the smallest index. #

Many phones use a nine-pivot unlock pattern. The nine pivots are arranged as a $3 \times 3$ grid, and numbered from $1$ to $9$ as shown in the figure. The unlock pattern is a single stroke that starts at any pivot and visits each pivot exactly once. The stroke goes in a straight line segment between each pair of consecutive pivots. It may pass a pivot multiple times but only the first time counts as a visit. The phone unlocks if the pivots are visited in a predefined secret order. The figure illustrates an unlock pattern of $2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 9$. Due to physical constraints, it is not possible for the stroke to pass but not visit a pivot if it has not been visited before. For instance, a pattern that starts with $1 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow \dots $ is invalid because it must visit pivot $4$ before visiting pivot $7$. However, starting with $4 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 7 \dots $ is fine because pivot $4$ is already visited when the stroke passes it again.  Consider the directional changes along the unlock pattern. The pattern may take a left turn ( L ), a right turn ( R ), go straight ( S ), or turn around ( A ) at each pivot except for the first and the last pivot. If we write down the directional changes into one string, we get a string of length seven. This is the turn sequence of the unlock pattern. The turn sequence of the unlock pattern shown in the figure is  LRRRSRL . Given a turn sequence, with some of the directional changes replaced by question marks (   ), which mean we can take any direction at those pivots, how many different unlock patterns are consistent with this turn sequence
