 You are given a grid of $N$ by $M$ patches. For each patch, you need to find the shortest distance between the Wolf and all trees. Output the shortest route. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \leq N, M \leq 500$), the grid dimensions. The next $N$ lines contain $M$ characters, each being one of ‘.’, ‘+’, ‘V’, and ‘J’. The input will contain exactly one each of the characters ‘V’ and ‘J’, and at least one character ‘+’. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the minimal distance from a tree in the optimal route. -----Examples----- Sample Input 1: 4 4 +... .... .... V..J Sample Output 1: 3 Sample Input 2: 4 5 ..... .+++. .+.+. V+.J+ Sample Output 2: 0
