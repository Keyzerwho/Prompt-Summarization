Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer. For example, the number `417` is `110100001` in binary. Reversing the binary is `100001011` which is `267`. You can assume that the number is not negative
tl;dr: Reverses the bits in a positive integer. 

Find the second-to-last element of a list.

The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, $n$ is always even, and in C2, $n$ is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with $2 \cdot n$ vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length $1$. Let's name it as $2n$-gon. Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed $2n$-gon in the square. Embedding $2n$-gon in the square means that you need to place $2n$-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of $2n$-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can rotate $2n$-gon and/or the square.

Vjekoslav the Wolf is running away from a bunch of blood hungry hunters. The hunters are smart and hide behind trees. Vjekoslav knows this, but doesn t know which trees. He would like to run to his comfortable, civilized cottage (as opposed to the hunters quite uncivilized den, yes I am rooting for the Wolf here) staying as far away as possible from any trees. The forest can be represented as an $N$ by $M$ grid. Let us mark empty meadow patches with  . , patches with a tree in the middle with  + , Vjekoslav s current position with  V  and the position of his cottage with  J . Vjekoslav can run from his current patch to any other patch north, east, south or west from him, even if it contains a tree. If Vjekoslav is standing in $R$-th row and $C$-th column on the grid and there is a tree in the $A$-th row and $B$-th column then the distance between Vjekoslav and that tree is\[ \lvert R-A \rvert + \lvert C-B \rvert \] Help Vjekoslav find the best route to his cottage. The best route is any route that maximizes the minimal distance between Vjekoslav and all trees at any given moment. Note that Vjekoslav s cottage doesn t occupy the entire patch so that patch must also be included in the route.
