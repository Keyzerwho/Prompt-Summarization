 Given a message, determine the number of steps Boris will need to encode it so that he will be happy. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $O$ ($1 \le O \le 25$) that represent the offset used for the rotation cipher. The second line contains the message to encode, which consists entirely of lowercase English characters. The length of the message is between $1$ and $80$ characters. The third line contains an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 26$), the number of times the cipher must be applied. -----Output----- Output ‘Boris’ if strictly more steps sound good than bad, and ‘Colleague’ otherwise. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 1 thequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthelazydog 10 Sample Output: Boris
