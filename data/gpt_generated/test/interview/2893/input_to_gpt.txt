You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones. Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap. 
tl;dr: For a given stone heap, you and your friend can remove 1 to 3 stones in one step.You have to take first and the one who removes the last stone will be the winner.Determine whether you are the winner or not. 

The name of our college is "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Berhampore". There is another college named "Government College of Engineering and Textile Technology Serampore". As the names are quite similar, those who are unaware of existence of both the colleges, often get confused. And mistake one with other. Given a string, if it contains the word berhampore (case insensitive), print GCETTB or if it contains serampore(case-insensitive), print GCETTS . If the string contains neither print Others. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both  Input  - First line contains single integer T, No. of test case   - Next line for every test contain case a string S  Output Print GCETTB or GCETTS or Others or Both on a new line Constraints  - 1 <= T <= 10  - 0 <= len(S) <= 100   - S contain a-z and A-Z and space only Sample Input 3 Government clg Berhampore SeRaMporE textile college  Girls college Kolkata Sample Output GCETTB GCETTS Others        Explanation Self-Explanator
tl;dr: You are given a string, if it contains the word berhampore , print GCETTB or if it contains serampore print GCETTS. If it contains both Berhampore and Serampore print Both, otherwise print others.Ignore the case.

At the legendary times of Nonsenso wars in ISM Dhanbad, there was a neck to neck competition between Barney Stinson and Sheldon Cooper. They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format. 
tl;dr: You are given N encrypted sentences whose characters are in ASCCI code. Write a code to convert ASCCI code into their corresponding characters. 

In this problem, you have to analyze a particular sorting algorithm. The algorithm processes a sequence of $n$ distinct integers by swapping two adjacent sequence elements until the sequence is sorted in ascending order. For the input sequence 9 1 0 5 4 , Ultra-QuickSort produces the output 0 1 4 5 9 . Your task is to determine how many swap operations Ultra-QuickSort needs to perform in order to sort a given input sequence.
