Your are given a string $S$ containing only lowercase letter and a array of character $arr$. Find whether the given string only contains characters from the given character array.  Print $1$ if the string contains characters from the given array only else print $0$. 
tl;dr: You are given an array to check whether the characters of given string S belongs to it or not. Print 1 if it contains else print 0. 

Write a function named sumDigits which takes a number as input and returns the sum of the absolute value of each of the number's decimal digits.  For example: ```python   sum_digits(10)  # Returns 1   sum_digits(99)  # Returns 18   sum_digits(-32) # Returns 5 ``` Let's assume that all numbers in the input will be integer values

A rectangle with sides $A$ and $B$ is cut into rectangles with cuts parallel to its sides. For example, if $p$ horizontal and $q$ vertical cuts were made, $(p + 1) \cdot (q + 1)$ rectangles were left after the cutting. After the cutting, rectangles were of $n$ different types. Two rectangles are different if at least one side of one rectangle isn't equal to the corresponding side of the other. Note that the rectangle can't be rotated, this means that rectangles $a \times b$ and $b \times a$ are considered different if $a \neq b$. For each type of rectangles, lengths of the sides of rectangles are given along with the amount of the rectangles of this type that were left after cutting the initial rectangle. Calculate the amount of pairs $(A; B)$ such as the given rectangles could be created by cutting the rectangle with sides of lengths $A$ and $B$. Note that pairs $(A; B)$ and $(B; A)$ are considered different when $A \neq B$.

You are leading a kayaking trip with a mixed group of participants in the Stockholm archipelago, but as you are about to begin your final stretch back to the mainland you notice a storm on the horizon. You had better paddle as fast as you can to make sure you do not get trapped on one of the islands. Of course, you cannot leave anyone behind, so your speed will be determined by the slowest kayak. Time to start thinking; How should you distribute the participants among the kayaks to maximize your chance of reaching the mainland safely   The kayaks are of different types and have different amounts of packing, so some are more easily paddled than others. This is captured by a speed factor $c$ that you have already figured out for each kayak. The final speed $v$ of a kayak, however, is also determined by the strengths $s_1$ and $s_2$ of the two people in the kayak, by the relation $v=c(s_1+s_2)$. In your group you have some beginners with a kayaking strength of $s_ b$, a number of normal participants with strength $s_ n$ and some quite experienced strong kayakers with strength $s_ e$.
