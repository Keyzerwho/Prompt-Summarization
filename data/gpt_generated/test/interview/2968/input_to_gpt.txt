Bohan loves milk tea so much and he drinks one cup of milk tea every day. The local shop sells milk tea in two sizes: a Medium cup for $3 and a Large cup for $4. For every cup of milk tea purchased Bohan receives a promotional stamp. Bohan may redeem 6 stamps for a free drink of milk tea regardless of the size. No stamp will be given for a free drink. Determine the amount of money Bohan have spent on milk tea, given a sequence of milk tea sizes he got in the past a few days. Assume Bohan had no stamps in the beginning and he always redeemed the stamps for the next drink once he had collected 6 stamps.

You are leading a kayaking trip with a mixed group of participants in the Stockholm archipelago, but as you are about to begin your final stretch back to the mainland you notice a storm on the horizon. You had better paddle as fast as you can to make sure you do not get trapped on one of the islands. Of course, you cannot leave anyone behind, so your speed will be determined by the slowest kayak. Time to start thinking; How should you distribute the participants among the kayaks to maximize your chance of reaching the mainland safely   The kayaks are of different types and have different amounts of packing, so some are more easily paddled than others. This is captured by a speed factor $c$ that you have already figured out for each kayak. The final speed $v$ of a kayak, however, is also determined by the strengths $s_1$ and $s_2$ of the two people in the kayak, by the relation $v=c(s_1+s_2)$. In your group you have some beginners with a kayaking strength of $s_ b$, a number of normal participants with strength $s_ n$ and some quite experienced strong kayakers with strength $s_ e$.
