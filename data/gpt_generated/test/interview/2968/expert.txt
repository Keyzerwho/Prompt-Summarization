 You are leading a kayaking trip with a mixed group of participants in the Stockholm archipelago, but as you are about to begin your final stretch back to the mainland you notice a storm on the horizon. You had better paddle as fast as you can to make sure you do not get trapped on one of the islands. Of course, you cannot leave anyone behind, so your speed will be determined by the slowest kayak. Time to start thinking; How should you distribute the participants among the kayaks to maximize your chance of reaching the mainland safely 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three non-negative integers $b$, $n$, and $e$, denoting the number of beginners, normal participants, and experienced kayakers, respectively. The total number of participants, $b+n+e$, will be even, at least $2$, and no more than $100000$. This is followed by a line with three integers $s_ b$, $s_ n$, and $s_ e$, giving the strengths of the corresponding participants ($1 \leq s_ b < s_ n < s_ e \leq 1000$). The third and final line contains $m = \frac{b+n+e}{2}$ integers $c_1, \ldots , c_ m$ ($1 \leq c_ i \leq 100000$ for each $i$), each giving the speed factor of one kayak. -----Output----- Output a single integer, the maximum speed that the slowest kayak can get by distributing the participants two in each kayak. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 3 1 0 40 60 90 18 20 Sample Output: 1600
