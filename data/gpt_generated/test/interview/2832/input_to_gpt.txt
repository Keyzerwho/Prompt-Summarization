Chef has an array of N natural numbers most of them are repeated. Cheffina challenges chef to find all numbers(in ascending order) whose frequency is strictly more than K. 
tl;dr: You are given an array of N natural numbers. find all numbers(in ascending order) whose frequency is strictly more than K. 

Chef and his friends are playing the game AMONG US. They all have chosen their names as numbers. There are N people in Chef s group including him, and each swears that he is not the imposter. However, it turns out there were N+1 people in the game. Now all that Chef needs to know is the name of the imposter, which is a number. Also remember that numbers can be duplicate. Can you help out Chef in finding the imposter  Input :  First line contains the value of N. Second line contains the N numbers that Chef s friends used as their names. Third line contains the N+1 numbers that people in the game have used as their names. Output :  Print the extra number in new line. Constraints :  1   Numbers used as names   1,000 1   N   1,000,000 Sample Input :  3 4 2 5 4 2 3 5 Sample Output :  
tl;dr: Given two unordered lists of Size N and N+1 find and return the additional element in the second list. Input :  First line contains the value of N. Second line contains list of size N. Third line contains list of size N+1. Output :  Print the extra number in new line. Constraints :  1   Elements   1,000 1   N   1,000,000 Sample Input :  3 4 2 5 4 2 3 5 Sample Output :  

Try guessing the statement from this picture:  $3$  You are given a non-negative integer $d$. You have to find two non-negative real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a + b = d$ and $a \cdot b = d$.

Pixels in a digital picture can be represented with three integers in the range $0$ to $255$ that indicate the intensity of the red, green, and blue colors. To compress an image or to create an artistic effect, many photo-editing tools include a  posterize  operation which works as follows. Each color channel is examined separately; this problem focuses only on the red channel. Rather than allow all integers from $0$ to $255$ for the red channel, a posterized image allows at most $k$ integers from this range. Each pixel s original red intensity is replaced with the nearest of the allowed integers. The photo-editing tool selects a set of $k$ integers that minimizes the sum of the squared errors introduced across all pixels in the original image. If there are $n$ pixels that have original red values $r_1, \ldots , r_ n$, and $k$ allowed integers $v_1, \ldots , v_ k$, the sum of squared errors is defined as\[ \sum _{i=1}^n \min _{1 \leq j \leq k} (r_ i - v_ j)^2. \] Your task is to compute the minimum achievable sum of squared errors, given parameter $k$ and a description of the red intensities of an image s pixels.
