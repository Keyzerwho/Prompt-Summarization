 Given the layout of a social network and an initial infection site, you need to determine how many squawks are made at some given time $t$. In the above example the number of squawks would be 2, 4 and 10 at times 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
-----Input----- The input will start with a line containing 4 integers $n$ $m$ $s$ $t$ indicating the number of users $(1\le n \leq 100)$, the number of links between users $(0\le m \leq n(n-1)/2)$, the index of the initially infected user $(s < n)$, and the number of minutes $(t < 10)$. Next will follow $m$ lines, each consisting of two integers $x$$y$, $(0 \leq x, y < n)$ indicating that users $x$ and $y$ are connected. Connections are symmetric and no two connections will be the same. -----Output----- Output the number of squawks sent at the specified time $t$. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 4 3 1 4 0 1 1 2 2 3 Sample Output: 8
