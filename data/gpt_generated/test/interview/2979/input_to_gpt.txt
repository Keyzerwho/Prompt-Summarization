The sequence of $m$ integers is called the permutation if it contains all integers from $1$ to $m$ exactly once. The number $m$ is called the length of the permutation. Dreamoon has two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$ of non-zero lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$. Now Dreamoon concatenates these two permutations into another sequence $a$ of length $l_1 + l_2$. First $l_1$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_1$ and next $l_2$ elements of $a$ is the permutation $p_2$.  You are given the sequence $a$, and you need to find two permutations $p_1$ and $p_2$. If there are several possible ways to restore them, you should find all of them. (Note that it is also possible that there will be no ways.)

Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the size n   m meters. On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a   a. What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square  It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square. Input The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1    n, m, a   10^9). Output Print the needed number of flagstones in new line. 
tl;dr: Given n, m and a, calculate the number of squares of side length a required to completely cover a rectangle of length m and breadth n. Input The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1    n, m, a   10^9). Output Print the needed squares. 

Oh no! Hackers are threatening to shut down Twitface, the premier social networking site. By taking advantage of lax security protocols, nefarious cyber-bandits have developed a virus that spreads from user to user, amplifying over time and eventually bringing the network to its knees from massive congestion. Normally users have to manually send messages to one another (squawking), but these ne er-do-wells have figured out how to circumvent that rule, and have created squawks that spawn more squawks without user intervention. In particular, any time a user gets an infected squawk, one minute later it broadcasts an infected squawk to all its neighbors in the network (for purposes of this problem we assume that each neighbor gets the squawk exactly 1 minute after the initial user is infected). If a user receives multiple squawks at any point, the next minute it broadcasts that many squawks to all of its neighbors. For example, consider the following network: If user $0$ is infected at time $t=0$, then at time $t=1$ users $1$ and $3$ get $1$ squawk each, at time $t=2$ users $0$ and $2$ get $2$ squawks each, and at time $t=3$, users $1$ and $3$ get $4$ squawks each and user $4$ gets $2$ squawks. Given the layout of a social network and an initial infection site, you need to determine how many squawks are made at some given time $t$. In the above example the number of squawks would be 2, 4 and 10 at times 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
