 You are given a two dimensional grid of squares. You are given a tree outline. You are to assign rings to the tree outline. 
-----Input----- The input will start with a line containing two positive integers $n$ $m$ specifying the number of rows and columns in the tree grid, where $n, m \leq 100$. After this will be $n$ rows containing $m$ characters each. These characters will be either ‘T’ indicating a tree grid square, or ‘.’. -----Output----- Output a grid with the ring numbers. If the number of rings is less than 10, use two characters for each grid square; otherwise use three characters for each grid square. Right justify all ring numbers in the grid squares, and use ‘.’ to fill in the remaining characters. If a row or column does not contain a ring number it should still be output, filled entirely with ‘.’s. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 6 .TT... TTTT.. TTTTT. TTTTT. TTTTTT ..T... Sample Output: ...1.1...... .1.2.2.1.... .1.2.3.2.1.. .1.2.3.2.1.. .1.1.2.1.1.1 .....1......
