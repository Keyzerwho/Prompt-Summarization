You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed. n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 
tl;dr: You are given a total of n coins to form staircase rows where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.   The output should be the total number of such rows formed. n>=0 and has the range of a 32-bit signed integer. 

You'll be given a string, and have to return the total of all the unicode characters as an int. Should be able to handle any characters sent at it.  examples: uniTotal("a") == 97 uniTotal("aaa") == 29

Write a program, which takes an integer N and if the number is less than 10 then display "Thanks for helping Chef!" otherwise print "-1". 
tl;dr: Display "Thanks for helping Chef!" if given number N is less than 10, otherwise print "-1". 

Dee Siduous is a botanist who specializes in trees. A lot of her research has to do with the formation of tree rings, and what they say about the growing conditions over the tree s lifetime. She has a certain theory and wants to run some simulations to see if it holds up to the evidence gathered in the field. One thing that needs to be done is to determine the expected number of rings given the outline of a tree. Dee has decided to model a cross section of a tree on a two dimenional grid, with the interior of the tree represented by a closed polygon of grid squares. Given this set of squares, she assigns rings from the outer parts of the tree to the inner as follows: calling the non-tree grid squares  ring $0$ , each ring $n$ is made up of all those grid squares that have at least one ring $(n-1)$ square as a neighbor (where neighboring squares are those that share an edge). An example of this is shown in the figure below.  Figure D.1  Most of Dee s models have been drawn on graph paper, and she has come to you to write a program to do this automatically for her. This way she ll use less paper and save some $\ldots $ well, you know.
