You are given an array $a$ of $n$ positive integers. You can use the following operation as many times as you like: select any integer $1 \le k \le n$ and do one of two things:   decrement by one $k$ of the first elements of the array.  decrement by one $k$ of the last elements of the array.  For example, if $n=5$ and $a=[3,2,2,1,4]$, then you can apply one of the following operations to it (not all possible options are listed below):   decrement from the first two elements of the array. After this operation $a=[2, 1, 2, 1, 4]$;  decrement from the last three elements of the array. After this operation $a=[3, 2, 1, 0, 3]$;  decrement from the first five elements of the array. After this operation $a=[2, 1, 1, 0, 3]$;  Determine if it is possible to make all the elements of the array equal to zero by applying a certain number of operations.

There are $n$ athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete   the athlete number $i$ has the strength $s_i$. You want to split all athletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each athlete must be exactly in one team. You want the strongest athlete from the first team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the second team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams $A$ and $B$ so that the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ is as small as possible, where $\max(A)$ is the maximum strength of an athlete from team $A$, and $\min(B)$ is the minimum strength of an athlete from team $B$. For example, if $n=5$ and the strength of the athletes is $s=[3, 1, 2, 6, 4]$, then one of the possible split into teams is:   first team: $A = [1, 2, 4]$,  second team: $B = [3, 6]$.  In this case, the value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ will be equal to $|4-3|=1$. This example illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams. Print the minimum value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$. 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers. You want to split the integers into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list $A$ to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list $B$. 

Dee Siduous is a botanist who specializes in trees. A lot of her research has to do with the formation of tree rings, and what they say about the growing conditions over the tree s lifetime. She has a certain theory and wants to run some simulations to see if it holds up to the evidence gathered in the field. One thing that needs to be done is to determine the expected number of rings given the outline of a tree. Dee has decided to model a cross section of a tree on a two dimenional grid, with the interior of the tree represented by a closed polygon of grid squares. Given this set of squares, she assigns rings from the outer parts of the tree to the inner as follows: calling the non-tree grid squares  ring $0$ , each ring $n$ is made up of all those grid squares that have at least one ring $(n-1)$ square as a neighbor (where neighboring squares are those that share an edge). An example of this is shown in the figure below.  Figure D.1  Most of Dee s models have been drawn on graph paper, and she has come to you to write a program to do this automatically for her. This way she ll use less paper and save some $\ldots $ well, you know.
