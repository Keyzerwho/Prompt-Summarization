 You are given a list of participants, their bets, and a random number chosen by the Intergalactic Council of Pebble Coins. You need to determine which participants won the lottery. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers $n$ and $s$, where $1 \le n \le 1000$ is the number of participants, and $1 \le s < 10^{1000}$ is the random number chosen by the ICPC. Then follow $n$ lines describing the participants. Each line contains a string $t$ and an integer $b$, where $t$ is the name of a participant, and $1 \le b < 10^{1000}$ is the amount of his bet. The name of each participant is unique and consists of between $1$ and $20$ letters from the English alphabet. -----Output----- Output an integer $k$ denoting the number of participants that won the lottery. Then output $k$ lines containing the names of the participants that won the lottery, one per line, in any order. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 5 63 Vader 3 Voldemort 7 BorgQueen 20 Terminator 40 Megatron 101 Sample Output: 3 BorgQueen Terminator Vader
