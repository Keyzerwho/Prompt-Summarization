Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.  Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group. Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way. 
tl;dr: You are given N people to be split into two groups such that given dislikes[i] = [a, b], a and b should be in different groups. You need to return true if such split is possible. 

# Task Your task is to write a function for calculating the score of a 10 pin bowling game. The input for the function is a list of pins knocked down per roll for one player. Output is the player's total score. # Rules ## General rules Rules of bowling in a nutshell: * A game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player rolls 1 or 2 balls, except for the 10th frame, where the player rolls 2 or 3 balls. * The total score is the sum of your scores for the 10 frames * If you knock down fewer than 10 pins with 2 balls, your frame score is the number of pins knocked down * If you knock down all 10 pins with 2 balls (spare), you score the amount of pins knocked down plus a bonus - amount of pins knocked down with the next ball * If you knock down all 10 pins with 1 ball (strike), you score the amount of pins knocked down plus a bonus - amount of pins knocked down with the next 2 balls ## Rules for 10th frame As the 10th frame is the last one, in case of spare or strike there will be no next balls for the bonus. To account for that: * if the last frame is a spare, player rolls 1 bonus ball. * if the last frame is a strike, player rolls 2 bonus balls. These bonus balls on 10th frame are only counted as a bonus to the respective spare or strike. # More information http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring # Input You may assume that the input is always valid. This means: * input list length is correct * number of pins knocked out per roll is vali

-----Problem Statement----- Levy's conjecture, named after Hyman Levy, states that all odd integers greater than 5 can be represented as the sum of an odd prime number and an even semiprime. To put it algebraically, 2n + 1 = p + 2q always has a solution in primes p and q (not necessary to be distinct) for n > 2. (Source: Wikipedia) In this problem, given a positive integer N (not necessary to be odd integer greater than 5). Your task is to calculate how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 
tl;dr: You are given a positive integer N.Find how many distinct ordered pairs (p, q) are there such that N = p + 2q, where p and q are primes. 

Today the Intergalactic Council of Pebble Coins (ICPC) conducted an intergalactic auction of the Neutronium Chaos Pebble Coin (NCPC). This coin, which was forged in the Ancient Coin Machine (ACM), is rumored to be the key to ruling the universe.  Due to the extremely competitive nature of the auction, as well as the odd mechanics of the intergalactic currency used (far too advanced for mere mortals to understand), the auction was conducted with the following rules:  - only one participant was allowed to make a bid at a time,  - each participant was only allowed to make one bid, and  - a participant making a bid had to bid at least twice the amount of the highest bid at the time. The first participant making a bid was allowed to make a bid of any positive amount. After the auction there were a lot of sore losers   understandably, having just lost their chance at world domination. To make the losers feel a little better and prevent possible rioting, the ICPC has decided to hold a lottery for the participants. The winners of the lottery are determined as follows. The ICPC picks a random number $s$. A group of participants is called winning if the sum of their bets from the auction is equal to $s$. A participant wins the lottery and receives a prize   a shiny Pebble Coin   if they belong to any winning group of participants. Given the names of the participants, the bets that they made, and the random number $s$ chosen by the ICPC, help them determine which participants won the lottery.
