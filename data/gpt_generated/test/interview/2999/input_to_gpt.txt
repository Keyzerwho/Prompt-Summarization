The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The only difference is that, in problem C1, $n$ is always even, and in C2, $n$ is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with $2 \cdot n$ vertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides have length $1$. Let's name it as $2n$-gon. Your task is to find the square of the minimum size such that you can embed $2n$-gon in the square. Embedding $2n$-gon in the square means that you need to place $2n$-gon in the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of $2n$-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can rotate $2n$-gon and/or the square.

Given an integer N, Chef wants to find the smallest positive integer M such that the bitwise XOR of M and M+1 is N. If no such M exists output -1.

Today the Intergalactic Council of Pebble Coins (ICPC) conducted an intergalactic auction of the Neutronium Chaos Pebble Coin (NCPC). This coin, which was forged in the Ancient Coin Machine (ACM), is rumored to be the key to ruling the universe.  Due to the extremely competitive nature of the auction, as well as the odd mechanics of the intergalactic currency used (far too advanced for mere mortals to understand), the auction was conducted with the following rules:  - only one participant was allowed to make a bid at a time,  - each participant was only allowed to make one bid, and  - a participant making a bid had to bid at least twice the amount of the highest bid at the time. The first participant making a bid was allowed to make a bid of any positive amount. After the auction there were a lot of sore losers   understandably, having just lost their chance at world domination. To make the losers feel a little better and prevent possible rioting, the ICPC has decided to hold a lottery for the participants. The winners of the lottery are determined as follows. The ICPC picks a random number $s$. A group of participants is called winning if the sum of their bets from the auction is equal to $s$. A participant wins the lottery and receives a prize   a shiny Pebble Coin   if they belong to any winning group of participants. Given the names of the participants, the bets that they made, and the random number $s$ chosen by the ICPC, help them determine which participants won the lottery.
