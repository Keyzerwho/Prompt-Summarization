Chef Vivek is good in mathematics and likes solving problems on prime numbers. One day his friend Jatin told him about Victory numbers. Victory number can be defined as a number formed after summing up all the prime numbers till given number n. Now, chef Vivek who is very fond of solving questions on prime numbers got busy in some other tasks. Your task is to help him finding victory number. 
tl;dr: Find sum the sum of all the prime numbers which are less than the given number N. 

A group of n cities is connected by a network of roads. There is an undirected road between every pair of cities, so there are $\frac{n \cdot(n - 1)}{2}$ roads in total. It takes exactly y seconds to traverse any single road. A spanning tree is a set of roads containing exactly n - 1 roads such that it's possible to travel between any two cities using only these roads. Some spanning tree of the initial network was chosen. For every road in this tree the time one needs to traverse this road was changed from y to x seconds. Note that it's not guaranteed that x is smaller than y. You would like to travel through all the cities using the shortest path possible. Given n, x, y and a description of the spanning tree that was chosen, find the cost of the shortest path that starts in any city, ends in any city and visits all cities exactly once.

Some viruses replicate by replacing a piece of DNA in a living cell with a piece of DNA that the virus carries with it. This makes the cell start to produce viruses identical to the original one that infected the cell. A group of biologists is interested in knowing how much DNA a certain virus inserts into the host genome. To find this out they have sequenced the full genome of a healthy cell as well as that of an identical cell infected by a virus. The genome turned out to be pretty big, so now they need your help in the data processing step. Given the DNA sequence before and after the virus infection, determine the length of the smallest single, consecutive piece of DNA that can have been inserted into the first sequence to turn it into the second one. A single, consecutive piece of DNA might also have been removed from the same position in the sequence as DNA was inserted. Small changes in the DNA can have large effects, so the virus might insert only a few bases, or even nothing at all.
