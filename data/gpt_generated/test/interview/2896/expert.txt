 Given the DNA sequence before and after the virus infection, determine the length of the smallest single, consecutive piece of DNA that can have been inserted into the first sequence to turn it into the second one. A single, consecutive piece of DNA might also have been removed from the same position in the sequence as DNA was inserted. Small changes in the DNA can have large effects, so the virus might insert only a few bases, or even nothing at all. 
-----Input----- The input consists of two lines containing the DNA sequence before and after virus infection respectively. A DNA sequence is given as a string containing between 1 and $10^5$ upper-case letters from the alphabet {A, G, C, T}. -----Output----- Output one integer, the minimum length of DNA inserted by the virus. -----Examples----- Sample Input: AAAAA AGCGAA Sample Output: 3
