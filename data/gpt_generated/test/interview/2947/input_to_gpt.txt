The USA Construction Operation (USACO) recently ordered Farmer John to arrange a row of $n$ haybale piles on the farm. The $i$-th pile contains $a_i$ haybales.  However, Farmer John has just left for vacation, leaving Bessie all on her own. Every day, Bessie the naughty cow can choose to move one haybale in any pile to an adjacent pile. Formally, in one day she can choose any two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$) such that $|i-j|=1$ and $a_i>0$ and apply $a_i = a_i - 1$, $a_j = a_j + 1$. She may also decide to not do anything on some days because she is lazy. Bessie wants to maximize the number of haybales in pile $1$ (i.e. to maximize $a_1$), and she only has $d$ days to do so before Farmer John returns. Help her find the maximum number of haybales that may be in pile $1$ if she acts optimally! 
tl;dr: You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 

You are given a set of n pens, each of them can be red, blue, green, orange, and violet in color. Count a minimum number of pens that should be taken out from the set so that any two neighboring pens have different colors. Pens are considered to be neighboring if there are no other pens between them.

Lily is fascinated by numbers. She believes the whole world revolves around them, and that everything is connected by numbers. Her friends, Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diane, are not convinced. But she gives them an example:  Alice lives in house number 25 on her street, but that is exactly Bob s age. Bob is born on June 4th, and Charlie was his parents  fourth child. Finally, Diane has five fingers on her left hand, which happens to be the same as the number of toes that Bob has on his right foot!  This shows that her friends are all connected either directly or indirectly by numbers. But she still has to convince her family as well as her coworkers. Given a group of $n$ individuals, and a set of numbers that describe each individual, help Lily come up with a proof that shows that everyone in this group is either directly or indirectly connected by numbers, or determine that this is not possible.
