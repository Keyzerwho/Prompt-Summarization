Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word. Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3` etc. You need to return the highest scoring word as a string. If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string. All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid
tl;dr: Given a string of lowercase words, You need to return the highest scoring word as a string. If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string

Saket loves to play with strings. One day , while he was having fun with Cyclic Permutations of available strings to him, he observed that despite being scarce in numbers Vowels were really clingy.Being clingy means for almost every given string, there was a Cyclic Permutation in which atleast two vowels were together. So he decided to check this property for all the available strings to him. As the number of strings can be very large, help Saket determine whether the given string is clingy or not. 
tl;dr: Given a string return "Yes" if there are two vowels adjacent in it (first and last letter are adjacent), "No" otherwise. 

Master Oogway has forseen that a panda named Po will be the dragon warrior, and the master of Chi. But he did not tell anyone about the spell that would make him the master of Chi, and has left Po confused. Now Po has to defeat Kai, who is the super villian, the strongest of them all. Po needs to master Chi, and he finds a spell which unlocks his powerful Chi. But the spell is rather strange. It asks Po to calculate the factorial of a number! Po is very good at mathematics, and thinks that this is very easy. So he leaves the spell, thinking it's a hoax. But little does he know that this can give him the ultimate power of Chi. Help Po by solving the spell and proving that it's not a hoax. 
tl;dr: Find the factorial of each number from 1 to given positive integer n. 

Lily is fascinated by numbers. She believes the whole world revolves around them, and that everything is connected by numbers. Her friends, Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diane, are not convinced. But she gives them an example:  Alice lives in house number 25 on her street, but that is exactly Bob s age. Bob is born on June 4th, and Charlie was his parents  fourth child. Finally, Diane has five fingers on her left hand, which happens to be the same as the number of toes that Bob has on his right foot!  This shows that her friends are all connected either directly or indirectly by numbers. But she still has to convince her family as well as her coworkers. Given a group of $n$ individuals, and a set of numbers that describe each individual, help Lily come up with a proof that shows that everyone in this group is either directly or indirectly connected by numbers, or determine that this is not possible.
