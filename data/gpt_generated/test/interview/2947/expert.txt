 You are given a group of $n$ individuals and a set of numbers that describe each individual. Help Lily come up with a proof that shows that everyone in this group is either directly or indirectly connected by numbers, or determine that this is not possible. 
-----Input----- The input consists of:  - One line with an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$), the number of individuals in the group. The individuals are numbered from $1$ to $n$.  - $n$ lines, describing the individuals in the group. The $i$th such line starts with an integer $m_ i$ ($1 \leq m_ i \leq 2\cdot 10^5$), the number of numbers that describe individual $i$. The remainder of the line has $m_ i$ distinct integers $d_{i,1},\ldots ,d_{i,m_ i}$ ($1 \leq d_{i,j} \leq 10^9$ for each $j$), the set of numbers that describe individual $i$. It is guaranteed that the sum over all $m_ i$ is at most $2\cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- Output a proof in the form of $n-1$ lines, each of which contains three integers $p$, $q$ and $r$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct individuals that are both described by the number $r$. Using only these relations, it must be possible to show that any pair of individuals in the group are connected either directly or indirectly. If no such proof exists, output “impossible”. If there are multiple proofs, you may output any one of them. -----Examples----- Sample Input: 6 2 17 10 1 5 2 10 22 3 17 22 9 2 17 8 3 9 22 16 Sample Output: impossible
