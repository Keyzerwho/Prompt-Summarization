Mike and Joe take turns chugging beers. First Mike chugs one beer, then Joe chugs 2 beers, then Mike chugs 3 beers, then Joe chugs 4 beers, and so on. Once someone can't drink what he is supposed to drink, he loses. Write the function game(A,B) that returns the winner, "Mike" or "Joe" accordingly. A is the total beers Mike can chug, while B is the total beers Joe can chug. If either A or B is smaller than 1, return the string  "Non-drinkers can't play".
