There is only one thing for it, Chuck heads down to his local MMA gym and immediately challenges every fighter there to get in the cage and try and take him down... AT THE SAME TIME! 

You are provided an array of strings that represent the cage and Chuck's opponents. Your task is to take their heads off!! Throw punches, kicks, headbutts (or more likely - regex or iteration...) but whatever you do, remove their heads. Return the same array of strings, but with the heads ('O') removed and replaced with a space (' ').

If the provided array is empty, or is an empty string, return 'Gym is empty'. If you are given an array of numbers, return 'This isn't the gym!!'.
