Your work is to write a method that takes a value and an index, and returns the value with the bit at given index flipped. The bits are numbered from the least significant bit. The index number can be out of number's range. Example: Input: flip_bit(15, 4) Output: 7 Explanation: 15 in binary is 1111, after flipping 4th bit, it becomes 0111, i.e. 7 Input: flip_bit(15, 5) Output: 31 Explanation: 15 in binary is 1111, 5th bit is 0, after flipping, it becomes 11111, i.e., 31
