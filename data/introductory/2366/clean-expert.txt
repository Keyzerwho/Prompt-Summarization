you are given a list of of integers for every index print the index if there is a smaller value after that indexInput:The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10000$) — the number of sets of input data in the test. Input data sets must be processed independently, one after another.Each input data set consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 150000$) — the number of days. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$), where $a_i$ is the price on the $i$-th day.It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all data sets in the test does not exceed $150000$.Output:Print $t$ integers, the $j$-th of which should be equal to the number of indexes with a bad values in the $j$-th input data set.-----Example-----Input563 9 4 6 7 51100000022 11031 41 59 26 53 58 97 93 23 8473 2 1 2 3 4 5Output30182
