In this task, you have to define a function named func that will take a list as input. You must try and guess the pattern how we get the output number and return list - [output number,binary representation,octal representation,hexadecimal representation] Examples: Input: func([12,13,6,3,6,45,123]) Output: [29,'11101','35','1d'] Input: func([1,9,23,43,65,31,63,99]) Output: [41,'101001','51','29'] Input: func([2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,19]) Output: [10,'1010','12','a']
