Given 2 strings, if there is a substring that appears in both strings, return true. Otherwise, return false. We only count substrings that are > 1 in length. Lowercase and uppercase letters are the same. #Examples: Input: SubstringTest("Something","Fun"); Output: false Explanation: "Something" and "Fun" contain no common substrings. Input: SubstringTest("Something","Home"); Output: true Explanation: Both of the inputs contain the substring "me".
