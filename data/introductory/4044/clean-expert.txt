Write a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string with each of its suffixes. Examples: Input: string_suffix('ababaa') Output: 11 Explanation: The suffixes of the string are `ababaa`, `babaa`, `abaa`, `baa`, `aa` and `a`. The similarities of each of these strings with the string `ababaa` are 6,0,3,0,1,1 respectively. Thus the answer is 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11. Input: string_suffix('abc') Output: 3
