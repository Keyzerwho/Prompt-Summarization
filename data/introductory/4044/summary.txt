Given two strings A and B, the similarity of the strings is the length of the longest prefix common to both strings. For example, the similarity of strings `abc` and `abd` is 2, while the similarity of strings `aaa` and `aaab` is 3.

Write a function that calculates the sum of similarities of a string with each of its suffixes.

Examples:
Input:
string_suffix('ababaa')
Output:
11
Explanation:
The suffixes of the string are `ababaa`, `babaa`, `abaa`, `baa`, `aa` and `a`. The similarities of each of these strings with the string `ababaa` are 6,0,3,0,1,1 respectively. Thus the answer is 6 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 11.

Input:
string_suffix('abc')
Output:
3
