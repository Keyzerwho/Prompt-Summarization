You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros.
You perform $n$ actions with this array: during the $i$-th action:

Choose the leftmost maximum length subarray consisting only of zeros;
Let this segment be $[l; r]$. 
If $r-l+1$ is odd then assign $a[\frac{l+r}{2}] := i$ otherwise assign $a[\frac{l+r-1}{2}] := i$. 

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer — the array $a$ of length $n$ after performing $n$ actions described in the problem statement. Note that the answer exists and unique.
