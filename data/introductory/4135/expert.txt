Determine if the count of each of the characters in a string can be equal if a single character is removed from that string.

false
Explanation:
If we remove any character, the count of each character will not be equal.

Output:
true

If we remove one character, the remaining characters have same count.

Input:
solve('wwwf')
Output:
true
