Write a function named `first_non_repeating_letter` that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string. For example, if given the input `'stress'`, the function should return `'t'`, since the letter aggregate_results.csv check_split.py competition filter_generated.sh format.sh get_results.sh gpt.py interview introductory model_results.sh prompt.yaml prompt_generation.py results.sh solution.py split.txt studio21_api.py test.sh view_solution.sh only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string. As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the **same character**, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input `'sTreSS'` should return `'T'`. If a string contains *all repeating characters*, it should return an empty string (`""`) or `None` -- see sample tests.
