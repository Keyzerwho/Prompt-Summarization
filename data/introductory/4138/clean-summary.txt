Write a method that, given the correct word and the player's guess, returns this number. The guessed word should be the same length as the correct word. Examples: CountCorrectCharacters("dog", "car"); //0 (No letters are in the correct position) CountCorrectCharacters("dog", "god"); //1 ("o") CountCorrectCharacters("dog", "cog"); //2 ("o" and "g") CountCorrectCharacters("dog", "cod"); //1 ("o") CountCorrectCharacters("dog", "bog"); //2 ("o" and "g") CountCorrectCharacters("dog", "dog"); //3 (Correct!) count_correct_characters("dog", "car"); #0 (No letters are in the correct position) count_correct_characters("dog", "god"); #1 ("o") count_correct_characters("dog", "cog"); #2 ("o" and "g") count_correct_characters("dog", "cod"); #1 ("o") count_correct_characters("dog", "bog"); #2 ("o" and "g") count_correct_characters("dog", "dog"); #3 (Correct!)
