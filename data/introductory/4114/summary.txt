Given that you know the page you are on, how many products are in the category in total, and how many products are on any given page, output a simple string showing which products you are viewing.

Examples:

In a category of 30 products with 10 products per page, on page 1 you would see 

'Showing 1 to 10 of 30 Products.'

In a category of 26 products with 10 products per page, on page 3 you would see

'Showing 21 to 26 of 26 Products.'

In a category of 8 products with 10 products per page, on page 1 you would see

'Showing 1 to 8 of 8 Products.'
