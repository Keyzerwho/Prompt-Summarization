Given a one-digit number, you should find all unordered pairs of one-digit numbers whose values add up to the number.

Examples:
Input:
number = 'G'
Output:
["A + G", "B + F", "C + E", "D + D"]
Explanation:
Translating this into the decimal numeral system we get: number = 6, so it is ["0 + 6", "1 + 5", "2 + 4", "3 + 3"].

# Input/Output

 - `[input]` string(char in C#) `number`

   A character representing a correct one-digit number in the new numeral system.

   Constraints: `'A' ≤ number ≤ 'Z'.`

 - `[output]` a string array

   An array of strings in the format "letter1 + letter2", where "letter1" and "letter2" are correct one-digit numbers in the new numeral system. The strings should be sorted by "letter1".

   Note that "letter1 + letter2" and "letter2 + letter1" are equal pairs and we don't consider them to be different.
