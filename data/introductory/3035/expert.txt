For two matrices to be multipliable, the number of columns in matrix ```a``` must match the number of rows in matrix ```b```.

Write a function that takes two matrices - ```a``` and ```b``` - and returns the dot product of those matrices. If the matrices cannot be multiplied, return ```-1``` for JS/Python, or `null` for Java.

Each matrix will be represented by a two-dimensional list. Each inner list will contain one or more numbers, representing a row in the matrix.

For example, the following matrix:

```|1 2|``````|3 4|```

Would be represented as:

```[[1, 2], [3, 4]]```
