We make 2 rows and put first letter in the Row 1, the second in the Row 2, third in Row 1 and so on until the end. Then we put the text from Row 2 next to the Row 1 text.

Complete the function that receives a string and encrypt it with this simple transposition.

## Example
For example if the text to encrypt is: `"Simple text"`, the 2 rows will be:



Row 1
S
m
l
 
e
t


Row 2
i
p
e
t
x
 



So the result string will be: `"Sml etipetx"`
