Write a function that solves an algebraic expression given as a string and returns a string with the calculated value given in scientific notation with 5 decimal digits. The expression can include only sums and products. The numbers in the expression are in standard notation.

Examples:
Input:
strexpression = "5 * 4 + 6"
Output:
sum_prod(strexpression) = "2.60000e+01"
