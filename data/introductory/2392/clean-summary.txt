given a number $n$ and $m$. Find sum of last digits of all the numbers from $1$ to $n$ which are divisible by $m$Input:The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 1000$) — the number of queries.The following $q$ lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is given as two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 10^{16}$) — the number of pages in the book and required divisor, respectively.Output:For each query print the answer for it — the sum of digits.-----Example-----Input71 110 1100 31024 14998244353 1337123 1441234312817382646 13Output14515329433598350427262129093995
