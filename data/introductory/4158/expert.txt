Write a function that checks if all the letters in the second string are present in the first one at least once, regardless of how many times they appear. Function should not be case sensitive.

Examples:

["ab", "aaa"]    =>  true
["trances", "nectar"]    =>  true
["compadres", "DRAPES"]  =>  true
["parses", "parsecs"]    =>  false
