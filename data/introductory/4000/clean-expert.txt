You are given a positive number, find if it is strong or not. Example 1: Input: strong_num(1) Output: "STRONG!!!!" Explanation: Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1 is equal to number itself, then it's a Strong. Example 2: Input: strong_num(123) Output: "Not Strong !!" Explanation: Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to number itself, then it's Not Strong. Example 3: Input: strong_num(2) Output: "STRONG!!!!" Explanation: Since **_the sum of its digits' factorial of 2! = 2 is equal to number itself, then it's a Strong. Example 4: Input: strong_num(150) Output: "Not Strong !!" Explanation: Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to number itself, then it's Not Strong.
