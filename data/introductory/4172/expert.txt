Given a string, return the minimal number of parenthesis reversals needed to make balanced parenthesis.

For example:
Input:
solve(")(")
Output:
2
Explanation:
Because we need to reverse ")" to "(" and "(" to ")". These are 2 reversals.

Input: 
solve("(((())")
Output:
1
Explanation:
We need to reverse just one "(" parenthesis to make it balanced.

Input:
solve("(((")
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Not possible to form balanced parenthesis. Return -1.
