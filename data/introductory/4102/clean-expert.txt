Given a number, determine how many positive integers less than or equal to the number are odd but not prime. Assume it is an integer between 1 and 10000. Example: Input: 5 Output: 1 Explanation: 5 has three odd numbers (1,3,5) and only the number 1 is not prime, so the answer is 1 Input: 10 Output: 2 Explanation: Example: 10 has five odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9) and only 1 and 9 are not prime, so the answer is 2
