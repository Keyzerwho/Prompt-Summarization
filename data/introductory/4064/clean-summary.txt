Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first n multiples of x. Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0. Examples: Input: count_by(1,10) Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] Input: count_by(2,5) Output: [2,4,6,8,10]
