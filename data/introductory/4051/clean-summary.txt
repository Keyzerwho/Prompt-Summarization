Implement the ToUnderscore() method to translate a camelCase name into an underscore separated name. Make sure the results don't get split by underscores. So only add an underscore in front of the first number. Also if it's already an underscore name, don't change it. But if it's not split correctly, you should adjust them. Some of the names have a learning and trailing underscore, don't remove this. Examples: Input: "ThisIsAUnitTest" Output: "This_Is_A_Unit_Test" Input: "Calculate15Plus5Equals20" Output: "Calculate_15_Plus_5_Equals_20" Input: "This_Is_Already_Split_Correct" Output: "This_Is_Already_Split_Correct" Input: "ThisIs_Not_SplitCorrect" Output: "This_Is_Not_Split_Correct" Input: "_UnderscoreMarked_Test_Name_" Output: _Underscore_Marked_Test_Name_"
