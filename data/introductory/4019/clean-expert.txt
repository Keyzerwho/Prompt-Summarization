# Task Given two positive values: divisor and bound. Write a function maxMultiple(divisor, bound) to find the largest integer that is divisible by divisor and less than or equal to bound but greater than 0. It's guaranteed that a divisor is found. # Examples: Input: maxMultiple(2,7) Output: 6 Explanation: 6 is divisible 2, 6 is less than or equal to bound 7, and 6 is > 0. Input: maxMultiple(10,50) Output: 50 Explanation: 50is divisible by 10, 50 is less than or equal to bound 50, and 50 is > 0. Input: maxMultiple(37,200) Output: 185 Explanation: 185 is divisible by 37, 185 is less than or equal to bound 200, and 185 is > 0.
