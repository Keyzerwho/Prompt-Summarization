you are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order Example 1: Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3] Output: 3 Explanation: Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3] Target array : [1,1,1,2,3,4] On index 2 we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this element. On index 4 we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this element. On index 5 we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this element. Example 2: Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4] Output: 5 Example 3: Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5] Output: 0 Â  Constraints: 1 <= heights.length <= 100 1 <= heights[i] <= 100
