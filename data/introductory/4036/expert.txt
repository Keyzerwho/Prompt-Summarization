Write a function that receives a list of pairs and returns the number of days that the company is represented in the foreign country. The first number of the pair is the number of the day of arrival and the second number of the pair is the day of departure of someone who travels, i.e. 1 January is number 1 and 31 of December is 365.

Example:
Input:
days_represented([[10,17],[200,207]])
Output:
16
Explanation:
Returns 16 because there are two trips of 8 days, which add up to 16.
