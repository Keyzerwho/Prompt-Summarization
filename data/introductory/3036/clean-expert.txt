# Task Consider the following algorithm for constructing strings S(1) .. S(26): ``` S(1) = "a"; For i in [2, 3, ..., 26]: S(i) = S(i - 1) + character(i) + S(i - 1).``` Your task is to find the `k`th symbol (indexing from 1) in the string S(26). # Input / Output - `[input]` integer `k` 1 â‰¤ k < 2^(26) - `[output]` a string(char in C#) the `k`th symbol of S(26)
