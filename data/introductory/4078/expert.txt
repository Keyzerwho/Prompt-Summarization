Your task is to write a function that does just what the title suggests with an array/list/vector of integers and the expected number n of smallest elements to return.

Examples:
Input:
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],3)
Output:
[1,2,3]

Input:
first_n_smallest([5,4,3,2,1],3)
Output:
[3,2,1]

Input:
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,1],3)
Output:
[1,2,1]

Input:
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,-4,0],3)
Output:
[1,-4,0]

Input:
first_n_smallest([1,2,3,4,5],0)
Output:
[]
