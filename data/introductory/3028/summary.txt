The factorial of a number, `n!`, is defined for whole numbers as the product of all integers from `1` to `n`. 

For example, 5! is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

Write an implementation to calculate the factorial of arbitrarily large numbers, without recursion.

# Rules

* `n < 0` should return `nil`/  `None`
* `n = 0` should return `1`
* `n > 0` should return `n!`

# Note

Codewars limits the amount of data it will send back and forth, which may introduce a false ceiling for how high of a value of `n` it will accept. All tests use values less than this limit.
