The factorial of a number, `n!`, is defined for whole numbers as the product of all integers from `1` to `n`. 

Write an implementation to calculate the factorial of arbitrarily large numbers, without recursion.

# Rules

* `n < 0` should return `nil`/  `None`
* `n = 0` should return `1`
* `n > 0` should return `n!`
