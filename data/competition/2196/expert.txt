You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters. 

Calculate how many different strings T of length n can be composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of Longest Common Subsequence between S and T is n - 1.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two numbers n and m denoting the length of string S and number of first English lowercase characters forming the character set for strings (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 26).
