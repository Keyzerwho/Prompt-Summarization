You are given an array of integers. You can permute its integers. You want to do it so that as many as possible integers will become on a place where a smaller integer used to stand. Find the maximal number of such integers. Input: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) — the length of the array. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the elements of the array. Output: Print a single integer — the maximal number of the array's elements which after a permutation will stand on the position where a smaller element stood in the initial array. Examples: Input 7 10 1 1 1 5 5 3 Output 4 Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output 0
