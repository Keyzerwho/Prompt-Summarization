Given $t$ pairs of integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer $x_i$, such that: $p_i$ is divisible by $x_i$; $x_i$ is not divisible by $q_i$. Input: The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 50$) — the number of pairs. Each of the following $t$ lines contains two integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ ($1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}$; $2 \le q_i \le 10^{9}$) — the $i$-th pair of integers. Output: Print $t$ integers: the $i$-th integer is the largest $x_i$ such that $p_i$ is divisible by $x_i$, but $x_i$ is not divisible by $q_i$. One can show that there is always at least one value of $x_i$ satisfying the divisibility conditions for the given constraints. Example: Input 3 10 4 12 6 179 822 Output 10 4 179
