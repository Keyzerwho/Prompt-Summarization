Consider all integer sequences of length N whose elements are between 1 and 10, inclusive. Out of those 10^N sequences, how many contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku? Here, an integer sequence a_0, a_1, ..., a_{N-1} is said to contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku if and only if there exist four indices x, y, z, w (0 ≦ x < y < z < w ≦ N) such that all of the following are satisfied: - a_x + a_{x+1} + ... + a_{y-1} = X - a_y + a_{y+1} + ... + a_{z-1} = Y - a_z + a_{z+1} + ... + a_{w-1} = Z Print the answer modulo 10^9+7. -----Constraints----- - 3 ≦ N ≦ 40 - 1 ≦ X ≦ 5 - 1 ≦ Y ≦ 7 - 1 ≦ Z ≦ 5 Input: The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N X Y Z Output: Print the number of the sequences that contain an X,Y,Z-Haiku, modulo 10^9+7. -----Sample Input----- 3 5 7 5 -----Sample Output----- 1
