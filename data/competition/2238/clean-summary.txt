Let's denote $\text{popcount}(x)$ as the number of bits set in the binary representation of the non-negative integer x. You are given multiple queries consisting of pairs of integers l and r. For each query, find the x, such that l ≤ x ≤ r, and $\text{popcount}(x)$ is maximum possible. If there are multiple such numbers find the smallest of them. Input: The first line contains integer n — the number of queries (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000). Each of the following n lines contain two integers l_{i}, r_{i} — the arguments for the corresponding query (0 ≤ l_{i} ≤ r_{i} ≤ 10^18). Output: For each query print the answer in a separate line. Examples: Input 3 1 2 2 4 1 10 Output 1 3 7
