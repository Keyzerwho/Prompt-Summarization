You are given a line of n gemstones, the i-th of which has color c_{i}. The goal is to destroy all the gemstones in the line.

In one second, exactly one continuous substring of colored gemstones is chosen that is a palindrome and remove it from the line. After the substring is removed, the remaining gemstones shift to form a solid line again. 

What is the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line?


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) — the number of gemstones.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, the i-th of which is c_{i} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ n) — the color of the i-th gemstone in a line.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds needed to destroy the entire line.
