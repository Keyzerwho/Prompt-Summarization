You have two bags of distinct nonnegative integers. The bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is $\{0,1,â€¦,M-1\}$, for some positive integer $M$. You draw a number from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sum them modulo $M$. What are the residues modulo $M$ that you cannot obtain with this action? Input: The first line contains two positive integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 200\,000$) and $M$ ($N+1 \leq M \leq 10^{9}$), denoting the number of the elements in the first bag and the modulus, respectively. The second line contains $N$ nonnegative integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_N$ ($0 \leq a_1<a_2< \ldots< a_N<M$), the contents of the first bag. Output: In the first line, output the cardinality $K$ of the set of residues modulo $M$ which Ajs cannot obtain. In the second line of the output, print $K$ space-separated integers greater or equal than zero and less than $M$, which represent the residues Ajs cannot obtain. The outputs should be sorted in increasing order of magnitude. If $K$=0, do not output the second line. Examples: Input 2 5 3 4 Output 1 2 Input 4 1000000000 5 25 125 625 Output 0 Input 2 4 1 3 Output 2 0 2
