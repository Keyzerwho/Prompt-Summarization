There are n clicks in a game. For each click there are two outcomes: correct or bad. Let us denote correct as "O", bad as "X", then the whole play can be encoded as a sequence of n characters "O" and "X". Calculate the score for the play as follows: for every maximal consecutive "O"s block, add the square of its length to the score. If there are no correct clicks in a play then the score for the play equals to 0. You know that the probability to click the i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ n) click correctly is p_{i}. In other words, the i-th character in the play sequence has p_{i} probability to be "O", 1 - p_{i} to be "X". You task is to calculate the expected score for your play. Input: The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of clicks. The second line contains n space-separated real numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 1). There will be at most six digits after the decimal point in the given p_{i}. Output: Print a single real number — the expected score for your play. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. Examples: Input 3 0.5 0.5 0.5 Output 2.750000000000000 Input 4 0.7 0.2 0.1 0.9 Output 2.489200000000000 Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output 25.000000000000000
