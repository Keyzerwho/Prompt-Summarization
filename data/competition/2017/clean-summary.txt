You are given $2n$ number of different items which are in $n$ pairs. Line up the $2n$ number of items in such a way that each pair occupies adjacent positions in the line. Find the minimum number of swaps of adjacent positions which must be performed to make it so that each item pair occupies adjacent positions in the line. Input: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$), the number of pairs of different item. The second line contains $2n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{2n}$. For each $i$ with $1 \le i \le n$, $i$ appears exactly twice. If $a_j = a_k = i$, that means that the $j$-th and $k$-th itme in the line form a pair. Output: Output a single integer, representing the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to line the item up so that each pair occupies adjacent positions. Examples: Input 4 1 1 2 3 3 2 4 4 Output 2 Input 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 Output 0 Input 3 3 1 2 3 1 2 Output 3
