There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point (x_{i}, y_{i}).

Doctor Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|. Daniel, calculates the distance using the formula $\sqrt{(x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} +(y_{i} - y_{j})^{2}}$.

Compute the number of pairs (i, j), such that the distance between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between them calculated by Daniel.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of watchmen.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} (|x_{i}|, |y_{i}| ≤ 10^9).

Some positions may coincide.


-----Output-----

Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.
