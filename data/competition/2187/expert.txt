You have n apples numbered from 1 to n. You have to group them. Each group must contain two apples, and the greatest common divisor of numbers of the apples in each group must be greater than 1. Each apple can be part of at most one group.

Get the maximum possible number of groups.


-----Input-----

A single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the number of the apples.


-----Output-----

The first line must contain a single integer m, representing the maximum number of groups he can get. Each of the next m lines must contain two integers — the numbers of apples in the current group.

If there are several optimal answers you can print any of them.
