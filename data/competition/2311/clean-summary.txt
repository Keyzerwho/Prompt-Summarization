$f(n) = \text{product of non-zero digits of} n$ $g(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}{n} & {\text{if} n < 10} \\{g(f(n))} & {\text{otherwise}} \end{array} \right.$ You need to process Q queries. In each query, you will be given three integers l, r and k. You need to print the number of integers x between l and r inclusive, such that g(x) = k. Input: The first line of the input contains an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the number of queries. Q lines follow, each of which contains 3 integers l, r and k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9). Output: For each query, print a single line containing the answer for that query. Examples: Input 4 22 73 9 45 64 6 47 55 7 2 62 4 Output 1 4 0 8 Input 4 82 94 6 56 67 4 28 59 9 39 74 4 Output 3 1 1 5
