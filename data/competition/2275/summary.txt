Given a number $p$ and $n$ numbers $k_1, \ldots, k_n$, find p^{k_i}$ and divide that into two disjoint sets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in
each set. Find the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo $10^{9}+7$.

In the first test case of the example, there're the following numbers: $4$, $8$, $16$, $16$, and $8$. We can divide them into such two sets: ${4, 8, 16}$ and ${8, 16}$. 
Then the difference between the sums of numbers in sets would be $4$.

-----Input-----

Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 10^5)$ — the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \leq n, p \leq 10^6)$. The second line contains $n$ integers $k_i$ $(0 \leq k_i \leq 10^6)$.

The sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $10^6$.


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the reminder of division the answer by $1\,000\,000\,007$.
