You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $A$, $B$ and $C$. Find the number of different groups of three integers $a$, $b$, $c$ such that $1\leq a\leq b\leq c$ and parallelepiped $A\times B\times C$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $a\times b\times c$. Input: The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$) — the number of test cases. Each of the next $t$ lines contains three integers $A$, $B$ and $C$ ($1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10^5$) — the sizes of the parallelepiped. Output: For each test case, print the number of different groups of three points that satisfy all given conditions. Example: Input 4 1 1 1 1 6 1 2 2 2 100 100 100 Output 1 4 4 165
