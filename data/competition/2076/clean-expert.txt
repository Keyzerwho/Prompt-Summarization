You are given set of n points in 5-dimensional space. The points are labeled from 1 to n. No two points coincide. A point is bad if there are different points b and c, not equal to a, from the given set such that angle between vectors $\vec{ab}$ and $\vec{ac}$ is acute. Otherwise, the point is called good. Given the list of points, print the indices of the good points in ascending order. Input: The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) — the number of points. The next n lines of input contain five integers a_{i}, b_{i}, c_{i}, d_{i}, e_{i} (|a_{i}|, |b_{i}|, |c_{i}|, |d_{i}|, |e_{i}| ≤ 10^3)  — the coordinates of the i-th point. All points are distinct. Output: First, print a single integer k — the number of good points. Then, print k integers, each on their own line — the indices of the good points in ascending order.
