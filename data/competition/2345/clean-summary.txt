You are given n cards with numbers. The i-th card has the number a_{i} written on it. You have to put cards in a row to get one greater number. There are n! ways to put his cards in a row. The resulting big number is divisible by eleven. Find out how many ways are there to put the cards. Considers all cards different, even if some of them contain the same number. This number can be large, so output it modulo 998244353. Input: The first line of the input data contains an integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The descriptions of test cases follow. Each test is described by two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of cards. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — numbers written on the cards. It is guaranteed that the total number of cards in all tests of one input data doesn't exceed 2000. Output: For each test case output one line: the number of ways to put the cards to the table so that the resulting big number was divisible by 11, print the number modulo 998244353. Example: Input 4 2 1 1 3 1 31 12 3 12345 67 84 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Output 2 2 2 31680
