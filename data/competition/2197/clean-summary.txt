You are given a string A. Find a string B, where B is a palindrome and A is a subsequence of B. The length of string B should be at most 10^4. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4. Input: First line contains a string A (1 ≤ |A| ≤ 10^3) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where |A| is a length of A. Output: Output single line containing B consisting of only lowercase Latin letters. You do not need to find the shortest answer, the only restriction is that the length of string B should not exceed 10^4. If there are many possible B, print any of them. Examples: Input aba Output aba Input ab Output aabaa
