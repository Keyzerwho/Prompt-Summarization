You are given an undirected graph with n vertexes. Each its edge has unit length. Calculate the number of shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

You should output a graph G with n vertexes (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000). There must be exactly k shortest paths between vertex 1 and vertex 2 of the graph.

The first line must contain an integer n. Then adjacency matrix G with n rows and n columns must follow. Each element of the matrix must be 'N' or 'Y'. If G_{ij} is 'Y', then graph G has a edge connecting vertex i and vertex j. Consider the graph vertexes are numbered from 1 to n.

The graph must be undirected and simple: G_{ii} = 'N' and G_{ij} = G_{ji} must hold. And there must be at least one path between vertex 1 and vertex 2. It's guaranteed that the answer exists. If there multiple correct answers, you can output any of them.
