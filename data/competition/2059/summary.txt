You are given a sequence. An inversion in sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a pair of indexes i, j (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n), such that an inequality a_{i} > a_{j} holds.

You can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. You want the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Find the minimum number of inversions you can get.


-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (|p_{i}| ≤ 10^5). The numbers are separated by spaces.


-----Output-----

In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions you can get.
