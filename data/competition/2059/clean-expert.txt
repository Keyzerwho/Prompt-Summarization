You are given a sequence. You can multiply some numbers of the sequence p by -1. You want the number of inversions in the sequence to be minimum. Find the minimum number of inversions you can get. Input: The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000). The next line contains n integers — sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (|p_{i}| ≤ 10^5). The numbers are separated by spaces. Output: In a single line print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of inversions you can get. Examples: Input 2 2 1 Output 0 Input 9 -2 0 -1 0 -1 2 1 0 -1 Output 6
