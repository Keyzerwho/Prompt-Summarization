You are at the origin. You will make $n$ moves. There are $n$ vectors $\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, \cdots, \vec{v_n}$. During the $i$-th move you will either move in the direction $\vec{v_i}$ or $-\vec{v_i}$. Figure out a sequence of moves such that your final position $p$ satisfies $|p| \le 1.5 \cdot 10^6$. Input: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of moves. Each of the following lines contains two space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$, meaning that $\vec{v_i} = (x_i, y_i)$. We have that $|v_i| \le 10^6$ for all $i$. Output: Output a single line containing $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \cdots, c_n$, each of which is either $1$ or $-1$. Your solution is correct if the value of $p = \sum_{i = 1}^n c_i \vec{v_i}$, satisfies $|p| \le 1.5 \cdot 10^6$. It can be shown that a solution always exists under the given constraints.
