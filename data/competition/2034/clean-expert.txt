You are given $n$ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $n$ points is strictly convex, and there are no three collinear points. The points are numbered from $1$ to $n$, in clockwise order. Find the maximum possible perimeter for each possible number of points (i.e. $3$ to $n$). Input: The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^5$) — the number of points. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^8 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^8$) — the coordinates of point $p_i$. The set of points is guaranteed to be convex, all points are distinct, the points are ordered in clockwise order, and there will be no three collinear points. Output: For each $i$ ($3\leq i\leq n$), output $f(i)$. Examples: Input 4 2 4 4 3 3 0 1 3 Output 12 14 Input 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 Output 8
