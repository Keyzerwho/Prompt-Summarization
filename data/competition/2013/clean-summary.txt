You are given a non-empty string s consisting of lowercase English letters. You have to pick exactly one non-empty substring of s and shift all its letters 'z' $\rightarrow$ 'y' $\rightarrow$ 'x' $\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow$ 'b' $\rightarrow$ 'a' $\rightarrow$ 'z'. What is the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by performing this shift exactly once? Input: The only line of the input contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 000) consisting of lowercase English letters. Output: Print the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s by shifting letters of exactly one non-empty substring. Examples: Input codeforces Output bncdenqbdr Input abacaba Output aaacaba
