Given a number n, find the number x and the numbers whose arithmentic sum of their digits with themselves will give the number n itself. Input: The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). Output: In the first line print one integer k — number of different values of x satisfying the condition. In next k lines print these values in ascending order. Examples: Input 21 Output 1 15 Input 20 Output 0
