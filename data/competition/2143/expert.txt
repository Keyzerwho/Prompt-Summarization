You are given n fountains with its beauty and cost are known.There are two types of money: coins and diamonds, so each fountain cost can be either in coins or diamonds. No money changes between the types are allowed.

Build two fountains with maximum total beauty so that both can be bought at the same time.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, c and d (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 0 ≤ c, d ≤ 100 000) — the number of fountains, the number of coins and diamonds.

The next n lines describe fountains. Each of these lines contain two integers b_{i} and p_{i} (1 ≤ b_{i}, p_{i} ≤ 100 000) — the beauty and the cost of the i-th fountain, and then a letter "C" or "D", describing in which type of money is the cost of fountain i: in coins or in diamonds, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total beauty of exactly two fountains that can build. If two fountains can't be built, print 0.
