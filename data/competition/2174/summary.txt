You have a sequence, consisting of n non-negative integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}.

Let's define function f(l, r) where l, r are integer, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n for sequence a as an operation of bitwise OR of all the sequence elements with indexes from l to r.

Count the number of distinct values of function f(l, r) for the given sequence a.

-----Input-----

The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements of sequence a. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^6) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the number of distinct values of function f(l, r) for the given sequence a.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.
