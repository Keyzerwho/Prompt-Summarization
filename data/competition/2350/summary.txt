Given an integer N, find the number of 3-uniform hypertrees on N vertices. Two 3-uniform hypertrees are considered different if a hyperedge (u, v, w) exists such that it is present in exactly one of these hypertrees.
-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T -- the number of test cases (at most 15). Then T lines follow, each contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 17).

Important! Please include all code used in solving this problem in your solution.

-----Output-----
For each test case output one line containing the requested number. It's guaranteed that this number won't exceed 263-1.

-----Examples-----
Input:
4

5
8

Output:
1
