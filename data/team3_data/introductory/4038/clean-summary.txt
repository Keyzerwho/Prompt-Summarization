# Task Given a position of a knight on the standard chessboard, find the number of different moves the knight can perform. The knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from it. The complete move therefore looks like the letter L. # Example For `cell = "a1"`, the output should be `2`. For `cell = "c2"`, the output should be `6`. # Input/Output - `[input]` string `cell` String consisting of letter+number - coordinates of the knight on an 8 Ã— 8 chessboard in chess notation. - `[output]` an integer
