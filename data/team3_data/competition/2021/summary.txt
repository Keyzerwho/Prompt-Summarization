The graph G is given. Subset A of its vertices is called a vertex cover of this graph, if for each edge uv there is at least one endpoint of it in this set, i.e. $u \in A$ or $v \in A$ or both.

Find two disjoint subsets of its vertices A and B, such that both A and B are vertex cover or claim it's impossible.

-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph, respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains a pair of integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1  ≤  u_{i},  v_{i}  ≤  n), denoting an undirected edge between u_{i} and v_{i}. It's guaranteed the graph won't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.


-----Output-----

If it's impossible to split the graph into two disjoint subsets, print "-1" (without quotes).

If there are two disjoint sets of vertices, such that both sets are vertex cover, print their descriptions. Each description must contain two lines. The first line contains a single integer k denoting the number of vertices in that vertex cover, and the second line contains k integers — the indices of vertices. Note that because of m ≥ 1, vertex cover cannot be empty.
