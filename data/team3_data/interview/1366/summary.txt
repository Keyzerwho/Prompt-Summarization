You are given N values with weight attached to each value. 
You need to find minimum number of continuous values to be chosen such that total weight of these values is maximum possible.
You need to chose atleast one value.

-----Input:-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A_1, A_2,....., A_N.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= T <= 10
- 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5
- 0 <= A_i <= 10^9
