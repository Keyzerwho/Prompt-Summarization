You are given an array of numbers. Make sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order Return the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets   Example 1: Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1] Output: 3 Explanation: We can form three sets given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). Example 2: Input: rating = [2,1,3] Output: 0 Explanation: We can't form any set given the conditions. Example 3: Input: rating = [1,2,3,4] Output: 4   Constraints: n == rating.length 1 <= n <= 200 1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5
