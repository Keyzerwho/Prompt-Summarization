You have to distribute $N$ candies among kids who are sitting in a circle. Distribute candies in such a way that there is a difference of at least $K$ candies between two adjacent kids. Find the minimum number of candies that satisfy the above conditions, such that, each kid gets at least one candy. -----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. - The only line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. -----Output:----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of candies you need. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^6$ - $2 \leq N \leq 10^3$ - $0 \leq K \leq 10^4$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 2 1 -----Sample Output:----- 3
