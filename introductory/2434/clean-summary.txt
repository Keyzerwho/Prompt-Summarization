We have two patterns in characters. The first one can be represented by one bit 0. The second one can be represented by two bits either 10 or 11. You are given an array with several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. the given array will always ends with a zero Example 1: Input: bits = [1, 0, 0] Output: True Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character. Example 2: Input: bits = [1, 1, 1, 0] Output: False Explanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character. Note: 1 . bits[i] is always 0 or 1.
