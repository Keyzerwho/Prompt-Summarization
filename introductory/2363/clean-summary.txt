You are given a list of integers of length $n$. You need to split the list into two smaller lists.Each list must have at least one integer, and every integer must be in exactly one list.You want to largest integer from the first list to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list.The output will be the smallest value of this difference.For example, if $n=5$ and the list is $s=3, 1, 2, 6, 4$, then one of the possible splits is:   $A = 1, 2, 4$, $B = 3, 6$. The value $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$ is equal to $|4-3|=1$. Input:The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow.Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains positive integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 50$) — length of the list. The second line contains $n$ positive integers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ ($1 \le s_i \le 1000$), where $s_i$ — is the integer of the $i$-th element.Output:For each test case print one integer — the minimum value of $|\max(A) - \min(B)|$-----Example-----Input553 1 2 6 462 1 3 2 4 347 9 3 121 10003100 150 200Output10299950
