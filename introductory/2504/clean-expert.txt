You are given an array arr.Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays.Example 1:Input: arr = 1,4,2,5,3Output: 58Explanation: The odd-length subarrays of arr and their sums are:1 = 14 = 42 = 25 = 53 = 31,4,2 = 74,2,5 = 112,5,3 = 101,4,2,5,3 = 15If we add all these together we get 1 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 10 + 15 = 58Example 2:Input: arr = 1,2Output: 3Explanation: There are only 2 subarrays of odd length, 1 and 2. Their sum is 3.Example 3:Input: arr = 10,11,12Output: 66Â Constraints:1 <= arr.length <= 1001 <= arri <= 1000
