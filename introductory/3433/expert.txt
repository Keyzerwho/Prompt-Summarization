Given an array containing only zeros and ones, find the index of the zero that, if converted to one, 
will make the longest sequence of ones.

For instance, given the array:
```
[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
```
replacing the zero at index 10 forms a sequence of 9 ones:

If there are multiple valid answers, return the last one
