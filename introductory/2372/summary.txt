You are given an array $a$ consisting of one element $1$ ($a = [1]$).

In one move, you can do one of the following things:

  Increase some (single) element of $a$ by $1$ (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and increase $a_i$ by one);  Append the copy of some (single) element of $a$ to the end of the array (choose some $i$ from $1$ to the current length of $a$ and append $a_i$ to the end of the array). 

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$) — the lower bound on the sum of the array.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least $n$.
