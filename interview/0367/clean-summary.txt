You are given a read only array containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assuming only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.Assuming the array is read only, use only constant extra space and runtime complexity should be less than O(n2)Example 1:Input: 1,3,4,2,2Output: 2Example 2:Input: 3,1,3,4,2Output: 3
