You are given a read only array of n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive).
For each value in the array check whether there is another duplicate value in the array.
If so, return that value without modifying the actual array.

Example 1:


Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
