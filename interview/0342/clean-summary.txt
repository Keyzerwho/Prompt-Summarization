Given an 2 dimentional array count number of structures in it.Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s.You may assume the following rules:You receive a valid 2 dimentional array, made of only structures or emptyslots.  Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two structures.Example:X..X...X...XIn the above 2 dimentional array there are 2 structures.Invalid Example:...XXXXX...XThis is an invalid 2 dimentional array that you will not receive - as structureswill always have a cell separating between them.
