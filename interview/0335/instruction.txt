You are given an array of integers. You need to add these integers without repetition and generate two largest possible numbers of equal value. For example, if you have numbers 1, 2, and 3, you can add them together to make a sum of value 6.
Return the largest possible sum.  If you cannot make two sums of equal value, return 0.
 
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.


Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.



Example 3:
Input: [1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: tow equal interers cannot be generated, so we return 0.


 
Note:

0 <= rods.length <= 20
1 <= rods[i] <= 1000
The sum of rods is at most 5000.
