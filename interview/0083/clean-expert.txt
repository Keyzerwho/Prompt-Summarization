You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$.For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second, both A and B will be at position $4$.Will the two entities be at the same position at the same moment? If so, how long will it take? Let's find a moment in time (in seconds) after which the entities will be at the same point.Input:Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$).Each test case contains exactly one line. The line consists of four integers $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$ ($0 \le x \lt y \le 10^9$, $1 \le a,b \le 10^9$) â€” the current position of the entity A , the current position of the entity b, the moving distance of the entity A, and the moving distance of the entity b, respectively.Output:For each test case, print the single integer: number of seconds the two entities will take to be at the same position.If the two entities will never be at the same position simultaneously, print $-1$.-----Example-----Input50 10 2 30 10 3 3900000000 1000000000 1 99999991 2 1 11 3 1 1Output2-110-11Note:The first case is explained in the description.In the second case, each rabbit will be at position $3$ and $7$ respectively at the $1$-st second. But in the $2$-nd second they will be at $6$ and $4$ respectively, and we can see that they will never be at the same position since the distance between the two rabbits will only increase afterward.
