A entity can have some specialization: A or B. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time.You need to form a team. So the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one A, at least one B and it consists of exactly three entities.You know that $c$ of the students are specialised in A, $m$ are in B and $x$ have no specialization.What is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into? Note that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team.You are also asked to answer $q$ independent queries.Input:The first line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^4$) — the number of queries. Each of the next $q$ lines contains three integers $c$, $m$ and $x$ ($0 \le c, m, x \le 10^8$) — the number of coders, mathematicians and students without any specialization in the university, respectively.Note that the no student is both specialized in A and B at the same time. Output:Print $q$ integers — the $i$-th of them should be the answer to the $i$ query in the order they are given in the input. The answer is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute your students into. -----Example-----Input61 1 13 6 00 0 00 1 110 1 104 4 1Output130013Note:In the first example here are how teams are formed:  the only team of 1 A, 1 B and 1 without specialization;  all three teams consist of 1 A and 2 B;  no teams can be formed;  no teams can be formed;  one team consists of 1 A, 1 B and 1 without specialization, the rest aren't able to form any team;  one team consists of 1 A, 1 B and 1 without specialization, one consists of 2 A and 1 B and one consists of 1 A and 2 B.
