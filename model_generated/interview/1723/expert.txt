 ## Bezier curves When a shape is described using vector graphics, its outline is often described as a sequence of linear, quadratic, and cubic Bezier curves. You don't need to know much about Bezier curves to solve this kata. Just know that the equations of the linear, quadratic, and cubic curves are given by (respectively): 1. `P(t) = (1 - t) * P0 + t * P1` 2. `P(t) = (1 - t)**2 * P0
