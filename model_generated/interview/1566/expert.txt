 You are given partially filled matrix B of dimension N. You need to find whether it is possible to fill the remaining entries of matrix B such that the resulting matrix B is good.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, Q. Each of the next Q lines contain three space separated integers i, j, val, which means that B[i][j] is filled with value val. -----Output----- For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) in a single line corresponding to the answer of the problem. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 106 - 2 ≤ N ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ Q ≤ 106 - 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N - 0 ≤ val ≤ 1 - Sum of each of N, Q over all test cases doesn't exceed 106 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1 (40 points) 2 ≤ N ≤ 103, 1 ≤ Q ≤ 103, Sum of each of N, Q over all test cases doesn't exceed 104 - Subtask #2 (60 points) Original Constraints -----Example----- Input 4 2 2 1 1 0 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 3 2 2 2 0 2 3 1 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 3 1 Output yes no yes no -----Explanation----- Example 1. You can fill the entries of matrix B as follows.  0 1 1 0 This matrix corresponds to the array A = [1, 2]. Example 2. It is impossible to fill the remaining entries of matrix B such that the resulting matrix is good, as B[1][2] = 1 and B[2][1] = 0, which is impossible.
