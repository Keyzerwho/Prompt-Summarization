 You are given two integers $N$ and $M$. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to $N \times M$ in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with $N$ rows and $M$ columns in which all numbers from 1 to $N \times M$ appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
-----Input:----- The first line contains 3 integers, $N$, $M$ and $K$ ($1 \le N, M, K \le 10^5$). The next $K$ lines describe deliveries. Each line contains 4 space-separated integers $x_i$, $y_i$, $x'_i$, $y'_i$ ($1 \le x_i, x'_i \le N$, $1 \le y_i, y'_i \le M$), describing the $i$-th delivery. -----Output:----- Print one integer -- the minimum sum of durations possible. -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1 [17 points]: $y_i = y_{i-1}$ for all $i>0$.  - Subtask 2 [34 points]: $K \le 10$. - Subtask 3 [49 points]: No additional constraints. -----Sample Input 1:----- 5 4 3 2 3 4 1 1 4 5 2 3 3 5 3 -----Sample Output 1:----- 16 -----Explanation:----- Salmon can turn the 3rd horizontal road into a highway. - For the first delivery, we can go 2 units to the right taking 2 units of time, and 2 units down taking 4 units of time. The time taken is $2 + 4 = 6$. - For the second delivery, we can go 1 unit down taking 2 units of time, 4 units right taking 4 units of time, and 1 unit down taking 2 units of time. The time taken is $2 + 4 + 2 = 8$. - For the third delivery, we can go 2 units right taking 2 units of time. Therefore, the total time taken is $6 + 8 + 2 = 16$. -----Sample Input 2:----- 10 2 3 1 2 10 2 2 1 9 1 4 1 7 1 -----Sample Output 2:----- 23 -----Explanation:----- Salmon can turn the 1st horizontal road into a highway. - For the first delivery, we can go 1 unit down taking 2 units of time, 9 units right taking 9 units of time, and 1 unit up taking 2 units of time. The time taken is $2 + 9 + 2 = 13$. - For the second delivery, we can go 7 units right taking 7 units of time. - For the third delivery, we can go 3 units to the right taking 3 units of time. Therefore, the total time taken is $13 + 7 + 3 = 23$.
