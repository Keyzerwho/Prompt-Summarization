 You are given $m, n, a, d \in \mathbb{N}$ where $n < m$, find the number of $x \in \{n, n+1, ..., m-1, m\}$ such that $x$ is not divisible by $a$, $a+d$, $a+2d$, $a+3d$ or $a+4d$ 
-----Input----- The first line is the number $t$, corresponding to number of test cases\ This is followed by $t$ lines of the format: $n$ $m$ $a$ $d$ -----Output----- For each test case, print a single number that is the number of gifts Santa should pack. -----Constraints----- - $1 < m, n, a \leq 2^{32}$ - $1 < d \leq 2^{10}$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 2 20 2 1 -----Sample Output:----- 5 -----Explanation:----- In the range {2, 3, 4, â€¦, 19, 20}, only {7, 11, 13, 17, 19} are not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
