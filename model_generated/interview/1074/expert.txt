 You are given 2 integer arrays of length $n$, array $x$ and array $y$. For each array, you want to make all its values equivalent such that $x_1$ = $x_2$ = $x_3$ = ... = $x_n$ and $y_1$ = $y_2$ = $y_3$ = ... = $y_n$ in the least number of moves possible. In one move, you can decrement the value of an element by 1 at $x_i$ or $y_i$, or
Input: The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows :. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n the number of wooden logs.  The second line contains  n space-separated integers l1,l2,l3….ln The length of each wooden log Output:  The only line in Output Contains single Integer denoting the maximum possible number of Wooden Frames. Constraints: 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 1 ≤ li ≤ 10000 Example Input: 2 4 1 2 1 2 8 1 2 1 3 4 1 5 6 Example Output: 1 0 Explanation : First Case :  We can build a frame of dimension 1x2 as two logs of each dimension are available. Second Case :  We can’t build any Frame as no logs of length except 1 have more than one piece.
