 Given a word $s$ of length $n$ consisting of only lowercase Latin letters and an integer $k$, such that $n$ is divisible by $k$. Bob wants to convert $s$ to any $k$-complete word. To do this Bob can choose some $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) and replace the letter at position $i$ with some other lowercase Latin letter. So now Bob wants to know the minimum number of letters he has to replace to convert $s$ to any $k$-complete word. Note that Bob can do zero changes if the word $
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t\le 10^5$) â€” the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k < n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $n$ is divisible by $k$). The second line of each test case contains a word $s$ of length $n$. It is guaranteed that word $s$ only contains lowercase Latin letters. And it is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases will not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, output one integer, representing the minimum number of characters he has to replace to convert $s$ to any $k$-complete word. -----Example----- Input 4 6 2 abaaba 6 3 abaaba 36 9 hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia 21 7 wudixiaoxingxingheclp Output 2 0 23 16 -----Note----- In the first test case, one optimal solution is aaaaaa. In the second test case, the given word itself is $k$-complete.
