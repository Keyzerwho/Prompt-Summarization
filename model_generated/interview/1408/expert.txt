  
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line contains string a. The second line contains string b. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing answer of the problem. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ |a| = |b| ≤ 105 - '1' ≤ ai, bi ≤ '2' -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1 (30 points) |a|, |b| ≤  10 - Subtask #2 (70 points) original constraints -----Example----- Input: 2 1111 2211 222 111 Output: 8 0 -----Explanation----- Test case 1. Possible subsets are:  {}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {3}, {4}, {3, 4}. Test case 2. There are no possible sets S which can make both the strings good.
