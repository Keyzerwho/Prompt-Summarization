 You are given two arrays $A$ and $B$ of length $n$ and $m$ respectively. You need to find the number of different interleavings $X$ of $A$ and $B$ that produce an output array $C$ with exactly $K$ blocks.  Note that we are counting the number of interleavings, not the number of different output arrays after interleaving.  For instance, if the same output array C is produced via 2 different interleavings, it gets counted twice. Since the answer might be large, print the answer modulo
-----Input Format:----- - The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows. - The first line of each testcase contains three integers: $n$, $m$, and $K$, which denote the size of array $A$, the size of array $B$, and the required number of blocks in $C$, respectively. - The next line contains $n$ integers, which represent the array $A$. - The next line contains $m$ integers, which represent the array $B$. -----Output Format:----- - You should print the answer in a new line for each testcase, which should be the number of valid interleaving arrays $X$ which correspond to an output array $C$ with $K$ blocks, modulo $10^8 + 7$. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq n \leq 100$ - $1 \leq m \leq 100$ - $1 \leq K \leq n+m$ - $0 \leq A_i, B_j \leq 10^9$ -----Subtasks:----- - Subtask 1: 10% points: $m = 1$ - Subtask 2: 30% points: $0 \leq A_i, B_j \leq 1$ - Subtask 3: 60% points: Original constraints. -----Sample Input:----- 5 2 2 4 1 3 3 4 2 2 3 1 3 3 4 2 2 2 1 3 3 4 2 2 4 4 7 8 5 2 2 2 4 7 8 5 -----Sample Output:----- 4 2 0 6 0 -----Explanation:----- - The first three testcases correspond to the example given in the problem statement. Of the $6$ interleavings, $4$ produce outputs with $4$ blocks and $2$ produce outputs with $3$ blocks.  Hence, for $K = 4$, the answer is $4$, for $K = 3$, the answer is $2$, and for $K = 2$, the answer is $0$. - The fourth and fifth testcases have $A = [4, 7]$ and $B = [8, 5]$.  Here are the $6$ interleavings of these two arrays. - $X = [0, 0, 1, 1]$, which corresponds to $C= [4, 7, 8, 5]$, $4$ blocks. - $X = [0, 1, 0, 1]$, which corresponds to $C= [4, 8, 7, 5]$, $4$ blocks. - $X = [0, 1, 1, 0]$, which corresponds to $C= [4, 8, 5, 7]$, $4$ blocks. - $X = [1, 0, 0, 1]$, which corresponds to $C= [8, 4, 7, 5]$, $4$ blocks. - $X = [1, 0, 1, 0]$, which corresponds to $C= [8, 4, 5, 7]$, $4$ blocks. - $X = [1, 1, 0, 0]$, which corresponds to $C= [8, 5, 4, 7]$, $4$ blocks. All $6$ interleavings produce outputs with $4$ blocks, so for $K = 4$ the answer is $6$ and for any other value of $K$, the answer is $0$.
