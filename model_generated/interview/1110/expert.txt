 You are given an array. You are asked to find minimum number of modifications that must be performed so that the resulting array can be partitioned into permutations. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer N$N$. - The second line contains N$N$ space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN$A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum required number of modifications. -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤1,000$1 \le T \le 1,000$ - 1≤N≤106$1 \le N \le 10^6$ - 1≤Ai≤109$1 \le A_i \le 10^9$ for each valid i$i$ - the sum of N$N$ over all test cases does not exceed 106$10^6$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (50 points): - 1≤N≤1,000$1 \le N \le 1,000$ - the sum of N$N$ over all test cases does not exceed 10,000$10,000$ Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 5 1 4 1 2 2 4 2 3 2 3 -----Example Output----- 1 2
