 You are given a list. Each element represent a string. Return the number of double strings in the list. e.g. "abab" is a double string as it can be represented as "ab" + "ab" where + operation denotes concatenation.  Similarly, "aa", "abcabc" are double strings whereas "a", "abba", "abc" are not. 
-----Input----- - First line of the input contains an integer D denoting the number of dishes prepared by Chef on that day. - Each of the next D lines will contain description of a dish.  	 - The i-th line contains the name of i-th dish Si. 	 -----Output----- For each of the D dishes, print a single line containing "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) denoting whether the dish can be called as a special or not. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ D ≤ 106 - 1 ≤ |Si| ≤ 106. - Each character of string Si will be lower case English alphabet (i.e. from 'a' to 'z'). -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 : (20 points) - Sum of |Si| in an input file doesn't exceed 2 * 103 Subtask 2 : (80 points)  - Sum of |Si| in an input file doesn't exceed 2 * 106 -----Example----- Input: 3 aba abac abcd Output: YES NO NO -----Explanation----- Example case 1. We can remove the character at position 1 (0-based index) to get "aa" which is a double string. Hence, it is a special dish. Example case 2. It is not possible to remove the character at any of the position to get the double string. Hence, it is not a special dish.
