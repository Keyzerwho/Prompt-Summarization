 You are given Polycarp's spell set and a sequence of $n$ changes. For each change calculate the maximum possible damage Polycarp may deal using the spells he knows. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of changes to the spell set. Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $tp$ and $d$ ($0 \le tp_i \le 1$; $-10^9 \le d \le 10^9$; $d_i \neq 0$) — the description of the change. If $tp_i$ if equal to $0$, then Polycarp learns (or forgets) a fire spell, otherwise he learns (or forgets) a lightning spell. If $d_i > 0$, then Polycarp learns a spell of power $d_i$. Otherwise, Polycarp forgets a spell with power $-d_i$, and it is guaranteed that he knew that spell before the change. It is guaranteed that the powers of all spells Polycarp knows after each change are different (Polycarp never knows two spells with the same power). -----Output----- After each change, print the maximum damage Polycarp can deal with his current set of spells. -----Example----- Input 6 1 5 0 10 1 -5 0 5 1 11 0 -10 Output 5 25 10 15 36 21
