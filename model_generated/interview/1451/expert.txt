 You are given a graph. You need to find the shortest path between two vertices.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N$N$ and M$M$. - M$M$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1≤i≤M$1 \le i \le M$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ui$u_i$ and vi$v_i$ denoting an edge between vertices ui$u_i$ and vi$v_i$. -----Output----- For each test case: - If a valid way to direct the edges does not exist, print a single line containing one integer −1$-1$. - Otherwise, print a single line containing M$M$ space-separated integers. For each valid i$i$, the i$i$-th of these integers should be 0$0$ if edge i$i$ is directed from ui$u_i$ to vi$v_i$ or 1$1$ if it is directed from vi$v_i$ to ui$u_i$. -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤5$1 \le T \le 5$ - 1≤N,M≤105$1 \le N, M \le 10^5$ - 1≤ui,vi≤N$1 \le u_i, v_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$ - the graph on the input is connected, does not contain multiple edges or self-loops -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): 1≤N,M≤1,000$1 \le N, M \le 1,000$ Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 4 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 3 4 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 -----Example Output----- 0 0 1 1 -1
