 You are given a $N \times N$ grid with $N$ cells containing pepperonis. Chef wants to cut the pizza vertically in half and give the two halves to two of his friends. Formally, one friend should get everything in the columns $1$ through $N/2$ and the other friend should get everything in the columns $N/2+1$ through $N$. Before doing that, if Chef wants to, he may choose one row of the grid and reverse it, i.e. swap the contents of the cells in the $i$-th and $N+1-i$-th column in this row for each $i$
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - $N$ lines follow. For each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N$), the $i$-th of these lines contains a string with length $N$ describing the $i$-th row of the grid; this string contains only characters '1' (denoting a cell with pepperonis) and '0' (denoting a cell without pepperonis). -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum absolute difference between the number of cells with pepperonis in the half-pizzas given to Chef's friends. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 1,000$ - $2 \le N \le 1,000$ - $N$ is even - the sum of $N \cdot N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^6$ -----Example Input----- 2 6 100000 100000 100000 100000 010010 001100 4 0011 1100 1110 0001 -----Example Output----- 2 0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Initially, $|p_1-p_2| = 4$, but if Chef reverses any one of the first four rows from "100000" to "000001", $|p_1-p_2|$ becomes $2$. Example case 2: Initially, $|p_1-p_2| = 0$. We cannot make that smaller by reversing any row.
