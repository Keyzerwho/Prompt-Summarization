 You are given a string s of length n consisting of digits 4 and 7. The string s is called balanced if there exits such integer x (1   x   n) that the number of digits 4 in substring s[1; x) is equal to the number of digits 7 in substring s(x; n], where s[1; x) is the substring from the 1st digit to (x-1)th digit of s, and s(x
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer T, the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each of which contains string s for the corresponding test. -----Output----- T lines, each of which contains single integer - the answer for the corresponding test modulo 109+7. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 -----Example----- Input: 2 47 4477 Output: 1 4
