 You are given a list of books. You need to build n shelves. Each shelf has n books. Each book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1]. You need to build n shelves. Each shelf has n books. Each book has thickness books[i][0] and height books[i][1]. Return the minimum possible height of the bookshelf. 
Example 1: Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4 Output: 6 Explanation: The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf. Â  Constraints: 1 <= books.length <= 1000 1 <= books[i][0] <= shelf_width <= 1000 1 <= books[i][1] <= 1000
