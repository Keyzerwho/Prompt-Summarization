 Given a binary tree with the following rules: root.val == 0 If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.left != null, then treeNode.left.val == 2 * x + 1 If treeNode.val == x and treeNode.right != null, then treeNode.right.val == 2 * x + 2 Now the binary tree is contamined, which means all treeNode.val have been changed to -1. You need to first recover the binary tree and then
