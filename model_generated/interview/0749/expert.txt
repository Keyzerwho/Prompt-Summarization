 The government of Siruseri wants to implement a nation-wide fiber-optic network. The government wants to ensure that even if there is a disruption in service at the capital, other services should not be affected. The government has data on the cost of laying fiber optic cables between every pair of cities. Write a program that allows the government to determine the minimum cost it has to incur in laying additional cables to fulfil the requirement. 
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of cities in Siruseri. You may assume that the capital city is always numbered $1$.  - This is followed by $N$ lines of input each containing $N$ integers.  - The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i$ is the cost of connecting city $i$ with city $j$. The $j^{th}$ integer on line $i$ will be the same as the $i^{th}$ integer on line $j$ (since the links are bidirectional) and the $i^{th}$ entry on line $i$ will always be $0$ (there is no cost in connecting a city with itself). -----Output:----- A single integer indicating the minimum total cost of the links to be added to ensure that disruption of services at one city does not disconnect the rest of the cities. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 2000$. - $0 \leq$ costs given in the input $\leq 100000$ -----Sample Input----- 4 0 7 8 10 7 0 4 5  8 4 0 6 10 5 6 0 -----Sample Output----- 9
