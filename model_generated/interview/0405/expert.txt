 You are given two integers K and W. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to N W in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to N W appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. 
Example 1: Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10 Output: 1.00000 Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops. Example 2: Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10 Output: 0.60000 Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops. In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points. Example 3: Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10 Output: 0.73278 Note: 0 <= K <= N <= 10000 1 <= W <= 10000 Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.
