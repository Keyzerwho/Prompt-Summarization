 You are given two integers $a$ and $b$. You need to find the time in minutes during which Polycarp will not be in the coverage area of the network, with a rectilinear uniform movement from $x=a$ to $x=b$. His speed 1 unit of distance per minute. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. In the following lines are written $t$ test cases. The description of each test case is one line, which contains four integers $a$, $b$, $c$ and $r$ ($-10^8 \le a,b,c \le 10^8$, $0 \le r \le 10^8$) — the coordinates of the starting and ending points of the path, the base station, and its coverage radius, respectively. Any of the numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$ can be equal (either any pair or all three numbers). The base station can be located both on the route of Polycarp and outside it. -----Output----- Print $t$ numbers — answers to given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer — the number of minutes during which Polycarp will be unavailable during his movement. -----Example----- Input 9 1 10 7 1 3 3 3 0 8 2 10 4 8 2 10 100 -10 20 -17 2 -3 2 2 0 -3 1 2 0 2 3 2 3 -1 3 -2 2 Output 7 0 4 0 30 5 4 0 3 -----Note----- The following picture illustrates the first test case.  [Image] Polycarp goes from $1$ to $10$. The yellow area shows the coverage area of the station with a radius of coverage of $1$, which is located at the point of $7$. The green area shows a part of the path when Polycarp is out of coverage area.
