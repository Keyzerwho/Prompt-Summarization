 You are given a string A. You are asked to find the number of good substrings. A substring A[L, R] is good if: -  The length of the substring is exactly 2 and AL = AR, OR - The length of the substring is greater than 2,AL = AR and the substring A[L + 1, R - 1] has only one distinct letter. Anyways, Ahmed struggled trying to find a solution for the problem. Since his mathematical skills are very poor as it turned out, he decided to cheat and contacted you asking for your help. Can you help him in this challenge 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains the integer T, indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines, contains a string A. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing a single number, indicating the number of good substrings. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100  - 1 ≤  |A|  ≤ 105  -  It's guaranteed that the sum of  |A|  over all test cases doesn't exceed 5x105.  -----Example----- Input: 2 a abba Output: 0 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 2. The good substrings of abba are: { bb } and { abba }.
