 you are given a string $s$ consisting of $n$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1. You can perform operations on the string. Each operation consists of two steps:  select an integer $i$ from $1$ to the length of the string $s$, then delete the character $s_i$ (the string length gets reduced by $1$, the indices of characters to the right of the deleted one also get reduced by $1$);  if the string $s$ is not empty, delete the maximum length prefix consisting of the same characters (the indices
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the length of the string $s$. The second line contains string $s$ of $n$ characters. Each character is either 0 or 1. It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ over test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of operations you can perform. -----Example----- Input 5 6 111010 1 0 1 1 2 11 6 101010 Output 3 1 1 1 3 -----Note----- In the first test case, you can, for example, select $i = 2$ and get string 010 after the first operation. After that, you can select $i = 3$ and get string 1. Finally, you can only select $i = 1$ and get empty string.
