 You are given N horses, their skill S[i] and an integer N.  You need to find the minimum difference in their skill S[i] such that their skill S[i] is comparable. 
-----Input:----- First line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Every test case starts with a line containing the integer N. The next line contains N space separated integers where the i-th integer is S[i]. -----Output:----- For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum difference that is possible. -----Constraints:----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 2 ≤ N ≤ 5000 1 ≤ S[i] ≤ 1000000000 -----Example:-----Input: 1 5 4 9 1 32 13 Output: 3 Explanation: The minimum difference can be achieved if we pick horses with skills 1 and 4 for the race.
