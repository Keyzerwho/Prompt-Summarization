 You are given integer `n` determining set S = {1, 2, ..., n}. Determine if the number of k-element subsets of S is `ODD` or `EVEN` for given integer k. Example 1: Input: n = 3, k = 2 Output: ODD Example 2: Input: n = 2, k = 1 Output: EVEN Don't bother with naive solution - numbers here are really big.
