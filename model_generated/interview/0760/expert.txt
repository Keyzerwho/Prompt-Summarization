 You are given a string A consisting of n lower case English letters.  Sereja calls two strings X and Y each of length n similar if they can be made equal by applying the following operation at most once in each of them. - Chose any two position i, j in the string (i can be equal to j too). Swap the characters at position i with character at position j. For example strings "abcd" and "acbd" are similar, strings "ab" and "ab" are similar, but strings "abcde" and "bcdea" are not similar.
-----Input----- - First line contain integer T - number of test cases.  - For each of the next T lines:  	 - Each line contains a string A as defined in the problem. -----Output----- For each test case, output answer modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7) in separate line.  -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤  10  - 1 ≤ n ≤  10^5  -----Constraints----- - Subtask #1: 1 ≤ n ≤  10  (25 points) - Subtask #2: 1 ≤ n ≤  100  (25 points) - Subtask #3: 1 ≤ n ≤  1000  (25 points) - Subtask #4: original constraints (25 points) -----Example----- Input: 2 z abcd Output: 0 144
