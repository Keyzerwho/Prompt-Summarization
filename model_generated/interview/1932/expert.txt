 Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n. Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.
Example 1: Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3 Output: true Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.   Constraints: root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n. n is odd. 1 <= x <= n <= 100
