 You are given l and r. For all integers from l to r, inclusive, we wrote down all of their integer divisors except 1. Find the integer that we wrote down the maximum number of times. Solve the problem to show that it's not a NP problem. summary :  
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” $1$ if Vanja (the first player) is the winner or $2$ if Miksi (the second player) is the winner. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 50$ - $1 \le N \le 3 \cdot 10^4$ - $0 \le K \le 3 \cdot 10^4$ - $0 \le A_i \le 1$ for each valid $i$ -----Example Input----- 2 2 1 1 0 3 5 0 1 0 -----Example Output----- 1 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: $K = 1$, so if Vanja replaces the first $*$ by $+$, the value of the final expression will be $V = 1$; then, $K \le |V|$, so the winner is Vanja. Example case 2: $K = 5$, but the absolute value of the final expression cannot be greater than $1$. The winner is Miksi.
