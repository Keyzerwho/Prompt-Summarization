 You are given two series like 1^2+2.2^2+3^2+2.4^2+5^2+2.6^2+...........  and 1^2+2.3^2+3^2+2.5^2+5^2+2.6^2+..........  . 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $n$, number of terms  in the given series. -----Output:----- Output single line "Ravi" if he solve more questions or "Jhon" if he solve more questions. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq n \leq 100$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 3    -----Sample Output:----- Jhon        Ravi        -----EXPLANATION:----- In the first test cases  sum of 2 terms is 9 (according to the given series) which is an odd number   so Jhon will solve 2 more questions and Ravi will not attempt more questions. In second test case sum of 3 terms is 18 (according to the given series) which is an  even number according to the given series  so Ravi will solve 3 more questions and Jhon will not attempt more questions.
