 You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. Example 1: Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1 Output: 6 Explanation: There are 6 possible combinations. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. - The second line contains $N - 1$ space-separated integers $A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of graphs modulo $10^9 + 7$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 1,000$ - $2 \le N \le 10^5$ - $N-1 \le M \le \mathrm{min}\left(2\cdot 10^5, \frac{N(N-1)}{2}\right)$ - $1 \le A_i \le N-1$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ - the sum of $M$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (50 points): $M = N-1$ Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 4 3 1 2 1 4 6 1 2 1 3 2 2 2 -----Example Output----- 2 0 0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: The two graphs which satisfy all conditions are:
