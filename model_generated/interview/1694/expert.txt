 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizontal line. the first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2$-nd second,
-----Input----- Same as the easy version. -----Output----- Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input, containing your (integer) population estimate. Your answer is considered correct if it is an integer that falls into the interval $[ \lfloor 0.95 \cdot P \rfloor, \lceil 1.05 \cdot P \rceil ]$, where P is the real population of the village, used to create the distribution (either Poisson or uniform) from which the marmots drew their answers.
