 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $M$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. The next line contains $M$ distinct positive integers describing the sequence in which the books are arranged on the library shelf. The third line of input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of entries in the register. This, in turn, is followed by $N$ lines (lines $4$ to $N+3$), each containing one positive integer. The integer on line $3+i$ indicates the position from left of the book ith book borrowed. (You may assume that the number on line $3+i$ is at most $M-i+1$.) -----Output:----- $N$ lines with one positive integer on each line. The number on line $i$ is the book borrowed by the ith borrower. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq M \leq 1000000$. - $1 \leq N \leq 4000$. -----Sample Input----- 5 26 1 42 15 3  2 3 4 -----Sample Output----- 42 3
