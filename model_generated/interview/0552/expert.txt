 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input:----- The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains two space-separated integers N and K. The next line contains N space-separated integers W1, W2, ..., WN. -----Output:----- For each test case, output the maximum possible difference between the weights carried by both in grams. -----Constraints:----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ K < N ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ Wi ≤ 100000 (105) -----Example:----- Input: 2 5 2 8 4 5 2 10 8 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output: 17 2 -----Explanation:----- Case #1: The optimal way is that Chef gives his son K=2 items with weights 2 and 4. Chef carries the rest of the items himself. Thus the difference is: (8+5+10) − (4+2) = 23 − 6 = 17. Case #2: Chef gives his son 3 items and he carries 5 items himself.
