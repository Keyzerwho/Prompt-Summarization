 You are given a convex polygon with vertices $P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{n-1}$ and points $R_i$ on edges $P_{i} P_{(i+1) \% n}$. 
-----Input----- - The first line contains $n$, the number of vertices in the convex polygon. - The next $n$ lines contain the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon in anti-clockwise order.  -----Output----- For each testcase, print the expected area of the convex hull of the $n$ randomly chosen points. -----Constraints----- - $3 \leq n \leq 10^5$ - The absolute values of all the coordinates $\leq 10^7$. - All the points in the input are distinct. - The described polygon $P$ is convex and the vertices of the polygon are given in anti-clockwise order. Also, no three vertices of the polygon are collinear. -----Example Input----- 3 0 0 1 0 0 1 -----Example Output----- 0.1250000000
