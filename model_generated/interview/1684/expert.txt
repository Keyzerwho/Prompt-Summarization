 Sugreev needs to make an array $A$ of length $N$, such that $\sum A$i$^3 = X^2$, to prove the purity of the bond of his friendship with Ram. Sugreev is facing difficulty in forming the array. So, help Sugreev to form this array.
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then, the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains a single line of input, integer $N$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line, array $A$ of $N$ integers, where each element is between $1$ to $1000$ (both inclusive), satisfying the equation $\sum A$i$^3 = X^2$, where $X$ is "any" integer. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^3$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 1 6 -----Sample Output:----- 4 5 10 5 10 5 5
