 A string S is a W string if and only if it satisfies the following conditions (some terms and notations are explained in Note, please see it if you cannot understand): - The string S contains exactly 3 '#' characters. Let the indexes of all '#' be P1 < P2 < P3 (indexes are 0-origin). - Each substring of S[0, P1 1], S[P1+1, P2 1], S[P2+1, P3 1], S[P3+1
-----Input----- First line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow. Each line contains a string S. -----Output----- Output an integer, denoting the length of the longest W string as explained before. If S has no W string as its subsequence, then output 0. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100  - 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 (104) - S contains no characters other than lower English characters ('a' to 'z') and '#' (without quotes) -----Example----- Input: 3 aaaaa#bb#cc#dddd acb#aab#bab#accba abc#dda#bb#bb#aca Output: 16 10 11 -----Explanation----- In the first case: the whole string forms a W String. In the second case: acb#aab#bab#accba, the longest W string is acb#aab#bab#accba In the third case: abc#dda#bb#bb#aca, note that even though abc#dda#bb#bb#aca (boldened characters form the subsequence) is a W string of length 12, it violates Ryuk's condition that there should not be any #'s inbetween the 3 chosen # positions. One correct string of length 11 is abc#dda#bb#bb#aca
