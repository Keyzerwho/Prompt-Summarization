 You are given $N$ kid cyborgs, $K$ weapons, and a rule : the difference between kid cyborg having the maximum weapons and the kid cyborg having minimum weapons should be less than or equal to $1$. Find the value of the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg can have when all the $K$ weapons are distributed among them. 
-----Input:----- - The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. - Each of the next $T$ lines will contain two space-separated integers denoting $N$ and $K$ respectively. -----Output:----- - For each test case ,output a single line containing an integer $X$ denoting the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg can have in that test case.   -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq K \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 5 8 -----Expected Output:----- 1 -----Explanation----- - There are $5$ kids and $8$ weapons.   - Hence we will distribute the weapons such that $3$ kids have $2$ weapons each and the remaining $2$ kids have $1$ weapon each.   - Hence the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg has is $1$. (  That is, $min(1,2)$ = $1$ )
