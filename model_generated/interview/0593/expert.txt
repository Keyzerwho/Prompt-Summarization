 You are given an array $T$ containing n + 1 characters, where each character is in the range [0, 1], and $|T| = n + 1$. Your task is to find the minimum cost of turning $T$ into a pangram. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input file will contain one integer, T, representing the number of tests. Each test will be formed from two lines. The first one contains 26 space-separated integers, representing the prices of all letters. The second will contain Mathison's initial text (a string of N lowercase letters). -----Output----- The output file will contain T lines, one for each test. Each line will contain the answer for the corresponding test. -----Constraints and notes----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000 - All prices are natural numbers between 1 and 1,000,000 (i.e. 106). - A pangram is a string that contains every letter of the Latin alphabet at least once. - All purchased letters are added to the end of the string. -----Subtaks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): - N = 1 Subtask #2 (70 points): - Original constraints -----Example----- Input: 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwz 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog Output: 63 0 -----Explanation----- First test There are three letters missing from the original string: n (price 14), x (price 24), and y (price 25). Therefore the answer is 14 + 24 + 25 = 63. Second test No letter is missing so there is no point in buying something. The answer is 0.
