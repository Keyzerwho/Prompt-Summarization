 You are given a set of integers, you need to find the sum of alternate consecutive d$d$ odd numbers from the range L$L$ to R$R$ inclusive. if d$d$ is 3 and L$L$ is 10 and R$R$ is 34, then the odd numbers between 10 and 34 are 11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33$11,13,15,17,19,21,
Note:$Note:$ Number of odd number between L$L$ and R$R$ (both inclusive) is a multiple of d$d$. -----Input:----- - First line will contain T$T$, number of test cases.   - First line of each test case contains one integer d$d$ .  - Second line of each test case contains two space separated integer L$L$ and R$R$. -----Output:----- For each test case, print the sum modulo 1000000007. -----Constraints:----- - 1≤T≤106$1 \leq T \leq 10^6$ - 1≤d≤103$1 \leq d \leq 10^3$ - 1≤L<R≤106$1 \leq L < R \leq 10^6$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 3  10 33 -----Sample Output:----- 114 -----EXPLANATION:----- Sum of alternate odd numbers i.e, 11,13,15,23,25,27 is 114
