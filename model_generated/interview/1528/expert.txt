 You are given $N$ coins numbered $1$ through $N$. You need to perform $K$ operations. In each operation, you should remove the rightmost coin present on the table. If this coin was showing heads, then you should flip all the remaining coins. The code required to enter the temple is the number of coins which, after these $K$ operations are performed, have not been removed and are showing heads. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated characters. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these characters is 'H' if the $i$-th coin is initially showing heads or 'T' if it is showing tails. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of coins that are showing heads after $K$ operations. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 200$ - $1 \le K < N \le 100$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 5 3 H T T H T 7 4 H H T T T H H 6 1 T H T H T T -----Example Output----- 1 2 2
