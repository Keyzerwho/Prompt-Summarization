 You are given a list of numbers. You are asked to find Armstrong numbers among them. 
-----Input:----- First line will contain a positive Integer $T$ which is the number of testcases Next $T$ lines follows an Integer $N$. -----Output:----- For Every n You have to print "FEELS GOOD" without qoutes if it is an armstrong number otherwise Print "FEELS BAD" without quotes -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $2 \leq N \leq 10^6$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 153 11 1634 -----Sample Output:----- FEELS GOOD FEELS BAD FEELS GOOD -----EXPLANATION:----- For test case 1 --> 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 (153 is an armstrong number)
