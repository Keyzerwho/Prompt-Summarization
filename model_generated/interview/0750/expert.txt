 Given a permutation, your task is to check whether it is ambiguous or not. 
-----Input Specification----- The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Then a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers. You can assume that every integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the permutation. The last test case is followed by a zero. -----Output Specification----- For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output. -----Sample Input----- 4 1 4 3 2 5 2 3 4 5 1 1 1 0 -----Sample Output----- ambiguous not ambiguous ambiguous
