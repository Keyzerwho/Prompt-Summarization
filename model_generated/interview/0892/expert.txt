 
-----Input:----- - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.  - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1$,$A_2$,â€¦,$A_N$ -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line minimum steps or $-1$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $1 \leq N \leq 2*10^5$ - $1 \leq K \leq N$ - $0 \leq A_i \leq 10^6$ - $\text{the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed $5*10^{5}$}$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 2 2 3 4 -----Sample Output:----- 2  -----EXPLANATION:----- in the first step, you can jump into any cell 1 or 2 and then in the second step you will jump  out to the right side of 2nd cell remember we don't want to reach $Nth$ cell we want to reach the right side of the nth cell.
