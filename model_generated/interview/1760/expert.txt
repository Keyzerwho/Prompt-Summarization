 You are given a chess board. Your task is to count the number of empty squares. The smallest size of the square is 2 x 2 and the biggest size of the square is n x n, where n is the size of the board.  A square can overlap the part of other squares. For example: If ``` chessBoard=[   [1,1,1],   [1,1,1],   [1,1,1] ] ``` ...there are four 2 x 2 squares in the chess board:
Example For  ``` chessBoard = [   [1,1],   [1,1] ] ``` the output should be `{2:1}`. For  ``` chessBoard = [   [0,1],   [1,1] ] ``` the output should be `{}`. For  ``` chessBoard = [   [1,1,1],   [1,1,1],   [1,1,1] ] ``` the output should be `{2:4,3:1}`. For  ``` chessBoard = [   [1,1,1],   [1,0,1],   [1,1,1] ] ``` the output should be `{}`.
