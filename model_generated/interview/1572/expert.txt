 Indian National Olympiad in Informatics 2016  Boing Inc, has N employees, numbered 1 ... N.

-----Input format----- 	There will be one line which contains (2*N + 1) space-separate integers. The first integer is N, giving the number of employees in the company. The next N integers A[1], .., A[N] give the wealth of the N employees. The last N integers are P[1], P[2], .., P[N], where P[i] identifies the manager of employee i. If Mr. Hojo is employee i then, P[i] = -1, indicating that he has no manager. -----Output format----- 	One integer, which is the needed answer. -----Test data----- -108 ≤ A[i] ≤ 108, for all i. Subtask 1 (30 Marks) 1 ≤ N ≤ 500. Subtask 2 (70 Marks) 1 ≤ N ≤ 105. -----Sample Input----- 4 5 10 6 12 2 -1 4 2 -----Sample Output----- 6
