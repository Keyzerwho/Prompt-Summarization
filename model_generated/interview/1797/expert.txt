 Write a function to compute the *n*th smallest Hamming number.  Specifically: - The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 2^(0)3^(0)5^(0) - The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 2^(1)3^(0)5^(0) - The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 2^(0)3^(1)5^(0) - The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 =
