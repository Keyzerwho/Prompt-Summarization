 You are given three integers R, G, and B. You should construct an array such that, after performing M magic tricks, the amount of liquid in Red, Green and Blue colored potions will be minimized. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case, we have four lines. The first line contains four space separated integers R, G, B, M. The next 3 lines will describe the amount of different color liquids (r, g, b), which are separated by space. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single integer denoting the answer of the problem. -----Constraints----- -  1 ≤ T ≤ 1000  -  1 ≤ R, G, B, M ≤ 100  -  1 ≤ r[i], g[i], b[i] ≤ 10^9  -----Example----- Input: 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 1 1 1 1 2 4 6 3 2 2 2 1 2 3 2 4 6 8 Output: 2 4 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Magical girl can pick the blue potion and make its liquid amount half. So the potions will now have amounts 1 2 1. Maximum of these values is 2. Hence answer is 2.
