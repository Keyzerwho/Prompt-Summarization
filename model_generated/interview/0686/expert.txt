 You are given two numbers N and M and an elevator and stairs. You have to decide whether Chef should take the elevator or the stairs to minimize his travel time.  
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a single line containing three space-separated integers N, V1, V2.  -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line with string Elevator or Stairs, denoting the answer to the problem. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤  1000  - 1 ≤ N, V1, V2 ≤  100  -----Example----- Input: 3 5 10 15 2 10 14 7 14 10 Output: Elevator Stairs Stairs
