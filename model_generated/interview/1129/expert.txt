 You are given a list of $N$ integers and positive integer $M$. Find the number of ways in which Chef can construct a Love Graph. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.  - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $M$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of ways in which Chef can construct a Love Graph modulo $10^9+7$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $2 \leq N \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq M \leq 10^{18}$ -----Subtasks----- - 30 points: - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $2 \leq N \leq 10$ - $1 \leq M \leq 10$  - 70 points: original constraints -----Sample Input----- 1 2 1    -----Sample Output----- 2    -----Explanation----- There are two ways of constructing Love Graph. In first way, we pick Vertex 1 and then join with Vertex 2. In second way, we pick Vertex 2 and then join with Vertex 1.
