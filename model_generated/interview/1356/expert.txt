 Chef is good at making pancakes. Generally he gets requests to serve N pancakes at once. He serves them in the form of a stack. A pancake can be treated as a circular disk with some radius. Chef needs to take care that when he places a pancake on the top of the stack the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than 1.  Additionally all radii should be positive integers, and the bottom most pancake should have its radius as 1. Chef wants you to find out in how many ways can he create a stack containing N pancakes. Input First line of the input contains T (T <= 1000)
