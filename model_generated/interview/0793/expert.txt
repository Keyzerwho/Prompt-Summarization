 You are given a list of $n$ points, $P = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$. Each point $x_i$ is its location in the coordinate plane. Your task is to find the maximum possible distance $d$ between any two points in the list. Your program should answer $n$ independent test cases. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $n$ and $R$, number of houses that need delivery and the correct coordinate of chef (Drone). - Second line contains $n$ integers , the coordinate of all homes that need delivery.  -----Output:----- - The maximum value of $x$ , so that drone delivers to all houses. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq n \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq R \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq hi \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq x  \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 1 3 5 11 -----Sample Output:----- 2 -----EXPLANATION:----- Chef's drone is at 1 initially and he needs to visit 3,5,11 , so optimal solution will be (maximum value of x ) equal to 2.
