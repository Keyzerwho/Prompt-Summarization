 You are given an integer N. You need to report whether the prodigy wins the game or not. If he wins, also output his answer. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains T (T ≤ 25), the number of test cases. Following this are T lines, each containing an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 109) - the number which is given to the prodigy. -----Output----- Output one line per test case. If the smallest integer X with more than N factors is bigger than 1019 so that the prodigy does not win, print "lose". Otherwise print "win X" (quotes for clarity). -----Example----- Input: 3 3 5 12345678 Output: win 6 win 12 lose
