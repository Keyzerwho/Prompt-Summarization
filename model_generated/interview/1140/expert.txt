 You are given an array $a$. You need to calculate an array $c$, where $c[i]$ is the index at $i$th element, such that $c[i]$ is equal to $order(a, i)$. 
-----Input Format:----- - The first line contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows. - Each testcase is described by a single line with two integers: $p$ and $idx$, where $p$ is the parameter that determines the length of the array $a$ and $idx$ is the index at which you have to report the value in the output of $order(a, 0)$. -----Output Format:----- - You should print the answer in a new line for each testcase, which should be a single integer, the element at index $idx$ after executing $order(a, 0)$ for the array $a$ defined by the parameter $p$. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$  - $1 \leq p \leq 50$ - $0 \leq idx \leq 2^p-1$ -----SUBTASKS:----- - Subtask 1: 20% points : $1 \leq p \leq 20$ - Subtask 2: 80% points: Original constraints -----Sample Input:----- 2 3 3 3 7 -----Sample Output:----- 6 7 -----Explanation:----- Both the testcases have been explained in the problem statement.
