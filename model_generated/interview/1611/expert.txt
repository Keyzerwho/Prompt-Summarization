 You are given a string. Split it into an array of strings. 
Examples ``` p1F2RF2LqP1         =>  should return [0, 0], no infinite recursion detected p1F2RP1F2LqP1       =>  should return [1, 1], infinite recursion detection case P2p1P2qp2P1q        =>  should return [2, 2], single mutual infinite recursion case p1P2qP3p2P3qp3P1q   =>  should return [3, 3], twice mutual infinite recursion case p1P2P1qp2P3qp3P1qP1 =>  should return [1, 3], mixed infinite recursion case ```
