 You are given an integer $A$ and an integer $B$. You have to tell Appy whether they are going to win or lose. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $N$, $A$, $B$ and $K$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Win" if they can solve at least $K$ problems or "Lose" otherwise (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 15$ - $1 \le K \le N \le 10^{18}$ - $1 \le A, B \le 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (15 points): - $1 \le T \le 15$ - $1 \le K \le N \le 10^6$ - $1 \le A, B \le 10^3$ Subtask #2 (85 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 6 2 3 3 -----Example Output----- Win -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Appy is solving the problems with codes $2$ and $4$, Chef is solving the problem with code $3$. Nobody is solving problem $6$, since $6$ is divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Therefore, they can solve $3$ problems and win.
