 You are given $K$ players and $N$ passes. The coach knows that if $K$ passes are performed between the players, then Lionel Andres Messi will end up with the ball. (Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi after exactly $N$ passes are performed between all the $K$+1 players, i.e. Messi can receive the ball several times during the $N$ passes. See the 2nd test case explanation for further clarification. )  However, he realized that there are many scenarios possible for this, so he asked you, his assistant coach, to tell him in how many ways can Messi score the important
-----Input----- Input will contain a number T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow, each one consisting of two space-sparated integers N and K. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways the winning play might happen modulo 1000000007 (109+7). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 2 ≤ N ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ K ≤ 10 -----Example----- Input: 2 2 4 4 2 Output: 4 6 -----Explanation----- In the first test case, say four players with Messi are Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Jordi Alba. Then the ways of the winning play to happen when exactly  2 passes are to be performed are: 1) Messi - Xavi - Messi 2) Messi - Busquets - Messi 3) Messi - Iniesta - Messi 4) Messi - Alba - Messi In the second test case, also say that two players with Messi are Xavi and Iniesta. There are 6 ways for the winning play to happen when exactly 4 passes are performed. All the examples of such winning play are: 1) Messi - Xavi - Messi - Iniesta - Messi 2) Messi - Xavi - Iniesta - Xavi - Messi 3) Messi - Xavi - Messi - Xavi - Messi 4) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Iniesta - Messi 5) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Xavi - Messi 6) Messi - Iniesta - Xavi - Iniesta - Messi
