 You have N people sitting around a large pizza. To make it more interesting, you make some pairs among these N people and the two persons in a pair, feed each other. Each person should be a part of at most one pair and most importantly, to make feeding easy, any two pairs should not cross each other (see figure for more clarity). 
-----Input----- First line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 1000 ). Each of the next T lines contains an integer N ( 2 <= N <= 10000 ) -----Output----- For each test case, output the name of the winner ( either "Arjuna" or "Bhima" ( without quotes ) ) in a new line. -----Example----- Input: 4 2 4 5 6 Output: Arjuna Arjuna Bhima Arjuna Explanation: Let the people around the table are numbered 1, 2, ... , N in clock-wise order as shown in the image  Case 1 : N = 2. Only two persons and Arjuna makes the only possible pair (1,2) Case 2 : N = 4. Arjuna can make the pair (1,3). Bhima can not make any more pairs ( without crossing the pair (1,3) ) Case 3 : N = 5. No matter which pair Arjuna makes first, Bhima can always make one more pair, and Arjuna can not make any further
