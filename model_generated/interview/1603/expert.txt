 Given a list of page addresses being queried. You have to find the groups of server names that correspond to one website.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of page queries. Then follow n lines each containing exactly one address. Each address is of the form http://<hostname>[/<path>], where:   <hostname> consists of lowercase English letters and dots, there are no two consecutive dots, <hostname> doesn't start or finish with a dot. The length of <hostname> is positive and doesn't exceed 20.  <path> consists of lowercase English letters, dots and slashes. There are no two consecutive slashes, <path> doesn't start with a slash and its length doesn't exceed 20.  Addresses are not guaranteed to be distinct. -----Output----- First print k — the number of groups of server names that correspond to one website. You should count only groups of size greater than one. Next k lines should contain the description of groups, one group per line. For each group print all server names separated by a single space. You are allowed to print both groups and names inside any group in arbitrary order. -----Examples----- Input 10 http://abacaba.ru/test http://abacaba.ru/ http://abacaba.com http://abacaba.com/test http://abacaba.de/ http://abacaba.ru/test http://abacaba.de/test http://abacaba.com/ http://abacaba.com/t http://abacaba.com/test Output 1 http://abacaba.de http://abacaba.ru  Input 14 http://c http://ccc.bbbb/aba..b http://cba.com http://a.c/aba..b/a http://abc/ http://a.c/ http://ccc.bbbb http://ab.ac.bc.aa/ http://a.a.a/ http://ccc.bbbb/ http://cba.com/ http://cba.com/aba..b http://a.a.a/aba..b/a http://abc/aba..b/a Output 2 http://cba.com http://ccc.bbbb  http://a.a.a http://a.c http://abc
