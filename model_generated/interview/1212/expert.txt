 The word "balance" contains 5 letters, so there are 5 possible replacements. The operation "choose one letter and replace it by another" can be repeated any number of times, so there are 5*5=25 possible operations. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the minimum number of operations. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10,000$ - $1 \le |S| \le 1,000,000$ - the sum of $|S|$ over all test cases does not exceed $5,000,000$ - $S$ contains only uppercase English letters -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): - $T \le 10$ - $|S| \le 18$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 ABCB BBC -----Example Output----- 1 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: We can change 'C' to 'A'. The resulting string is "ABAB", which is a balanced string, since the number of occurrences of 'A' is equal to the number of occurrences of 'B'. Example case 2: We can change 'C' to 'B' to make the string "BBB", which is a balanced string.
