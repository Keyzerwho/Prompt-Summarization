 You are given a sequence of numbers. You need to rearrange elements of this sequence in such a way that it can match a possible Chef's game in the order of the numbers written on the board. I.e. each next number will be exactly two times the previous number or exactly one-third of the previous number. 
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains an integer number N i.e the number of the elements in the sequence.  - The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a1,a2,…, an i.e rearranged (reordered) sequence that Chef can write down on the iPad. -----Output:----- Print N integer numbers — rearranged (reordered) input sequence that can be the sequence that Chef could write down on the iPad. It is guaranteed that the answer exists -----Constraints----- - $2 \leq N \leq 100$ - $1 \leq A[i] \leq  3* 10^{18} $ -----Sample Input:----- 6 4 8 6 3 12 9 -----Sample Output:----- 9 3 6 12 4 8  -----EXPLANATION:----- In the first example, the given sequence can be rearranged in the following way: [9,3,6,12,4,8]. It can match possible Polycarp's game which started with x=9.
