 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input consists of single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a string. -----Output:----- For each test case print a single integer - the total number of ways to decode the digit string. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $2 \leq S \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 12 226 -----Sample Output:----- 2 3 -----EXPLANATION:----- There are 2 possible ways. It could be decoded as "AB" {1,2} or "L" {12}. There are 3 possible ways. It could be decoded as "BZ" {2,26}, "VF" {22,6}, or "BBF" {2,2,6}.
