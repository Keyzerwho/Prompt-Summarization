 Return all non-negative integers of length n such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is k. Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros except for the number 0 itself. For example, 01 has one leading zero and is invalid, but 0 is valid. You may return the answer in any order.   Example 1: Input: n = 3, k = 7 Output: [181,292,707,818,929] Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes. Example 2:
