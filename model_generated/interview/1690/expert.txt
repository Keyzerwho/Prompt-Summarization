 You are given a list of integers. You want to count the number of people in the extended family of the president.
-----Input format----- • Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N followed by K. • Lines 2 to N + 1: Each line describes an id of one of the residents of Sequence Land, beginning with the President on line 2. Each line consists of an integer p, followed by p distinct integers, the id. -----Output format----- The output consists of a single integer, the number of people in the extended family of the President. -----Test Data----- The testdata is grouped into two subtasks. In both subtasks, 1 ≤ N ≤ 300 and 1 ≤ K ≤ 300. Each number in each id is between 0 and 109 inclusive. • Subtask 1 [30 points]: The number of elements in each id is between 1 and 10 inclusive. • Subtask 2 [70 points]: The number of elements in each id is between 1 and 300 inclusive. -----Example----- Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above. -----Sample input ----- 4 2 4 4 6 7 8 4 8 3 0 4 2 0 10 6 1 2 3 0 5 8 -----Sample output----- 3 Note: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format. Please remove all diagnostic print statements before making your final submission. A program with extraneous output will be treated as incorrect!
