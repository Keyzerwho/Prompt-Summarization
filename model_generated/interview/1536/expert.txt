 Istiak wrote an arithmetic sequence, but his friend Rafsan ruined it. Help him recover the original sequence. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_N$. It is guaranteed that a valid solution exists. -----Constraints----- - $4 \le N \le 10^5$ - $|a_i| \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ -----Example Input----- 3 4 1 3 10 7 5 -10 -5 0 5 10 4 2 2 2 10 -----Example Output----- 1 3 5 7 -10 -5 0 5 10 2 2 2 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Rafsan changed the third element from $5$ to $10$. Example case 2: No elements were changed. Example case 3: Rafsan changed the fourth element from $2$ to $10$.
