 You are given a string S = S1...SN, where S is a string of capital letters and question marks, and SN is the number of substrings equal to "CHEF". The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. In particular, A is lexicographically smaller than B if A1 < B1. We compare capital letters by their positions
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a string S. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the content of the signboard Chef Ciel will come up with. That is you should output the lexicographically smallest string that could be obtained from the input string by replacing all its question marks by some capital letters and having as many substrings equal to "CHEF" as possible. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 2013 - 1 ≤ length of S ≤ 2013 - Each character in S is either a capital letter from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, or the question mark '?'. -----Example----- Input: 5 ????CIELIS???E? ????CIELISOUR???F T?KEITE?SY ???????? ???C??? Output: CHEFCIELISACHEF CHEFCIELISOURCHEF TAKEITEASY CHEFCHEF AAACHEF -----Explanation ----- Example Case 1. Here the resulting string can have at most 2 substrings equal to "CHEF". For example, some possible such strings are: - CHEFCIELISACHEF - CHEFCIELISQCHEF - CHEFCIELISZCHEF However, lexicographically smallest one is the first one. Example Case 3. Here the resulting string cannot have "CHEF" as its substring. Therefore, you must simply output the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from the given one by replacing question marks with capital letters.
