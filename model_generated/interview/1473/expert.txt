 =====Problem Statement===== Chef is cutting a V shaped cake into 3 pieces. She can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, from end to end. That is, she cannot cut the cake partially. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single line containing five space separated integers R, C M, K and J. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ R, C ≤ 109 - 1 ≤ M, K, J ≤ 1018 -----Example----- Input:4 4 5 10 4 6 4 5 6 10 4 4 5 4 6 10 2 2 2 2 2 Output:Yes Yes Yes No -----Explanation----- Example case 1. In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by doing the following slicing.   pre tt _ _ _ _ _       _ _ _ _ _       _ _ _ _ _       _________  |         |     |         |     |         |     |M M M M M| |         | -- |_ _ _ _ _| -- |_ _ _ _ _| -- |M_M_M_M_M| |         |     |         |     |     |   |     |J J J|K K| |_ _ _ _ _|     |_ _ _ _ _|     |_ _ _|_ _|     |J_J_J|K_K| /tt /pre I'll make an image if I have time  Example case 4. Here, Michael, Kevin and Jake each wants a piece with area 2, but the total area of the cake is only 2×2 = 4. This means the task is impossible.
