 You have two ships M and N (not necessarily different). You have to find the number of pairs (x, y) such that 1<=x<=M and 1<=y<=N. (x, y) satisfy the condition $x*y + x+ y = string(x)+string(y)$. Calculate the number of distinct x satisfying the given condition.
-----Input :----- - First line contains $T$ as number of test cases  - Each test case contains two integers $M$ and $N$  -----Output :----- - For each test case, print two integers - the number of such pairs (x,y) and the number of distinct x -----Constraints :----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000 - 1 ≤  M, N ≤ 10^9 -----Sample Input :----- 1 1 9 -----Sample Output :----- 1 1 -----Explanation :----- For test case two M=1 and N=9  Pair (1,9) satisfies the above condition 1*9+1+9= “19” and only x=1 satisfies the equation.
