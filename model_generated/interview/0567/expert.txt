 Chef's new hobby is painting, but he learned the fact that it's not easy to paint 2D pictures in a hard way. From now on, he decided to paint 1D pictures only. Chef's canvas is N millimeters long and is initially all white. For simplicity, colors will be represented by an integer between 0 and 105. 0 indicates white. The picture he is envisioning is also N millimeters long and the ith millimeter consists purely of the color Ci. Unfortunately, his brush isn't fine enough to paint every millimeter one by one. The brush is 3 millimeters wide and so it can only paint three millimeters at a time with
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the colors of Chef's painting. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing either “Yes” or “No” (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can finish the painting or not. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 3 ≤ N ≤ 105 - The sum of the Ns over all the test cases in a single test file is ≤ 5×105 - 1 ≤ Ci ≤ 105 -----Example----- Input:3 4 1 5 5 5 4 1 1 1 5 3 5 5 2 Output:Yes Yes No -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the first three millimeters with color 1, so the colors become [1,1,1,0], and then the last three millimeters with color 5 so that it becomes [1,5,5,5]. Example case 2. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the last three millimeters by color 5 so the colors become [0,5,5,5], and then the first three millimeters by color 1 so it becomes [1,1,1,5]. Example case 3. In this test case, Chef can only paint the painting as a whole, so all parts must have the same color, and the task is impossible.
