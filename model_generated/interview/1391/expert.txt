 You are given a list of N customers with their arrival time, departure time and the preferred compartment. You need to calculate the maximum number of customers that can dine at the restaurant.
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains two integers N and  K , the number of customers that plan to visit the chef's restaurant and the number of compartments the restaurant is divided into respectively. Each of the next N lines contains three integers si, fi and pi , the arrival time, departure time and the strongly preferred compartment of the ith customer respectively.   Note that the ith customer wants to occupy the pith compartment from [si, fi)  i.e the ith customer leaves just before   fi  so that another customer can occupy that compartment from   fi  onwards. -----Output----- For every test case, print in a single line the maximum number of customers that dine at the restaurant. -----Constraints----- -  1 ≤  T ≤   30  -  0  ≤ N  ≤  105  -  1  ≤  K  ≤  109  -  0  ≤  si < fi ≤   109  -  1  ≤  pi  ≤  K   -----Example----- Input: 2 3 3 1 3 1 4 6 2 7 10 3 4 2 10 100 1 100 200 2 150 500 2 200 300 2 Output: 3 3 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. All three customers want different compartments and hence all 3 can be accommodated. Example case 2. If we serve the 1st, 2nd and 4th customers, then we can get a maximum of 3.
