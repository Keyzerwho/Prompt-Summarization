 You are given a list of events. For each event, you are given the starting date (a positive integer $S$) and the length of the sporting event in days (a positive integer $D$) they plan to organise. Since these requests could overlap it may not be possible to satisfy everyone. Also, there should be at least one gap day between any two approved events, so that the stadium can be cleaned. It is the job of the Manager to decide who gets to use the stadium and who does not. The Manager, being a genial man, would like to keep as many organisations happy as possible and hence would like to allocate the stadium so that maximum number of events are held. Suppose, for example, the
-----Input:----- The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of events for which the Manager has received a request. Lines $2,3,...,N+1$ describe the requirements of the $N$ events. Line $i+1$ contains two integer $S_i$ and $D_i$ indicating the starting date and the duration of event $i$. -----Output:----- Your output must consist of a single line containing a single integer $M$, indicating the maximum possible number of events that can use the stadium. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$. - $1 \leq S_i \leq 1000000$. - $1 \leq D_i \leq 1000$. - $50 \%$ of test cases will also satisfy $1 \leq N \leq 10000$. -----Sample input:----- 4 2 5 9 7 15 6 9 3 -----Sample output:----- 3
