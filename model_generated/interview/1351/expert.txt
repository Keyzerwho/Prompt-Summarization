 The chef is having one array of N natural numbers. He has to place natural numbers on its index of the array. If multiple natural numbers are found for given index place one natural number to its index and ignore others. If any index in the array is empty place 0 at that place. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains two lines of input. - First-line has $N$ denoting the size of an array. - Second-line has $N$ space-separated natural numbers. -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line with the new rearranged array. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$ - $2 \leq N \leq 10^3$ - $arr[i] \leq N-1$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 2 1 1 4 1 1 2 1 -----Sample Output:----- 0 1 0 1 2 0 -----EXPLANATION:----- For 1) $1$ occurs twice in the array hence print 0 at 0th index and 1 at 1st index For 2) $1$ occurs thrice and 2 once in the array hence print 0 at 0th index and 1 at 1st index, 2 at 2nd index and 0 at 3rd index.
