 You are given a sequence of prime numbers A[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output----- Print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of good subsequences with size at most $K$, modulo $1,000,000,007$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le K \le N \le 10^5$ - $2 \le A_i \le 8,000$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (40 points): $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ are pairwise distinct Subtask #2 (60 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 5 3 2 2 3 3 5 -----Example Output----- 18 -----Explanation----- There is $1$ good subsequence with length $0$, $5$ good subsequences with length $1$, $8$ good subsequences with length $2$ and $4$ good subsequences with length $3$.
