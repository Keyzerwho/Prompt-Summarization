 You are given a list of $N$ integers. Return a list of integers in format of "A,B,C,D" where A,D are integers and B,C are integers. A integer is possibly invalid if: the C exceeds 1000, or; if two integers have same A and different D and the difference between C is greater than or equal to 60. Example 1: Input: distances = ["12,10,5,1,1","10,5,12,10","5,12
-----Input:----- - The first line will contain a single integer $T$, the number of test cases. - The first line of each test case will contain two space separated integers - $N$, the number of distances, and $K$, Chefâ€™s step length. - The second line of each test case will contain $N$ space separated integers, the $i^{th}$ of which represents $D_i$, the distance of the $i^{th}$ path. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output a string consisting of $N$ characters. The $i^{th}$ character should be $1$ if the distance is traversable, and $0$ if not.  -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq K \leq 10^9$ - $1 \leq D_i \leq 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- - 100 points : No additional constraints. -----Sample Input:----- 1 5 3 12 13 18 20 27216 -----Sample Output:----- 10101 -----Explanation:----- The first distance can be traversed in $4$ steps. The second distance cannot be traversed. The third distance can be traversed in $6$ steps. The fourth distance cannot be traversed. The fifth distance can be traversed in $9072$ steps.
