 You are given a sequence of steps. You need to remove maximum number of characters from the string such that the resulting string leads to the same destination as before. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - First line of each testcase contains a single integer $N$,size of string.  - Second line of testcase contains a string $s$ of size $N$. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output a single line containing the maximum score possible. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 7 ULUDLLU 4 RUUR 4 LRLR    -----Sample Output:----- 2 0 4     -----EXPLANATION:----- -  test case 1: The final destination after moving according to the sequence is (-3,2). One way is to remove characters at positions 3,4 and the resulting string will be ULLLU and destination still remains (-3,2). -  test case 2: No character can be removed in this case.
