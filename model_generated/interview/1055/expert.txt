 You are given M numbers. The ith number has size Ai. The chef wants to make N straight cuts. Each pizza is of different size and to avoid the slices getting too small the chef can only make a max of Ai cuts to the ith pizza. He wants to maximize the number of slices of pizza. 
-----Input----- First line contains two integers M and N. The second line of input contains the array A. -----Output----- Output a single integer - the maximum number of slices chef can get. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ M ≤ 2*105 - 1 ≤ N,Ai ≤ 2*105 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1: 1 ≤ M,N ≤ 100 - 10 points  - Subtask 2: 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,  1 ≤ M ≤ 105 - 20 points - Subtask 3: Original Constraints - 70 points -----Example----- Input: 5 10 1 2 3 4 5 Output: 31 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. One of the optimal way to cut would be to do {0, 1,  0, 4, 5} cuts.
