 Determine whether Mia will be able to save 300$ from her wages and tips after working $D$ days of the month. If she can, print YES, else print NO. -----Constraints----- - 8 <= D <=30 - 7 <= X <=30 - 4 <= Y <= 20 
-----Input:----- - First line has three parameters $D$, $X$ and $Y$ i.e. number of days worked, minimum wage and highest tip. - Second line contains D integers indicating her shifts every $i$-th day she has worked. -----Output:----- - Print YES, if Mia has saved 300$, NO otherwise. -----Sample Input:----- 9 17 5 1 3 2 4 5 6 1 2 2 -----Sample Output:----- NO -----Explanation:----- No. of days Mia worked (D) is 9, so minimum wage she earns (X) is 17 dollars. Highest tip at first hour (Y) = 5 dollars, 1st day she took 1st shift and 2nd day she took 3rd shift and so on. Upon calculation we will find that Mia was not able to save 300 dollars.
