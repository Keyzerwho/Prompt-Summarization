 You are given n numbers. Each number can be in at most 2 sets. 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of data points in each of Indraneel's student's data sets. This is followed by two lines, each containing $N$ integers. -----Output:----- The output consists of three lines. The first line of output contains a single integer indicating the length of the longest pair of subsequences (one from each sequence) that has identical successive differences. This is followed by two lines each containing the corresponding subsequences. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 150$. - $0 \leq$ Each data point $\leq 1000$ -----Sample Input----- 7 3 8 4 23 9 11 28   2 3 22 26 8 16 12  -----Sample Output----- 4 3 4 23 9 2 3 22 8
