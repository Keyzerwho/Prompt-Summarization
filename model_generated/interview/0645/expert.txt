 Chef has $K$ chocolates and he wants to distribute them to $N$ people (numbered $1$ through $N$). These people are standing in a line in such a way that for each $i$ ($1 \le i \le N-1$), person $i$ and person $i+1$ are adjacent. First, consider some way to distribute chocolates such that for each valid $i$, the number of chocolates the $i$-th person would receive from Chef is $A_i$ and the sum $S_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left|
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains a single integer $K$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the maximum value of the sum $S_2$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10$ - $2 \le N \le 10^5$ - $2 \le K \le 10^{100,000}$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points): $2 \le N, K \le 1,000$ Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 3 2 -----Example Output----- 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: To minimise $S_1$, Chef could give $1$ chocolate to person $1$ and $1$ chocolate to person $2$, so $S_1 = |1-1| + |1-0| = 1$. To maximise $S_2$, Chef can give $1$ chocolate to person $1$ and $1$ chocolate to person $3$, since the sequence $B = (1, 0, 1)$ is a permutation of $A = (1, 1, 0)$. Then, $S_2 = |1-0| + |0-1| = 2$.
