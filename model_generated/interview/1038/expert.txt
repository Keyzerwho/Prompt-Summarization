 You are given the number N of houses on the street. You are also given the number M of guests invited to the party. You are asked to find the number of ways for the Chef to invite people to the party such that the number of guests invited does not exceed M, and none of the guests invited are from three consecutive houses. 
-----Input:----- First line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case contains a line containing a single integer N described above. -----Output:----- For each test case output a single integer denoting the number of ways the brother can go wrong with planning the party. The answer can get quite large. So output the total number of ways modulo 109+7. -----Constraints:----- 1<=T<=10000 1<=N<=1015 -----Example:-----Input: 2 3 4 Output: 1 3 Explanation: Case 1: The only way he can go wrong is by inviting all the houses. Case 2: First way of getting wrong is by inviting houses (1,2,3). Second way to get wrong is by inviting houses (2,3,4). Third way of going wrong is by inviting all 4 houses i.e. (1,2,3,4).
