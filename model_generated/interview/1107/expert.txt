 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A, you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains the pair of integers L and R, separated by a single space. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1,000 - 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1,000,000,000 (10^9) -----Example----- Input: 1 9 12 Output: 75 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. The answer is 9*1 + 10*2 + 11*2 + 12*2 = 75.
