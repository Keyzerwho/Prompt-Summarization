 You are given a list of positive numbers. You are required to find the sum of all the numbers in the list. 
-----Input----- - The first line contains three integers N, K and Q. - The second line contains the integers a, b, c, d, e, f, r, s, t, m, and A[1]. - Then third line contains the integers L1, La, Lc, Lm, D1, Da, Dc, and Dm -----Output----- Output two space separated integers: - The sum of qualities of the dishes. - The product of qualities of the dishes modulo 109+7. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 107 - 1 ≤ K ≤ N - 0 ≤ a, b, c, d, e, f, r, s, t, m, A[1] ≤ 109+7 - 1 ≤ Lm ≤ N - K + 1 - 1 ≤ Dm ≤ K + 1 - 1 ≤ La, Lc ≤ Lm - 1 ≤ Da, Dc ≤ Dm - 1 ≤ L1 ≤ N - 1 ≤ D1 ≤ K -----Sub tasks----- - Subtask #1: 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1000 (10 points) - Subtask #2: 1 ≤ Q ≤ 104 (20 points) - Subtask #3: original constraints (70 points) -----Example----- Input: 4 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 100 1  1 1 1 3 1 1 1 2 Output: 13 13 -----Explanation----- - The array A comes out to be {1, 3, 13, 83} and the first dish has L = 3 and R = 4. The minimum in this range is 13, thus the sum and product both are 13 and hence the answer. -----Note----- Multiplier for C# and Java have been reduced to 1.5 instead of 2.
