 Given $k$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k$, return $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$)  — the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($3 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$)  — the number of mountains and the length of the door. The second line of the input data set contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 10 ^ 9$, $a_i \neq a_{i + 1}$)  — the heights of mountains. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all the test cases will not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, output two integers $t$ and $l$  — the maximum number of parts that the door can split into, and the left border of the segment of length $k$ that the door should be reset to. -----Example----- Input 5 8 6 1 2 4 1 2 4 1 2 5 3 3 2 3 2 1 10 4 4 3 4 3 2 3 2 1 0 1 15 7 3 7 4 8 2 3 4 5 21 2 3 4 2 1 3 7 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 Output 3 2 2 2 2 1 3 1 2 3 -----Note----- In the first example, you need to select a segment of mountains from $2$ to $7$. In this segment, the indexes $3$ and $6$ are peaks, so the answer is $3$ (only $2$ peaks, so the door will break into $3$ parts). It is not difficult to notice that the mountain segments $[1, 6]$ and $[3, 8]$ are not suitable since they only have a $1$ peak (for the first segment, the $6$ index is not a peak, and for the second segment, the $3$ index is not a peak). In the second example, you need to select a segment of mountains from $2$ to $4$. In this segment, the index $3$ is a peak, so the answer is $2$ (only $1$ peak, so the door will break into $2$ parts). In the third example, you need to select a segment of mountains from $1$ to $4$. In this segment, the index $3$ is a peak, so the answer is $2$ (only $1$ peak, so the door will break into $2$ parts). You can see that on the segments $[2, 5]$, $[4, 7]$ and $[5, 8]$ the number of peaks is also $1$, but these segments have a left border greater than the segment $[1, 4]$, so they are not the correct answer.
