 Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf. 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf. -----Output:----- A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$. - You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$. -----Sample Input----- 5 2 1 4 5 3  -----Sample Output----- 2
