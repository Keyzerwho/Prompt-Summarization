 You are given N positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. Jem is famous of his laziness. He starts working soon. Help him calculate the time it will take until he finish the last problem. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer T represents the number of test cases in the input. Each line in the next T line contains three integers N, B and M represents a test case. -----Output----- For each test case output a single line containing an integer represent how much time Jem will need (in minutes). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N, B, M ≤ 108 -----Example----- Input: 2 9 1 2 123456 123456 123456 Output: 45 131351258112 -----Explanation----- In the first test case, Jem will proceed as below: - Initially, Jem has 9 problems to solve. since it is an odd number, Jem will finish the first (9 + 1) / 2 = 5 problems with speed of 2 minutes/problem. - After that, Jem takes 1 minute break. - Now he has 4 problems to solve, which is an even number, so Jem will solve the next 4 / 2 = 2 problems. his speed after the first break has now became 4 minutes/problem. - Again, he takes a 1 minute break. - he has now 2 problems left so he do one more problem in 8 minutes. - He takes 1 minute break. - he solves the last problem in 16 minutes. So, Jem will need time = 5 × 2 + 1 + 2 × 4 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 16  = 45
