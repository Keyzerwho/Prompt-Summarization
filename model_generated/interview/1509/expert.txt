 You start at the top left disc. Your task is to walk down to the bottom right disc. In each step, you can rotate the current disc by $90$ degrees in the clockwise direction or move to a neighbouring disc. However, you can move to a neighbouring disc only if adjacent sectors of these two discs have the same colour. For example, in the figure above, you can move from the disc at position ($1$, $1$) to either of its neighbours. However, from the disc at position ($1$, $2$) you can only move to the disc at position ($1$
-----Input:----- The first line contains two integers $M$ and $N$. $M$ is the number of rows and $N$ is the number of columns in the given arrangment. This is followed by $M \times N$ lines of input. Lines $2$ to $N+1$, describe the colours on the discs on the first row, Lines $N+2$ to $2 \cdot N+1$ describe the colours on discs in the second row and so on. Each of these lines contain a permutation of the set {R, G, B, Y} giving the colours in the top, right, bottom and left sectors in that order. -----Output:----- A single integer on a single line indicating the minimum number of penalty points required to go from the top left disc to the bottom right disc for the given arrangement of discs. -----Constraints:----- - In $80 \%$ of the input, $1 \leq M,N \leq 60$. - In all the inputs $1 \leq M,N \leq 1000$. -----Sample Input----- 2 4 G Y B R B G R Y G Y B R G R B Y B Y G R G B R Y B R G Y B R G Y -----Sample Output----- 2
