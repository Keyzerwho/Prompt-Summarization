 You are given a sequence of moves that Rakesh made. You need to determine if Rakesh ended up being at his relative's house, at a dangerous place, or at a random place in the city. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows. - The first line of each test case contains two integers M and N. - The second line contains two integers Rx and Ry. - The third line contains the length of Rakesh's move sequence. - The next line contains the move sequence containing letters U, D, R, and L only with no space. -----Output----- For each test case, print "Case i: ", and then the answer, where i is the testcase number, 1-indexed. The answer should be any of the following three strings: -  "REACHED" if Rakesh could reach his relative's house  -  "DANGER" if Rakesh ended up being in a dangerous place  -  "SOMEWHERE" if Rakesh ended up being in somewhere safe place in the city other than his relative's place  Don't print any quotation mark. Check the sample output. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 0 ≤ M, N ≤ 10000 - 0 ≤ Rx ≤  M  - 0 ≤ Ry ≤  N  - 0 ≤ Sum of the lengths of all sequences ≤ 10000 -----Example----- Input: 2 20 20 4 5 13 LLUUUUURRRRRR 10 10 3 4 7 UDUDDRR Output: Case 1: REACHED Case 2: DANGER
