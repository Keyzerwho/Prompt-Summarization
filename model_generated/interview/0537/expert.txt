 You are given n integers. Your task is to find the number of pairs of integers with variation at least K, where K is an integer. 
-----Input format----- The first line contains two positive integers N and K, separated by a space. This is followed by a line containing N integers separated by space giving the values of the sequence. -----Output format----- A single integer in a single line giving the total variation count. -----Test data----- You may assume that all integers in the input are in the range 0 to 10^8 inclusive. Subtask 1 (40 marks) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 4000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^8  Subtask 2 (60 marks) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 65000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^8  -----Sample Input----- 3 1  3 1 3 -----Sample Output----- 2
