 You are given a sequence of numbers. For each number, generate all the possible sequences that are less than or equal to that number. Then output the sum.
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting number of cakes. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $L1$ $L2$ … $LN$ layers of the cake. -----Output:----- For each test case, print a single line containing sum of all the possible numbers which is generated by arranging cake in different sequence. -----Constraints :----- - $1 \leq T  \leq 2*10^5$ - $1 \leq N, L1, L2, L3,…, LN \leq 9$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 3 2 3 5 -----Sample Output:----- 2220 -----Explanation:----- Sum of all possibilities : $235 + 532 + 253 + 352 + 523 + 325 = 2220 $
