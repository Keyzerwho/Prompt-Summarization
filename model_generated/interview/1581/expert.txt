 Find the expected number of moves to reach the first tile with number $S$ written on it. 
-----Input----- - First line contains a single integer $T$ - the total no. of testcases - Each testcase is described by $2$ lines: - $X, Y, S$ - $3$ space-separated natural numbers - $u, v$ - $2$ space-separated natural numbers describing the probability $p$ The value of $p$ is provided as a fraction in its lowest form $u/v$ ($u$ and $v$ are co-prime) -----Output----- - For each testcase, if the expected number of moves can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$ in its lowest form, print $(p * q^{-1})$ modulo $10^9 + 7$, where $q^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $q$ wrt $10^9 + 7$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $2 \leq X, Y \leq 5 * 10^{17}$ - $1 \leq S \leq 10^{18}$ - $1 \leq u < v \leq 10^{9}$ -----Sample Input----- 1 5 3 96 1 3 -----Sample Output----- 48
