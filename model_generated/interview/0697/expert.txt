 Given an array of numbers, form sets of 3 numbers. Each should have numbers in ascending or descending order. Return the number of such sets that can be formed.   Example 1: Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1] Output: 3 Explanation: We can form three sets given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1).  Example 2: Input: rating = [2,1,3
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$. $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases is as follows. - The next line of the input contains 2 space separated integers $N$ and $K$. $N$ denotes the total number of players and $K$ denotes the number of players allowed in a team. - The next line of the input contains $N$ space-separated integers $A1, A2, A3...An$ where $ith$ number denotes power of $ith$ player. Note: power of players can also be negative -----Output:----- - For each test-case print the total power that your selected team have(each test case output must be printed on a new line). -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq N,K \leq 10^5$ - $-10^7 \leq A1, A2, A3...An \leq 10^7$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 -----Sample Output:----- 12
