 Given an array A of positive integers (not necessarily distinct), return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than A that can be made with one swap (A swap exchanges the positions of two numbers A[i] and A[j]).  If it cannot be done, then return the same array.   Note: 1 <= A.length <= 10000 1 <= A[i] <= 10000
