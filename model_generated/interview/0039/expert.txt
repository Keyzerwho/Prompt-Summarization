 You are given a string $s$ of length $n$, where $s_i = \texttt{A}$, if there is a bus station at $i$-th crossroad, and $s_i = \texttt{B}$, if there is a tram station at $i$-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to $s_1$) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to $s_n$). If for two crossroads $i$ and $j$ for all crossroads $i,
-----Input----- Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The first line of each test case consists of three integers $a, b, p$ ($1 \le a, b, p \le 10^5$) — the cost of bus ticket, the cost of tram ticket and the amount of money Petya has. The second line of each test case consists of one string $s$, where $s_i = \texttt{A}$, if there is a bus station at $i$-th crossroad, and $s_i = \texttt{B}$, if there is a tram station at $i$-th crossroad ($2 \le |s| \le 10^5$). It is guaranteed, that the sum of the length of strings $s$ by all test cases in one test doesn't exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case print one number — the minimal index $i$ of a crossroad Petya should go on foot. The rest of the path (i.e. from $i$ to $n$ he should use public transport). -----Example----- Input 5 2 2 1 BB 1 1 1 AB 3 2 8 AABBBBAABB 5 3 4 BBBBB 2 1 1 ABABAB Output 2 1 3 1 6
