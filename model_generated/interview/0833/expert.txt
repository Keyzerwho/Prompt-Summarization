 You are given a 2D grid of size $a \times b$. Each cell in the grid has a value. The value represents the number of points that fall into that cell. Your job is to write a program that will output the number of points that fall into a rectangular portion of the sky. 
-----Input Format----- The first line contains two integers n and m that denote the height and width of the matrix respectively. This is followed by  n lines each containing m integers each. The line following this would contain a single integer t, the number of queries to be run. Each query line consists of 4 integers px, py, qx, qy. The first two integers denote the row and column numbers of the upper left corner of the rectangular region, and the second pair of numbers correspond to the lower right corner. -----Output Format----- For each query output a single line containing the number of stars in that rectangular region. -----Example----- Input: 3 3 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 1 3 3 Output: 10 90 60 30
