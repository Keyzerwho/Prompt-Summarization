 You are given two numbers. Add them together and output their reversed sum. 
-----Input----- The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add. Numbers will be at most 200 characters long. -----Output----- For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output. -----Sample Input----- 3 24 1 4358 754 305 794 -----Sample Output----- 34 1998 1
