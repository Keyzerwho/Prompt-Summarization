 You are given an integer number $N$. Your task is to find the number of operations that Chef needs to convert $N$ to a lucky number. 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N without leading zeros.  -----Output----- For each T test cases print one integer, the minimum number of operations that is needed for changing N to the lucky number. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ N < 10100000 -----Example----- Input: 3 25 46 99 Output: 2 1 2
