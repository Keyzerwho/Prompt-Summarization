 You will be given N and X where N is time at which the number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0. 
-----Input----- The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space separated integers N and X . -----Output----- For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^6+3 -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100000 - 1 ≤ N,X ≤ 10^18 -----Example----- Input: 2 1 2 2 1 Output: 2 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.
