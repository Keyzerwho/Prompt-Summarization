 Given a string S, you transform it into string T by flipping all the 0s in S to 1s, and all the 1s in S to 0s.
-----Input----- The only line of the input contains the binary string,  S .  -----Output----- Output a single line containing one integer, the minimum number of operations that are needed to transform the given string S into the string of equal length consisting only of zeros. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100,000 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1 (30 points): 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 2000 - Subtask #2 (70 points): Original constraints. -----Example----- Input: 01001001 Output: 6 -----Explanation----- For the given sample case, let us look at the way where we achieved minimum number of operations. Operation 1: You flip values in the prefix of length 8 and transform the string into 10110110  Operation 2: You flip values in the prefix of length 7 and transform the string into 01001000  Operation 3: You flip values in the prefix of length 5 and transform the string into 10110000  Operation 4: You flip values in the prefix of length 4 and transform the string into 01000000  Operation 5: You flip values in the prefix of length 2 and transform the string into 10000000  Operation 6: You flip values in the prefix of length 1 and finally, transform the string into 00000000
