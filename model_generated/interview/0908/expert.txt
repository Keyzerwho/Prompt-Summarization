 You have $N$ gold coins. You want to form a triangle with them. What is the maximum possible height of the triangle 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.  The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 109 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1 (48 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 105 - Subtask 2 (52 points) : 1 ≤ N ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input3 3 5 7 Output2 2 3 -----Explanation----- - Test 1: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. - Test 2: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 2 as it requires atleast 6 gold coins. - Test 3: Chef can't form a triangle with height > 3 as it requires atleast 10 gold coins.
