 Motu is given total distance travelled by the ball and ask him to calculate the minimum number of bounces that the ball makes before coming to rest. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, single integers $D$. - Note : Power of $2$ must be a non-negative integer.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer, the minimum number of bounces the ball makes before coming to rest. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $1$ $\leq$ $M$< $10$^18 -----Sample Input:----- 1 13  -----Sample Output:----- 2 -----EXPLANATION:-----
