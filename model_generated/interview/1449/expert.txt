 Given a string of length N, find the number of pairs of integers (L; R) such that 1   L   R   N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains one string, the string S for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces. -----Output----- For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100000 S consists only of the lucky digits 4 and 7. -----Example----- Input: 4 47 74 477 4747477 Output: 2 2 3 23 -----Explanation----- In the first test case balance substrings are S[1, 1] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 47. In the second test case balance substrings are S[2, 2] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 74. Unfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.
