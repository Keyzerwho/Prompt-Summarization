 You are given two numbers M (where M is a prime) and R (where R is a positive integer).  Start the game from M^(R - 1) instead of N (where N is the number of numbers in the starting list).  After the game, output the largest integer K such that M^K divides this number.  Output K modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
-----Input----- First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers M R -----Output----- For each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Raju to Rani modulo 1000000007. -----Constraints----- 1<=T<=1000 2<=M<=109 30 points : 1<=R<=10000 70 points : 1<=R<=109 M is a prime number -----Example----- Input: 1 2 2 Output: 1
