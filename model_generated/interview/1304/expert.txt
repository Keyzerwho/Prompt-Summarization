 Given an array containing $1,2,  , n$, we want to print out all permutations of $1,2,  , n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1,2,  , 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$. However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1,2,  , n$ under the 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$. -----Output:----- The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$. - $1 \leq K \leq 10$. -----Sample input----- 3 2 3 1 2 2 3 1 -----Sample output----- 3 2 1 3 1 2
