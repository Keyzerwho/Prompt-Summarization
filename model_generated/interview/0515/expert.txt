 Your task is to find i such that  (i)/i is maximum among all the 2 i N.
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.  -----Output----- For every test case output i such that φ(i)/i is maximum among all i (2≤i≤N) in a separate line. -----Constrains----- T (1≤T≤500 ) N(2≤N≤10^18) -----Example----- Input: 3 2 3 4 Output: 2 3 3 Explanationφ(2)/2=1/2 φ(3)/3=2/3 φ(4)/4=2/4
