 You are given an array representing the configuration of cells. Return True if Aleksa will win the game, False otherwise.   Example 1: Input: cells = [B,W,B,W,B,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W,
-----Input----- First line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. First and the only line of each test case contains a string S consisting of the characters 'B' and 'W', denoting black and white cells, respectively. -----Output----- For each test case, output "Chef" if chef wins the game for the given configuration. Else print "Aleksa". (quotes for clarity only). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 - S contains exactly 1 white cell. -----Scoring----- -  Subtask 1:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10 : ( 30 pts ) -  Subtask 2:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100 : ( 30 pts ) -  Subtask 3:  1 ≤ T ≤ 10, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000 : ( 40 pts ) -----Example----- Input 3 W BW BWBB Output Chef Aleksa Aleksa ----- Explanation----- -  Test 1 : Aleksa cannot make a move in her first turn as there is no black cell in the given configuration. -  Test 2 : Aleksa can remove 1 black cell lying on the left of white cell in her turn. But then, Chef cannot make a move in his turn as there will be no black cells left. -  Test 3 : Figure out yourself.
