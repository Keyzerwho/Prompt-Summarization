     You are given $n$ rooms. Rooms are numbered from $1$ to $n$. Each room $i$ is a rectangle with dimensions $1 \times 1$. $n$ is the number of rooms, $1 \le i \le n$. Each room is occupied by engineers of one of the two groups. Two adjacent rooms belong to the same group if they don't have the wall between them. Also, we say that relation "belong to the same group" is transitive. In other words we say that if rooms $i$ and $j$ belong to the same group and $k$
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains three integers N, M, W, K and R, where N and M denote size of the floor, W denote number of one-meter-length walls, K denote cost of having one-meter-length wall be noise-resistant and R denote the number of rooms in which floor is partitioned. Next W lines contain four integers each X1, Y1, X2, Y2. This means that cells with coordinates X1, Y1 and X2, Y2 have a wall between them. It's guaranteed that this cells share an edge. Next R lines will contain four space separated integers each X, Y, C1, C2. This should be treated as support cost per month in a room that contain cell X, Y is C1 for first group of engineers and C2 for second group of engineers. It's guaranteed that all of cells among these R cells belong to different rooms. All coordinates are indexed starting from 1. -----Output----- Output a single integer - sum of the rent and support costs per month. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ W ≤ min(2*N*M, 150000) - 1 ≤ X1 ≤ N - 1 ≤ Y1 ≤ M - 1 ≤ X2 ≤ N - 1 ≤ Y2 ≤ M - 1 ≤ K ≤ 10000 - 1 ≤ C1, C2 ≤ 10000 - Limitations on R is described in subtasks section. -----Subtasks----- - Subtask #1 [30 points]: 1 ≤ R ≤ 50 - Subtask #2 [70 points]: 1 ≤ R ≤ 500 -----Example----- Input: 2 4 5 5 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 2 1 3 2 3 1 4 2 4 2 1 2 2 1 1 30 12 1 3 10 15 2 3 11 22 Output: 48 -----Explanation----- Here's the scheme of the floor The correct assignment is the following. - The blue color denotes assignment to the first team. Total cost for renting two rooms for this team is 11 + 10 = 21. - The red color denotes assignment to the second team. Total cost for renting the only room for the team is 12. - There are 3 meters of walls between them, resulting in isolating cost of 15. The grand total is 21 + 12 + 15 = 48
