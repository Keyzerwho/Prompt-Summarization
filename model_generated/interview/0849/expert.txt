 You are given an array of integers. You need to find the length of the largest subarray(contiguous) of the given array with the maximum possible GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). 
-----Input----- First line will contain integer N denoting the size of array. Second line will contain N integers denoting array elements. -----Output----- The answer as specified in the problem statement . -----Constraints----- 1 <= N <= 1000000 1 <= array[i] <=100000000000 -----Example----- Input: 4 2 4 8 3 Output: 1 Explanation GCD of all possible subarrays of the given array are : 2 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 4, 1 , 8 , 1 , 3 Largest GCD possible : 8 Length of the largest subarray with GCD as 8 is 1 Hence answer is 1 .
