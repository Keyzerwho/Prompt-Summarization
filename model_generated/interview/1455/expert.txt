 You are given two integers n and m. Create a matrix numbered from 1 to n m in order of rows.  You have to find a matrix with n rows and m columns in which all numbers from 1 to n m appear exactly once and adjacent numbers in the original matrix are not adjacent in it, or determine that there is no such matrix. Example 1: Input: n = 4, m = 5 Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer N — the number of months Leha has already studied at the university. The second line contains N integers — list A of Leha's grades. The third line contains one integer M — the number of periods Leha is interested in analyzing. Each of the following M lines contain two integers L and R describing each period. -----Output----- For each query, output one integer — the result of the progress analysis for the corresponding period. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 5*104 - 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1 (19 points) 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 200, time limit = 2 sec - Subtask 2 (31 points) 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10 000, time limit = 2 sec - Subtask 3 (26 points) 0 ≤ A[i] ≤ 100, time limit = 5 sec - Subtask 4 (24 points) no additional constraints, , time limit = 5 sec -----Example----- Input:5 1 3 2 4 5 5 1 5 1 4 2 4 3 3 3 5 Output:4 3 2 0 5 Explanation The first query: sorted array looks like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the answer is calculated as (2-1)2 + (3-2)2 + (4-3)2 + (5-4)2 = 4 The second query: sorted array looks like (1, 2, 3, 4) and the answer is calculated as (2-1)2 + (3-2)2 + (4-3)2 = 3 The last query: sorted array looks like (2, 4, 5) and the answer is calculated as (4-2)2 + (5-4)2 = 5
