 You are given a list of $n$ integers and $d$ days. On each day you must increment an element and decrement an adjacent positive element. Find the maximum value possible for element in first postion after $d$ days. 
-----Input:----- - The first line contains integer t(1<=t<100)- amount of zebras in jungle. - Each of following t lines contains two integers a(i) and b(i)(-10^4<=x(i)<=10^4,1<|d(i)|<=2.10^4) - records in owner sheet. - a(i) is the position of i-th zebra and b(i) is distance at which the i-th camel spitted. Positive values of d(i) correspond to spits right, negative values correspond to spit left.No two zebras may stand in the same position. -----Output:----- If there are two zebras , which spitted at each other , output YES, otherwise , output NO. -----Sample Input:----- 2 0 1 1 -1 -----Sample Output:----- YES
