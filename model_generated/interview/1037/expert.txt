 You are given an 2 dimensional array. You can assume the following rules: - no two structures can occupy the same square at the same time - a structure is horizontal or vertical - structures cannot move outside of the board (outs are forbidden) 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string S$S$ with length N$N$ describing the initial board from left to right. An empty square and a square containing a pawn are denoted by the characters '.' and 'P' respectively. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Yes" if Ada wins the game or "No" otherwise (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤500$1 \le T \le 500$ - 2≤N≤128$2 \le N \le 128$ - S$S$ contains only characters '.' and 'P' -----Example Input----- 1 ..P.P -----Example Output----- Yes -----Explanation----- Example case 1: Ada can move the first pawn two squares to the left; the board after this move looks like P...P and now, Suzumo can only move the second pawn. If he moves it one square to the left, Ada will move it two squares to the left on her next move, and if he moves it two squares to the left, Ada will move it one square to the left, so the board after Ada's next move will look like PP... and Suzumo cannot make any move here.
