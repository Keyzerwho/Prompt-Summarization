 You are given N, m and b. You are given an array of strings of only 0's and 1's. Return the maximum number of strings that can be formed by using less than (m+1) 0's and (b+1) 1's in total. Note: The given numbers m and n will both not exceed 100 The size of given string array won't exceed 600. Example 1: Input: Array = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described using a single line containing two integers, N and B. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to this test case. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10,000 - 1 ≤ N, B ≤ 1,000,000,000 -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1 (20 points): 1 ≤ N, B ≤ 1,000 - Subtask 2 (80 points): Original constraints -----Example----- Input: 3 10 2 8 5 6 1 Output: 12 3 9 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. There are 10 units of energy available. Pressing second button takes 2 units of energy. Chef can achieve 12 on the second screen as follows. - Press first button to get scores (1, 0). 9 units of energey is left. - Press first button to get scores (2, 0). 8 units of energy remaining. - Press first button to get scores (3, 0). 7 units of energy remaining. - Press first button to get scores (4, 0). 6 units of energy remaining. - Press second button to get scores (4, 4). 4 units of energy remaining. - Press second button to get scores (4, 8). 2 units of energy remaining. - Press second button to get scores (4, 12). 0 units of energy remaining.
