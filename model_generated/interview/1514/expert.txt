 Raj is a math pro and number theory expert. One day, he met his age-old friend Chef. Chef claimed to be better at number theory than Raj, so Raj gave him some fuzzy problems to solve. In one of those problems, he gave Chef a 3$3$-tuple of non-negative integers (a0,b0,c0)$(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ and told Chef to convert it to another tuple (x,y,z)$(x, y, z)$. Chef may perform
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains six space-separated integers a0$a_0$, b0$b_0$, c0$c_0$, x$x$, y$y$ and z$z$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the minimum cost. -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤105$1 \le T \le 10^5$ - 0≤a0,b0,c0,x,y,z≤1018$0 \le a_0, b_0, c_0, x, y, z \le 10^{18}$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): 0≤a0,b0,c0,x,y,z≤100$0 \le a_0, b_0, c_0, x, y, z \le 100$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 3 2 4 2 -----Example Output----- 0 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: The tuple (1,1,1)$(1, 1, 1)$ can be converted to (2,2,2)$(2, 2, 2)$ using only three Split operations, with cost 0$0$: (1,1,1)→(2,0,2)→(1,1,3)→(2,2,2)$(1, 1, 1) \rightarrow (2, 0, 2) \rightarrow (1, 1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 2, 2)$. Example case 2: We can use one addition operation and one Split operation: (1,2,3)→(1,3,3)→(2,4,2)$(1, 2, 3) \rightarrow (1, 3, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4, 2)$.
