 You are given N boxes (walls) and one target cell (floor). Your task is to move box B to the target position T under the following rules: Player is represented by character 'S' and can move up, down, left, right in the grid if it is a floor (empty cell). Floor is represented by character '.' that means free cell to walk. Wall is represented by character '#' that means obstacle (impossible to walk there).  There is only one box B and one target cell T in the grid. The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box
Example 1: Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],                ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],                ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],                ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],                ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],                ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]] Output: 3 Explanation: We return only the number of times the box is pushed. Example 2: Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],                ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],                ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],                ["#","#","#","#",".","#"],                ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],                ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]] Output: -1 Example 3: Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#"],                ["#","T",".",".","#","#"],                ["#",".","#","B",".","#"],                ["#",".",".",".",".","#"],                ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],                ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]] Output: 5 Explanation:  push the box down, left, left, up and up. Example 4: Input: grid = [["#","#","#","#","#","#","#"],                ["#","S","#",".","B","T","#"],                ["#","#","#","#","#","#","#"]] Output: -1   Constraints: m == grid.length n == grid[i].length 1 <= m <= 20 1 <= n <= 20 grid contains only characters '.', '#',  'S' , 'T', or 'B'. There is only one character 'S', 'B' and 'T' in the grid.
