 You are given groups. Each group contains n people. Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i]. Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.   Example 1: Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3] Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
