 Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays from the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2 numbers. Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in the new array. Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
