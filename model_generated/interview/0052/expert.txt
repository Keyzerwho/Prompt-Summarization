 You are given a list of n integers. You want to split the integers into two lists. You want the largest integer in the first list to differ as little as possible from the smallest integer in the second list. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of tasks. The next n lines contain exactly one integer number a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100 000) — both the difficulty of the initial task and the laziness of the i-th students. -----Output----- Print the minimum total time to finish all tasks modulo 10 007. -----Example----- Input 2 1 3 Output 6 -----Note----- In the first sample, if the students switch their tasks, they will be able to finish them in 3 + 3 = 6 time units.
