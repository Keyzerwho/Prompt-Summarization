 Given some expressions which represent some instructions to be analyzed by Lira's compiler, you should tell the length of the longest prefix of each of these expressions that is valid, or 0 if there's no such a prefix. 
-----Input----- Input will consist of an integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow. Then, T strings follow, each on a single line, representing a possible expression in L++. -----Output----- For each expression you should output the length of the longest prefix that is valid or 0 if there's no such a prefix.  -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 500 - 1 ≤ The length of a single expression ≤ 106 - The total size all the input expressions is no more than 5*106 -----Example----- Input: 3 <<>> >< <>>> Output: 4 0 2
