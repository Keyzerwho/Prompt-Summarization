 Given an integer N, output the number of bases b such that the base-b representation of N starts with a 1. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer N (in base ten). -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the number of bases b, or INFINITY if there are an infinite number of them. -----Constraints----- -----Subtasks-----Subtask #1 (16 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 103 - 0 ≤ N < 103 Subtask #2 (24 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 103 - 0 ≤ N < 106 Subtask #3 (28 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 103 - 0 ≤ N < 1012 Subtask #4 (32 points): - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 0 ≤ N < 1012 -----Example----- Input:4 6 9 11 24 Output:4 7 8 14 -----Explanation----- In the first test case, 6 has a leading digit 1 in bases 2, 4, 5 and 6: 610 = 1102 = 124 = 115 = 106.
