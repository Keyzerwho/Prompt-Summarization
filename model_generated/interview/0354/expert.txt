 # Task  Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.   Example 1: Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3] Output: 34 Explanation: There will be 2 rolls of die, if there are no constraints on the die, there are 6
