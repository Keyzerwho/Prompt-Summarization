 You are given K positive integers, and you need to find the position of the last integer in the original row. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $K$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, print the position of that laddu who is left, in the original row. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq K \leq 10^5$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 1 5 8 -----Sample Output:----- 1 4 8 -----EXPLANATION:----- For 1) Only one laddu which is last so print 1. For 2) Customer 1: [1, 3, 5] New row = [2, 4] Customer 2: [2] Last laddu = 4
