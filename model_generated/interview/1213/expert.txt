 You are given two vectors $X_1$ and $X_2$. Find the distance between them and return the vector $X_3$ such that $X_3$ is the distance between $X_1$ and $X_2$. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, $V_1$ and $V_2$.  -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Chef" if Chef reaches the bottle first, "Kefa" if Kefa reaches the bottle first or "Draw" if Chef and Kefa reach the bottle at the same time (without quotes).  -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $|X_1|, |X_2|, |X_3| \le 10^5$ - $X_1 < X_3 < X_2$ - $1 \le V_1 \le 10^5$ - $1 \le V_2 \le 10^5$ -----Example Input----- 3 1 3 2 1 2 1 5 2 1 2 1 5 3 2 2 -----Example Output----- Kefa Chef Draw -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Chef and Kefa are on the same distance from the bottle, but Kefa has speed $2$, while Chef has speed $1$.
