 The input given are lists of integers. For each test case, print the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $n$ segments. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases in the input. Then the test cases follow, each of them is represented by a separate line containing one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the maximum number of segments that can be turned on in the corresponding testcase. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, print the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $n$ segments of the screen. Note that the answer may not fit in the standard $32$-bit or $64$-bit integral data type. -----Example----- Input 2 3 4 Output 7 11
