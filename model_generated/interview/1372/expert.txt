 You are given two coordinates. You need to find which of them is closer to the office. 
-----Input:----- The first line of the data set for this problem is an integer representing the number of collections of data that follow. Each collection contains 4 integers: the x-coordinate and then the  y-coordinate of truck A followed by the x-coordinate and then the  y-coordinate of truck B. -----Output:----- All letters are upper case. The output is to be formatted exactly like that for the sample output given below. -----Assumptions:----- The x-coordinate is in the range –20 .. 20. The y-coordinate is in the range –20 .. 20. -----Discussion:----- The distance between point #1 with coordinates (x1, y1) and point #2 with coordinates (x2, y2) is: -----Sample Input:----- 4 3 -2 -5 -3 0 6 1 2 -7 8 4 -1 3 3 -2 2 -----Sample Output:----- A IS CLOSER B IS CLOSER B IS CLOSER B IS CLOSER
