 You are given two numbers. Your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above). 
-----Input----- - First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively. - Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills. - Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X. -----Output----- For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 100,000 - 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1,000,000 - 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N - -1,000,000 ≤ X ≤ 1,000,000 - 1 ≤ i, k ≤ N -----Subtasks----- - Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 1,000  - Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints -----Example----- Input: 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 1 2 2 3 4 -1 1 1 2 Output: 3 4 -----Explanation----- The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3. The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5). The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.
