 You are given N positive integers, K integer. You need to find the position of "Uncle Johny" in sorted list . 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.  The first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of songs in Vlad's playlist. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the lenghts of Vlad's songs. The third line contains the only integer K - the position of "Uncle Johny" in the initial playlist. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the position of "Uncle Johny" in the sorted playlist. -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 100 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 3 4 1 3 4 2 2 5 1 2 3 9 4 5 5 1 2 3 9 4  1 Output: 3 4 1 -----Explanation----- In the example test there are T=3 test cases. Test case 1 In the first test case N equals to 4, K equals to 2, A equals to {1, 3, 4, 2}. The answer is 3, because {1, 3, 4, 2} -> {1, 2, 3, 4}. A2 now is on the 3-rd position. Test case 2 In the second test case N equals to 5, K equals to 5, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 4, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A5 now is on the 4-th position. Test case 3 In the third test case N equals to 5, K equals to 1, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 1, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A1 stays on the 1-th position. -----Note----- "Uncle Johny" is a real song performed by The Killers.
