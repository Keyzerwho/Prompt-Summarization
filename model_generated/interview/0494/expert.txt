 Given text, return the largest possible k such that there exists a_1, a_2, ..., a_k such that: Each a_i is a non-empty string; Their concatenation a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_k is equal to text; For all 1 <= i <= k,  a_i = a_{k+1 - i}.   Constraints: text consists only of lowercase English characters. 1 <= text.length <= 1000
