 You are given a set of stations and the total volume of traffic across all the stations is $V$. You need to choose a set of stations that the contractor should bid for so that the total volume of traffic across all the stations in the bid is maximized. 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input contains one integer $N$ indicating the number of railways stations in the network. The stations are numbered $1,2,...,N$. This is followed by $N$ lines of input, lines $2, 3,..., N+1$, indicating the volume of traffic at each station. The volume of traffic at station $i, 1 \leq i \leq N$, is given by a single integer in line $i+1$. The next $N-1$ lines of input, lines $N+2, N+3, ..., 2N$, describe the railway network. Each of these lines contains two integers, denoting a pair of stations that are neighbours. -----Output:----- The output should be a single integer, corresponding to the total volume of traffic across the set of stations in the optimal bid made by the contractor. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.  - Each railway station has at most $50$ neighbours. -----Sample Input----- 6 10 20 25 40 30 30 4 5 1 3 3 4 2 3 6 4 -----Sample Output----- 90
