 You are given numbers $G, T$ and $W$. Find whether an army can be organised in accordance to the rules set by Mance. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $N$, the number of test cases. - Each of the next $N$ lines will contain three integers $G$, $T$ and $W$ - the number of Giant, Thenn and Wildling divisions respectively. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line $Yes$ if a battle formation is possible or $No$ otherwise. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq N \leq 100$ - $1 \leq G,T,W \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 1 2 1 -----Sample Output:----- Yes -----Explanation:----- The first case can be formed as : $ TGWT $. Hence the answer is $ Yes $.
