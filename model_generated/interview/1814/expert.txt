 You are given logs of n functions. Each function has a unique id.  Each log is of the form function_id:start_or_end:timestamp. For example, "0:start:0" means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time 0. "0:end:0" means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0.  Find the total exclusive time of each function.  Sort the output by function id.
