 You are given N cars on a circular track with length N. You are driving car 1 in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend 1 litre of gasoline. When you pass another car, you steal all its gasoline. Once you do not have any gasoline left, you stop. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the total clockwise distance travelled. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N \le 100$ - $0 \le f_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 3 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 4 3 2 1 -----Example Output----- 3 5 15
