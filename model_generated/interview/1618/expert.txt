 Given two strings, one containing polynomial, the other an integer, return a boolean. Your function will receive two arguments: a polynomial as a string, and a point to evaluate the equation as an integer. ## Assumptions: * There will be a coefficient near each `x`, unless the coefficient equals `1` or `-1`. * There will be an exponent near each `x`, unless the exponent equals `0` or `1`. * All exponents will be greater or equal to zero ## Examples: ```python differenatiate(
