 The input is the number of roads n and the output should be the maximum number of regions we can get after making n such roads.
-----Input:----- - The first line consists of the number of test cases $T$.  - Next T lines consists of the number of V shaped roads $n$. -----Output:----- For each test case print a single line consisting of the maximum regions obtained. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $1 \leq n \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 1 2 -----Sample Output:----- 2 7 -----EXPLANATION:----- Test case 1:       For one V shaped road there will be 2 regions Test case 2:       For n=2 the following figure depicts the case of maximum regions:
