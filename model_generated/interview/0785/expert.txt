 You are given two integers $D_1$ and $D_2$. Your task is to find the smallest value of $D$ such that Chef should accept the deal, i.e. his profit from the deal is positive if $D = D_1$, and $D_2$ is the value of $D$ that leads to the maximum possible profit for Chef. If there are multiple values of $D$ that lead to the maximum profit, $D_2$ is the smallest of these values. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $A$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers $D_1$ and $D_2$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100,000$ - $5 \le A \le 10^9$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 4 5 8 9 1000000000 -----Example Output----- 4 3 5 3 5 4 35 30
