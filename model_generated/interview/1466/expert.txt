 Vietnamese and Bengali as well. An $N$-bonacci sequence is an infinite sequence $F_1, F_2, \ldots$ such that for each integer $i > N$, $F_i$ is calculated as $f(F_{i-1}, F_{i-2}, \ldots, F_{i-N})$, where $f$ is some function. A XOR $N$-bonacci sequence is an $N$-bonacci sequence for which $f(F_{i-1}, F
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $Q$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_N$. - The following $Q$ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer $k$. -----Output----- For each query, print a single line containing one integer $S_k$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$ - $0 \le F_i \le 10^9$ for each $i$ such that $1 \le i \le N$ - $1 \le k \le 10^9$ -----Example Input----- 3 4 0 1 2 7 2 5 1000000000 -----Example Output----- 3 1 0 0
