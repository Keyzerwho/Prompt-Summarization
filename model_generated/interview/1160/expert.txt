 A sequence of numbers is zig-zag if first one number increases and then decreases, then second number increases and then decreases and so on. The heights of the trees grow at a rate of $mi$ feet per day. The heights of the trees form zig-zag sequence if the heights of trees first increase and then decrease, then decrease and increase and so on. So for each i, calculate $hi - hi + mi$. If $hi - hi + mi$ is negative, then calculate the time difference $hi - hi + mi$. If $hi - hi + mi$ is positive, then calculate the time
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, denoting the number of trees. The ith of following N lines contains two space separated integers hi and mi, denoting the initial height and the growth speed for ith tree. -----Output----- For each test case, output an integer Q - the amount of the periods of consecutive moments of time, when the trees for a zig-zag sequence. On the following Q lines, output the intervals of time when the trees' heights form a zig-zag sequence. For each intervals, output its' smallest and the largest instants of time. If the range is infinite, output Inf as the right bound. The test cases are designed in such a way that the total output won't exceed 2 MB. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 - Subtask 1 (23 points): 0 ≤ hi, mi ≤ 10 - Subtask 2 (77 points): 0 ≤ hi, mi ≤ 109 - 1 ≤ sum of n over a test cases in a single test file ≤ 5 × 105 -----Example----- Input:3 3 0 1 2 2 0 3 2 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 Output:1 0 1 2 0 0 2 Inf 0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. In the first case 0 2 0 is already a zig-zag sequence, but on the 2nd second it will become 2 6 6 and will never turn back into zig-zag
