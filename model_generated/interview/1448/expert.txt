 Given $a$, $d$ and $inc$, can you guess the number of problems Kshitij will solve on $nth $ day.
-----Input:----- - First line  contains $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input,five integers $a, d, k, n, inc$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line number of questions solved on $nth$ day. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 15$ - $1 \leq a \leq 99$ - $1 \leq d \leq 100$ - $1 \leq n \leq 10000$ - $1 \leq k \leq n$ - $0 \leq inc \leq 99$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 1 4 3 8 2 -----Sample Output:----- 43 -----EXPLANATION:----- The number of questions solved in first 8 days is : $1$ $5$ $9$ $15$ $21$ $27$ $35$ $43$ . On first day he solved 1 problem . Here $d$ is  4 for first 3 days. Then after 3 days $d$ increases by 2 (that is 6).
