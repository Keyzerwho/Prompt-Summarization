 You are given N people to be split into two groups such that given dislikes[i] = [a, b], a and b should be in different groups. You need to find minimum number of steps people will take so as to sit in the dinner party. Example 1: Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]] Output: 9 Example 2: Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
-----Input----- First line of input contain an integer T — the number of test cases. T tests follow. First line of each test case contain the integer N, and the next line contains N integers — A[1], A[2], ... , A[N]. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line with the answer — the minimal number of steps required. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 - 0 ≤ A[i] < i -----Example----- Input: 3 1 0 3 0 0 0 5 0 1 2 1 4 Output: 0 0 3 -----Explanation----- Example case 3. - First three persons don't need any steps to sit. The line after the arrangement of these persons will look like [1, 2, 3].   - When person #4 comes in, he wants to sit to the right of person 1, so we need to either move the first person to the left, or the second and third persons to the right. The first case is clearly better. Now the line will look like [1, 4, 2, 3].   - When person #5 arrives, he will need to move 2 persons in either case. The final arrangement will be [1, 4, 5, 2, 3].  So total number of steps people moved during the entire process is 1 + 2 = 3. So the answer is 3.
