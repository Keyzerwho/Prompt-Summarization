 Your task is to find the maximum number of coins DD can take by making the ideal choice.
-----Input:----- - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.  - First-line contains $N$ and $K$. - Second-line contains $N$ numbers $A_1, A_2,...,A_N$,   -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line, the maximum money that can be collected by DD. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$ - $5 \leq N \leq 10^5$ - $1 \leq K < N$ - $1 \leq A_i \leq 10^5$ Sum of $N$ over all test cases is less than $10^6$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 5 3 8 6 9 4 10 -----Sample Output:----- 24 -----EXPLANATION:----- The ideal choice would be to take the last bag with $10$ coins and the first $2$ bags with $8$ and $6$ coins.
