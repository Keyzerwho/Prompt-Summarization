 You are given $N$ and $K$. You need to find the number of candies you need to distribute. Note: $K$ is non-negative integer. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - The only line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.  -----Output:----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the number of candies you need. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq  10^6$ - $2 \leq  N \leq  10^3$ - $0 \leq  K \leq 10^4$  -----Sample Input:----- 1  2 1 -----Sample Output:----- 3 -----EXPLANATION:----- The minimum number of candies required is $3$. One kid needs to have $1$ candy and the other needs to have $2$ candy to have a difference of $1$ candy between them.
