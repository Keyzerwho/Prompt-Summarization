 You are given an array friends. Calculate and return the most popular friend in each group. 
Example: - Suppose A is friend of B. - B has two friends C and D. - E is a friend of D. Now, the distance between A and B is 1, A and C is 2, C and E is 3.  So, one of our smart cooks took the responsibility of identifying the most popular friend in each group and others will go to persuade them for posting.  This cheeky fellow knows that he can release his burden by giving this task as a long contest problem. Now, he is asking you to write a program to identify the most popular friend among all the friends in each group. Also, our smart cook wants to know the average distance of everyone from the most popular friend. -----Input----- Friends in a group are labelled with numbers to hide their Facebook identity. The first line of input contains the number of groups in which users are divided. First line of each group contains the number of friends that belong to that group. ith line of each group contains the space separated friend list of 'i'. You are assured that each friend's profile can be accessed by the profile of every other friend by following some sequence of profile visits. -----Output----- Your output contains the most popular friend name label along with the average distance (space separated) from all other friends (including himself / herself) in six digits of precision. There might be multiple most popular friend, in that case output the friend labelled with least number.  -----Note:----- Each person in a group have atleast one friend and he/she cannot be in his/her own friend list.  Number of friends in a group cannot be more than 100. There are atmost 100 groups. -----Example----- Input: 1 6 3 5 1 4 3 5 6 2 4 6 4 5 Output: 4 1.166667
