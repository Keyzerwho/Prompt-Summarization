 You are given a tree with N vertices, whose i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i. Vertex i has an integer a_i written on it. For every integer k from 1 through N, solve the following problem:  - We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence. Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A of length L is the subsequence A_{i_1}
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N a_1 a_2 ... a_N u_1 v_1 u_2 v_2 : u_{N-1} v_{N-1} -----Output----- Print N lines. The k-th line, print the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence obtained from the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k. -----Sample Input----- 10 1 2 5 3 4 6 7 3 2 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 3 6 6 7 1 8 8 9 9 10 -----Sample Output----- 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 2 2 3 For example, the sequence A obtained from the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex 5 is 1,2,5,3,4. Its longest increasing subsequence is A_1, A_2, A_4, A_5, with the length of 4.
