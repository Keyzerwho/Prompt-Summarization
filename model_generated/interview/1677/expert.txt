 You are given two lists of N integers, a1, a2, ..., aN and b1, b2, ... bN. For any pair (i, j) with i, j   {1, 2, ..., N} we define the segment from i to j, written as [i, j], to be i, i + 1, ..., j if i   j and i, i + 1, ..., N, 1, 2, ...,j
-----Input format----- - The first line contains a single positive integer N. - This is followed by a line containing N integers giving the values of the ais and this is followed by a line containing N integers giving the values of the bis. -----Output format----- A single integer in a single line giving the maximum possible special segment sum. Note: The final value may not fit in a 32 bit integer. Use variables of an appropriate type to store and manipulate this value (long long in C/C++, long in Java). -----Test Data----- You may assume that -109 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 109. Subtask 1 (10 Marks) 1 ≤ N ≤ 3000. Subtask 2 (20 Marks) 1 ≤ N ≤ 106 and ai = bi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Subtask 3 (30 Marks) 3 ≤ N ≤106. Further a1 = b1 = aN = bN = -109 and for each 1 < k < N we have -999 ≤ ak, bk ≤ 999. Subtask 4 (40 Marks) 1 ≤ N ≤ 106. -----Example----- Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above: -----Sample input----- 5 2 3 2 3 1 3 4 4 6 3 -----Sample output----- 18 Note: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format. Please remove all diagnostic print statements before making your final submission. A program with extraneous output will be treated as incorrect!
