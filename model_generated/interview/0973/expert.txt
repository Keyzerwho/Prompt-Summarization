 You are given $N$ integers and an integer $K$. Each element in the array can be incremented by $K$ or decremented by $K$ at most once. (As there are 3 options for every element). Out of these combinations, you have to select a combination, in which the absolute difference between the largest and the smallest element is maximum. Print the maximum absolute difference. 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a two lines of input - First line contains two integers $N, K$.  - Second line contains $N$ space separated integers. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output the maximum absolute difference that can be achieved on a new line. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $2 \leq N \leq 1000$ - $1 \leq K , arr[i]  \leq 10000$ $NOTE$:  Large  input files, Use of fastio is recommended. -----Sample Input:----- 2 4 3 4 2 5 1 3 5 2 5 3 -----Sample Output:----- 10 13
