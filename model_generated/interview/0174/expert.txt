 You are given a string representing the file system in the above format. The string is the input. Return the length of the longest absolute path to file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0. Time complexity: O(n) where n is the size of the input string. Notice that a/aa/aaa/file1.txt is not the longest file path, if there is another path aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/sth.png.
