 You are given n integers. Reduce the height of all the blocks other than the temple by 1 unit. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer n. The next line contains n integers, where the i-th integer denotes hi -----Output----- For each test case, output a new line with an integer corresponding to the answer of that testcase. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 2 ≤ n ≤ 105 - 1 ≤ hi ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input 3 3 1 2 1 4 1 1 2 1 5 1 2 6 2 1 Output 0 1 3 -----Explanation----- Example 1. The entire mountain range is already a temple. So, there is no need to make any operation. Example 2. If you reduce the height of the first block to 0. You get 0 1 2 1. The blocks 1, 2, 1 form a temple. So, the answer is 1. Example 3. One possible temple can be 1 2 3 2 1. It requires 3 operations to build. This is the minimum amount you have to spend in order to build a temple.
