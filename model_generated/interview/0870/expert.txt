 You are given a binary string $S$ with length $N$. We want to make this string pure by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from it. What is the minimum number of characters we have to delete  
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ with length $N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum number of characters we have to delete from $S$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 40$ - $1 \le N \le 1,000$ - $S$ contains only characters '0' and '1' -----Example Input----- 4 010111101 1011100001011101 0110 111111 -----Example Output----- 2 3 0 0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: We can delete the first and third character of our string. There is no way to make the string pure by deleting only one character. Example case 3: The given string is already pure, so the answer is zero.
