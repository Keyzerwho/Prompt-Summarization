 You are given Chef's company's plan to make ATM PINs for its users, so that if a user tries to withdraw their money, the Crime Investigation Department (CID) are immediately informed and stop the robbery.  However, even though this was implemented by Chef, some people could still continue to get robbed. The reason is that CID is only informed if the reverse of a PIN is different from that PIN (so that there wouldn't be false reports of robberies). You know that a PIN consists of $N$ decimal digits. Find the probability that Reziba could get robbed. Specifically, it can be proven that this probability can be written as a fraction $P
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the length of each PIN.  -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing two space-separated integers — the numerator $P$ and denominator $Q$ of the probability. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 100$ - $1 \le N \le 10^5$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (10 points): $N \le 18$ Subtask #2 (20 points): $N \le 36$ Subtask #3 (70 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 1 -----Example Output----- 1 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: A PIN containing only one number would fail to inform the CID, since when it's input in reverse, the ATM detects the same PIN as the correct one. Therefore, Reziba can always get robbed — the probability is $1 = 1/1$.
