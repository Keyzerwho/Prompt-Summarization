 Chef has a circular sequence $A$ of $N$ non-negative integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ where $A_i$ and $A_{i+1}$ are considered adjacent, and elements $A_1$ and $A_N$ are considered adjacent. An operation on position $p$ in array $A$ is defined as replacing $A_p$ by the bitwise OR of elements adjacent to $A_p$. Formally, an operation is defined as: - If $p = 1$,
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$ denoting the number of elements, and the required bitwise OR after operations. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. -----Output:----- For each test case, if no valid sequence of operations exist, print -1. Otherwise, print $N$ space-separated integers in which $i$-th integer denote the position chosen in the $i$-th operation. If there are multiple valid sequences of operations, you may print any valid sequence. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $3 \le N \le 2*10^5$ - $0 \le A_i, K \le 10^9$ - It's guaranteed that the total length of the arrays in one test file doesn't exceed $10^6$ -----Sample Input:----- 5 3 6 2 1 6 3 6 2 1 5 3 7 2 4 6 3 7 1 2 4 3 7 1 2 6 -----Sample Output:----- 2 1 3 -1 -1 -1 2 3 1 -----Explanation:----- In the first test case, initially, the sequence is {2, 1, 6}.  - Chef applies the operation on the $2^{nd}$ index, so the sequence converts to {2, 6, 6}. - Next, Chef applies the operation on the $1^{st}$ index, so the sequence converts to {6, 6, 6}. - Next, Chef applies the operation on the $3^{rd}$ index, and this time sequence does not change. The final sequence is {6, 6, 6}, and bitwise OR of this sequence is $6$ that is equal to given $K$.
