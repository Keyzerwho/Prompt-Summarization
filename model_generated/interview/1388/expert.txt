 You are given Chef's total income, $N$ rupees. Find his net income. The net income is calculated by subtracting the total tax (also called tax reduction) from the total income.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” Chef's net income. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^3$ - $0 \le N \le 10^7$ - $N$ is a multiple of $100$ -----Example Input----- 2 600000 250000 -----Example Output----- 577500 250000 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: We know that the total income is Rs. $6$ lakh ($1$ lakh rupees = $10^5$ rupees). The total tax for each slab is calculated as follows: - Up to $2.5$ lakh, the tax is Rs. $0$, since the tax rate is $0$ percent. - From above Rs. $2.5$ lakh to Rs. $5$ lakh, the tax rate is $5$ percent. Therefore, this tax is $0.05 \cdot (500,000-250,000)$, which is Rs. $12,500$. - From above Rs. $5$ lakh to Rs. $6$ lakh, the tax rate is $10$ percent. Therefore, this tax is $0.10 \cdot (600,000-500,000)$, which is Rs. $10,000$. - Summing them up, we get that the total tax on Chef's whole income is Rs. $22,500$. Since the net income is the total income minus the tax reduction, it is Rs. $600,000$ minus Rs. $22,500$, which is Rs. $577,500$. Example case 2: For income up to Rs. $2.5$ lakh, we have no tax, so the net income is the same as the total income: Rs. $2.5$ lakh.
