 Tid Gusto posted a new dish and named it 'Tid Rice'. He posted the recipe in his newly designed blog for community voting, where a user can plus (+) or minus (-) the recipe. The final score is just the sum of all votes, where (+) and (-) are treated as +1 and -1 respectively. But, being just a chef ( and not a codechef ) he forgot to take care of multiple votes by the same user. A user might have voted multiple times and Tid is worried that the final score shown is not the correct one. Luckily
-----Input----- First line contains T ( number of testcases, around 20 ). T cases follow. Each test case starts with N ( total number of votes, 1 <= N <= 100 ). Each of the next N lines is of the form "userid vote" ( quotes for clarity only ), where userid is a non-empty string of lower-case alphabets ( 'a' - 'z' ) not more than 20 in length and vote is either a + or - . See the sample cases below, for more clarity. -----Output----- For each test case, output the correct final score in a new line -----Example----- Input: 3 4 tilak + tilak + tilak - tilak + 3 ratna + shashi - ratna - 3 bhavani - bhavani + bhavani - Output: 1 -2 -1 Explanation Case 1 : Initially score = 0. Updation of scores in the order of user tilak's votes is as follows, ( + ): +1 is added to the final score. This is the 1st vote by this user, so no previous vote to nullify. score = 1 ( + ):  0 should be added ( -1 to nullify previous (+) vote, +1 to count the current (+) vote ). score = 1 ( - ) : -2 should be added ( -1 to nullify previous (+) vote, -1 to count the current (-) vote ). score = -1 ( + ): +2 should be added ( +1 to nullify previous (-) vote, +1 to count the current (+) vote ). score = 1
