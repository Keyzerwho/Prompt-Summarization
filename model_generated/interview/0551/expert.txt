 Your task is to write a function `equalsequences` that accepts a string S and returns two sequences of indices (a1, a2, ..., ak-1, ak) and (b1, b2, ..., bk-1, bk) such that: - 1  ai, bi   |S| - ai < ai+1 for all valid i - bi < bi+1 for all valid i - Sai = Sbi for all valid i - there exist at least one i such that ai
-----Input section----- The first line contains T, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contain one string S each. Input will only consist of lowercase english characters -----Output section----- For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) as the solution to the problem. -----Input constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 1 ≤ length of S ≤ 100 -----Sample Input----- 4 likecs venivedivici bhuvan codechef -----Sample Output----- no yes no yes -----Explanation----- In test case 2, one of the possible equal subsequence is "vi" and "vi". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 7}, assuming 0-based indexing). In test case 4, one of the possible equal subsequence is "ce" and "ce". (one at position {0, 3} and other at {4, 6}, assuming 0-based indexing).
