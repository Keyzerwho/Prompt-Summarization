 Mr. Wilson was planning to record his new Progressive Rock music album called "Digits. Cannot. Separate". Xenny and PowerShell, popular pseudo-number-theoreticists from the Land of Lazarus were called by him to devise a strategy to ensure the success of this new album. Xenny and Powershell took their Piano Lessons and arrived at the Studio in different Trains. Mr. Wilson, creative as usual, had created one single, long music track S. The track consisted of N musical notes. The beauty of each musical note was represented by a decimal digit from 0 to 9. Mr. Wilson told them that he wanted to create multiple musical tracks out of this long
-----Input----- The first line of input consists of a single integer T - the number of testcases. Each test case is of the following format: First line contains a single integer N - the length of the long musical track. Second line contains the string of digits S. Third line contains 3 space-separated integers - M, X and Y - the maximum number of digits in a number, the minimum number of separators to be used and the maximum number of separators to be used. -----Output----- For each testcase, output a single integer on a new line - the maximum GCD possible after placing the separators. -----Constraints----- Subtask 1: 20 points - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 18 - 1 ≤ M ≤ 2 - 1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ (N - 1) Subtask 2: 80 points - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 300 - 1 ≤ M ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ (N - 1) For both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2: - 1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ (N - 1) - M*(Y+1) ≥ N - S may contain leading 0s. -----Example-----Input: 2 3 474 2 1 1 34 6311861109697810998905373107116111 10 4 25 Output: 2 1 -----Explanation----- Test case 1.  Since only 1 separator can be placed, we can only have 2 possibilities: a. 4 | 74 The GCD in this case is 2. b. 47 | 4 The GCD in this case is 1. Hence, the maximum GCD is 2. Test case 2. One of the optimal partitions is: 63|118|61|109|69|78|109|98|90|53|73|107|116|111 Bonus: Decode the above partition to unlock a hidden treasure.
