 The chef has recipes in book. The chef has to read each recipe exactly once. Given $N$, determine the minimum number of days chef has to read the entire book and the pages chef has to read on each of these days. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. -----Output----- For each test case: - First, print a line containing a single integer $D$ ― the minimum number of days required to read the book. Let's number these days $1$ through $D$. - Then, print $D$ lines describing the pages Chef should read. For each valid $i$, the $i$-th of these lines should contain an integer $C_i$ followed by a space and $C_i$ space-separated integers ― the numbers of pages Chef should read on the $i$-th day. If there are multiple solutions with the minimum number of days, you may print any one. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10$ - $1 \le N \le 10^6$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): $N \le 100$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 1 5 -----Example Output----- 2 3 1 2 5 2 3 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: - On the first day, Chef should read three pages: $1$, $2$ and $5$. - On the second day, Chef should read the remaining two pages: $3$ and $4$. There are other valid solutions as well.
