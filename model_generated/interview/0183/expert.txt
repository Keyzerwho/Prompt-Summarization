 Given two arrays nums1 and nums2. Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length. 
Example 1: Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6] Output: 18 Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2. Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18. Example 2: Input: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7] Output: 21 Explanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2. Their dot product is (3*7) = 21. Example 3: Input: nums1 = [-1,-1], nums2 = [1,1] Output: -1 Explanation: Take subsequence [-1] from nums1 and subsequence [1] from nums2. Their dot product is -1. Â  Constraints: 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500 -1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
