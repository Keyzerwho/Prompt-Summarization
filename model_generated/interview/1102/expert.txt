 Input: $S$
Output: 
-----Input:----- -  The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. -  Each test case consists of a string $S$. -----Output:----- - For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007 -----Constraints----- -  1 <= $T$ <= 10 -  1 <= $|S|$ <= 105 -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (10 points): - 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10 Subtask #2 (90 points): - Original Constraints -----Sample Input:----- 2 5 72   -----Sample Output:----- 3 12   -----EXPLANATION:----- -  Example Case 1: On the key 5, we have the character set JKL. Hence the possible strings are J,K,L. Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.   -  Example Case 2: On key 7, we have the character set PQRS. On key 2, we have the character set ABC. Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC. Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.
