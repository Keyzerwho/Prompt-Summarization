 You are given a list of numbers. You need to find the count of digit 4 in the numbers. 
-----Input----- First line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed.  1<=T<=1000  1<=N<=1000000000 (10^9)  -----Output----- If it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1. Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits. -----Example----- Input: 5 7 4 11 1 15 Output: 7 0 7 -1 7 Explanation For the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is 444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7.
