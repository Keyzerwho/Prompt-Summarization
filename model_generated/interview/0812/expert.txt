 You are given a list of $n$ integers and the distance between two villages. Find the least amount of grass that villagers need to buy to feed laddus to dinosaurs. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines.  First line contains a single integer denoting n: number of villages.  Second line contains n space separated integers denoting the array D. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing the integer corresponding to answer of the problem. -----Constraints----- -  1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5  -  1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5  -  -10^4 ≤ D[i] ≤ 10^4  -  Sum of n over all the test cases will be ≤ 10^6  -  It is guaranteed that sum of D[i] is zero for a single test case which ensures that there are equal number of villagers and dinosaurs.  -----Example----- Input: 3 2 5 -5 2 -5 5 3 1 2 -3 Output: 5 5 4 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Each villager in village 1, need to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur in 2nd village. Example case 2. Each villager in village 2, need to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur 1st village. Example case 3. Each villager in village 1, need to walk 2 km to reach to the dinosaur in 3rd village whereas Each villager in village 2,  need to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur in 3rd village.
