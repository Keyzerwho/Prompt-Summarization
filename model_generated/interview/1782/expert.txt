  You have to implement a simple lexer type. It should take in an input string through the constructor (or the parameter, for Javascript), and break it up into typed-tokens (in python, C# and Java, you'll have to manage `null/None` input too, resulting in the same behavior than an empty string). You'll need to implement the necessary methods (aaccording to your language) to make the Simplexer object behave like an iterator, Meaning that it returns a token (assuming one is available) object each time it a `next` (`Current` field
