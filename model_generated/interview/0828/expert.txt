 You are given an array of size N. Each element in the array is either 0 or 1. Each element in the array represents whether Chef has paid the maintenance fees in the i-th month or not. Return the total due Chef has to pay to the apartment.   
-----Input----- First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test cases contains an integer N denoting the number of months for which you have to calculate the total amount of money that Chef has to pay at the end of the n month to clear all of his dues. Next line of each test case contains N space separated integers (each of them can be either 0 or 1) denoting whether Chef paid the 1000Rs fees in the corresponding month or not. If the corresponding integer is 1, it means that Chef paid the maintenance fees for that month, whereas 0 will mean that Chef did not pay the maintenance fees that month. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer denoting the total amount including fine that Chef has to pay. -----Constraints-----Constraints - 1 ≤ T ≤ 25 - 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1 -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (30 points) - 1 ≤ N ≤ 103 Subtask #2 (70 points) - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105 -----Example----- Input 4 2 1 1 2 0 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 1 Output 0 2200 2300 1200 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Chef paid maintenance fees for both the months. So, he does not have any dues left. Example case 2. Chef did not pay the maintenance fees for any of the months. For the first month, he has to pay 1000Rs, and 100Rs fine as a late payment. For second month payments, he just have to pay 1100Rs. So, in total he has a due of 1100 + 1100 = 2200 Rs. Example case 3. In the first month, Chef did not pay his maintenance fees. He paid the maintenance of first in the second month. So, he paid a fine of 100Rs for first month. For second and third month, Chef did not pay the maintenance fees. So, he has to pay 1000Rs + 100Rs (of fine) for second month and only 1000Rs + 100Rs (of fine) for third month. In total, Chef has got to pay 100 + 1100 + 1100 = 2300 Rs.  Example case 4. In the first month, Chef did not pay his maintenance fees. He paid the maintenance of first in the second month. So, he paid a fine of 100Rs for first month. For second month, Chef did not pay the maintenance fees. So, he has to pay 1000Rs + 100Rs (of fine) for second month. In total, Chef has got to pay 100 + 1100 = 1200 Rs.
