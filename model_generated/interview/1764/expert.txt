 You are given integers `num_eggs` and `num_drops` and are allowed to make a maximum of `num_drops` drops. If an egg does not break when dropped, it may be reused. You may assume that it is feasible to determine the floor with the given number of eggs and drops. Example 1:  You are given 1 egg and 10 drops. You start by dropping the egg from the first floor (floor numbering starts at 1). If it breaks, the answer is 1. If it does not break, you drop it from the second floor. If it breaks, the answer is 2
