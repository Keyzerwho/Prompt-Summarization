 You are given an equilateral triangle  ABC with the side BC being the base. Each side of the triangle is of length L. There are L-1 additional points on each of the sides dividing the sides into equal parts of unit lengths. Points on the sides of the triangle are called major points. Joining these points with lines parallel to the sides of  ABC will produce some more equilateral triangles. The intersection points of these parallel lines are called minor points.  Look at the picture below. It contains  - Major points: A, B, C, P1, P2, Q1, Q3, R1, R4, S1, S2
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows. - Each test case has one line containing two space-separated integers: L and K. -----Output----- For each testcase, print "Case i: ", and then the answer, where i is the testcase number, 1-indexed. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 500 -  1 ≤ L, K ≤ 5000 -----Example----- Input: 2 4 3 4 4 Output: Case 1: 3 Case 2: 1 -----Explanation----- The figure presented in the problem description is a triangle with side length 4. In testcase 1, the valid triangles are ΔAR1R4, ΔP1BS3, ΔP2S1C In testcase 2, the only valid triangle is ΔABC
