 Chef can only grow tomatoes in rectangular patches consisting only of cells which belong to him. Also, if he uses a cell, he must use it entirely. He cannot use only a portion of it.  Help Chef find the number of unique patches of rectangular land that he can grow tomatoes in! Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 1000000007$1000000007$.
-----Input:----- - The first line of the input contains T$T$, the number of test cases. - The next T$T$ lines of input contains one integer N$N$. -----Output:----- For each testcase, output the number of ways modulo 1000000007$1000000007$. -----Constraints----- - 1≤T≤5$1 \leq T \leq 5$ - 1≤N≤1010$1 \leq N \leq 10^{10}$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 4 10000000000 -----Sample Output:----- 23 227374950
