 Chef wants to make ingredients with all reachable values of tastiness and he would like to know the number of unreachable values. Help him solve this problem. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,007 ($10^9+7$). Note that there is an infinite number of reachable values of tastiness, but it can be proven that the number of unreachable values is always finite for $N \ge 2$.
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of unreachable values of tastiness, modulo $1,000,000,007$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10^5$ - $2 \le N \le 10^{18}$ - $1 \le K \le 10^{18}$ -----Subtasks----- Subtask #1 (20 points): $N = 2$ Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints -----Example Input----- 2 2 1 3 3 -----Example Output----- 0 2 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: It is possible to obtain ingredients with all values of tastiness. Example case 2: Ingredients with tastiness $1$ and $2$ cannot be made.
