 You are given $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. Find $x_i$ such that $x_i+x_j=x_k$ for all $i,j,k$. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains a single integer $\text{T}$ - the number of test cases.  For each test case, The first line contains a single integer $\text{N}$, the number of bottles.  The second line contains N space-separated integers, the concentrations.  -----Output----- For each test case, print one line containing the lowest final concentration. The output will be accepted if the absolute error is $\leq 10^{-6}$. -----Constraints----- $1 \leq \text{T} \leq 10$ $2 \leq \text{N} \leq 10^4$ $0 \leq \mathbf{a_i} \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input----- 2 2 9 3 3 3 2 9 -----Sample Output----- 6.00000000 4.00000000 -----Explanation----- In test 1, Tanish mixes flasks 1 and 2. In test 2, he first mixes flasks 1 and 3 to get a flask of concentration 6 and then mixes this flask with flask 2 to get a flask of poison concentration 4.     -----Note----- The concentration is given in the unit ppb i.e. parts per billion. 1 gram poison in $10^9$ ml solution is 1 ppb. Concentration in ppb = (Number of grams of poison / Volume of solution in ml) x $10^9$
