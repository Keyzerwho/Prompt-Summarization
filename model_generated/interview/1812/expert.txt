 Implement the class MajorityChecker. It has the following API: MajorityChecker(int[] arr) constructs an instance of MajorityChecker with the given array arr; int query(int left, int right, int threshold) has arguments such that:          0 <= left <= right < arr.length representing a subarray of arr; 2 * threshold > right - left + 1, ie. the threshold is always a strict majority of the length of the subarray Each query(...) returns the element in arr[left], arr[left+1]
