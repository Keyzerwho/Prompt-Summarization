 You are given a tree, you have to find its good subtree with maximum possible size. Recall that a subtree is a connected subgraph of a tree. Note that you have to answer $q$ independent queries. 
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 15 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of the queries.  The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree. Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) denoting an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each query print one integer — the maximum size of a good subtree of the given tree. -----Example----- Input 1 10 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 6 3 7 3 8 4 9 4 10 Output 8 -----Note----- In the first query there is a good subtree of size $8$. The vertices belonging to this subtree are ${9, 4, 10, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3}$.
