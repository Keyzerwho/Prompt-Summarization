 Your task is simple. Write a function ```solve``` that takes as parameters: 1. A string ```input``` consisting of sequence of characters ```S'`, ```N'`, ```W'`, ```E'```, 2. A string ```output``` consisting of sequence of characters ```S`, ```N`, ```W`, ```E```, 3. A positive integer ```N``` (maximum 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow. Each set is given by one nonempty string of the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the string does not exceed $10^5$ characters. The sum of the lengths of $t$ given lines over all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, print the desired path time in seconds. -----Example----- Input 5 NNN NS WWEN WWEE NWNWS Output 15 6 16 12 25
