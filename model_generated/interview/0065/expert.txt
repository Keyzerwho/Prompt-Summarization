 You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are $n$ bosses in this tower, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The type of the $i$-th boss is $a_i$. If the $i$-th boss is easy then its type is $a_i = 0$, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is $a_i = 1$. During one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of bosses. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 1$), where $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th boss. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$ ($\sum n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). -----Output----- For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all $n$ bosses in the given order. -----Example----- Input 6 8 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 0 7 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 Output 2 2 2 2 1 0
