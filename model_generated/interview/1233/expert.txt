 You are given a string. Find a value $length$ such that there exist pair of indices $(i,j)$ which denotes $S[i...j]$ is a  good  group where $i\geq1$ and $j\leq S.length$ and $i\leq j$ and $(j-i+1)=length$ and there exist no other pair $(i ,j )$ such that $(j -i +1)>length$ and $S[i'...j']$ is a "good
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - $i^{th}$ testcase consist of a single line of input, a string $S$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, output in a single line maximum possible size of a "good" group. -----Constraints----- $\textbf{Subtask 1} (20 points)$ - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $S.length \leq 10^{3}$ $\textbf{Subtask 2} (80 points)$ - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $S.length \leq 10^{5}$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 123343 -----Sample Output:----- 3 -----EXPLANATION:----- 1$\textbf{$\underline{2 3 3}$}$43 Underlined group is a “good” group because the second player(number 2 on T-Shirt) is the only player who is left unmatched and third and fourth player can form a pair, no other group has length greater than 3 that are “good”. However note that we have other “good” group also 12$\textbf{$\underline{334}$}$3 but length is 3 which is same as our answer. -----Sample Input:----- 1 95665 -----Sample Output:----- 5 -----EXPLANATION:----- $\textbf{$\underline{95665}$}$ is “good” group because first player is the only player who is left unmatched second and fifth player can form pair and third and fourth player also form pair. -----Sample Input:----- 2 2323 1234567 -----Sample Output:----- 4 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- For first test case $\textbf{$\underline{2323}$}$ is a “good” group because there are no players who are left unmatched first and third player form pair and second and fourth player form pair. For second test Only length one "good" group is possible.
