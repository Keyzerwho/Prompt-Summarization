 You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that: every number is used atleast once a number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been used Return the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7. Example 1: Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1 Output: 6 Explanation: There are 6 possible combinations. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow. Description of each test case contains 2 lines. The first of these lines contain a single integer N, the number of cars. The second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the maximum speed of the cars in the order they entered the long straight segment. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the segment. -----Example----- Input: 3 1 10 3 8 3 6 5 4 5 1 2 3 Output: 1 2 2 -----Constraints----- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000 All speeds are distinct positive integers that fit in a 32 bit signed integer. Each input file will not be larger than 4 MB (4,000,000,000 bytes) in size. WARNING! The input files are very large. Use faster I/O.
