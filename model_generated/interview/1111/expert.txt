 Kim can obviously break through the door.  He wants to find the number of different pairs of buttons he can pick in order to break through the door. 
-----Input:----- - The first line contains a single integer $T$, representing the number of testcases. $2T$ lines follow, 2 for each testcase. - For each testcase, the first line contains a single integer $N$, the number of buttons. - The second line of each testcase contains $N$ space-separated integers, $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$, representing the numbers written on each button. -----Output:----- Print a single number, $K$, representing the number of pairs of buttons in $A$ which have an odd sum. -----Subtasks----- For all subtasks,  $1 \leq T \leq 10$, $1 \leq N \leq 100000$, and $1 \leq A_i \leq 100000$ for all $A_i$. Subtask 1 [15 points] : $N \leq 2$, There are at most 2 buttons Subtask 2 [45 points] : $N \leq 1000$, There are at most 1000 buttons Subtask 3 [40 points] : No additional constraints. -----Sample Input:----- 3 4 3 5 3 4 2 5 7 1 4 -----Sample Output:----- 3 0 0 -----EXPLANATION:----- This section uses 1-indexing. In the first sample, the buttons are: $[3, 5, 3, 4]$ $A[1] +  A[4] = 3 + 4 = 7$ which is odd. $A[2] +  A[4] = 5 + 4 = 9$ which is odd. $A[3] +  A[4] = 3 + 4 = 7$ which is odd. In total, there are 3 pairs with an odd sum, so the answer is 3. In the second sample, the buttons are: $[5, 7]$. There are no odd pairs, so the answer is $0$. In the third sample, the buttons are: $[4]$. There are no pairs at all, so the answer is $0$.
