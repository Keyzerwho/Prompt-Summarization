 You are given N trees planted in Mr. Smith's garden. The height of the i-th tree (1 i N) is h i meters. He decides to choose K trees from these trees and decorate them with electric lights. To make the scenery more beautiful, the heights of the decorated trees should be as close to each other as possible. 
-----Input Format----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N K  h1  h2  :  hN -----Output----- Print the minimum possible value of hmax−hmin. 		 		 -----Example Text Case----- Input: 5 3 10 15 11 14 12 Output: 2 Explanation If we decorate the first, third and fifth trees, hmax=12,hmin=10 so hmax−hmin=2. This is optimal.
