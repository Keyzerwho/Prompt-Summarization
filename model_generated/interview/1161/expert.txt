 Given an array, find the maximum possible number of snakes that can be eaten. 
-----Input----- First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a string consisting of characters 's' and 'm'.  -----Output----- For each test case output a single line containing "snakes", "mongooses" or "tie" correspondingly (without quotes). -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 -----Example----- Input 4 sm ssm sms ssmmmssss Output mongooses tie tie snakes -----Explanation----- Example 1. The mongoose will eat the snake. Only the mongoose will be left. So, on the election day, there is one mongoose and zero snakes. So mongooses will win. Example 2. The mongoose will eat the snake at position 2 (1-based indexing). One mongoose and one snake will be left. Hence, there will be a tie. Example 3. The mongoose can eat either the snake to its left or to the right. But, it can eat only one of them. Afterwards, there will be a single snake and mongoose. So, it will result in a tie.  Example 4. The mongooses can eat at max two snakes. For example, s*mmm*sss, where * denotes the snakes that were eaten by mongooses. After this, we have four snakes and three mongooses. So, the snakes win.
