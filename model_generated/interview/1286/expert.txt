 Wet Shark once had 2 sequences:  {a_n}= {a_1, a_2, a_3, ... , a_(109)}   {b_n} = {b_1, b_2, b_3, ... , b_(109)}   However, he only kept one element from each sequence. Luckily, both the elements that Wet Shark kept have the same index in Wet Shark's sequences: that is, he took a_i and b_i for some 1   i   109
-----Input----- The first line of input contains 3 space separated integers i, k, s — the common index of the two elements Wet Shark kept, the index of Wet Shark's array needed to break Cthulhu's code, and the number s described in the problem statement, respectively. It is guaranteed that Cthulhu's code, Q, is between -109 and 109 (both inclusive). The second line of the input contains 2 space separated integers a_i and b_i, representing the ith element of sequence {a_n} and the ith element of sequence {b_n}, respectively. -----Output----- Output any number c that will crack Cthulhu's code. Recall that if Wet Shark enters any code c such that |c - Q| ≤ 0.01 , Cthulhu's code checker will allow him to exit the labyrinth. ----- Constraints ----- -   SUBTASK 1: 20 POINTS   -  1 ≤ i ≤ 103  -  1 ≤ k ≤ 103  -  -103 ≤ s ≤ 103  -  1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 103  -   SUBTASK 2: 80 POINTS   -  1 ≤ i ≤ 1010  -  1 ≤ k ≤ 1010  -  -1010 ≤ s ≤ 1010  -  1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 1010  It is guaranteed that -1010 ≤ Q ≤  1010. -----Example----- Input: 1 1 5 4 5 Output: 0.28125 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. In this case, a_1 = 4, b_1 = 5, and s = 5. Cthulhu's code in this case is (a_1 + b_1) / (2s) = 9/32 = 0.28125.
