 A binary string $S$ is defined as follows: $S = ababab$. A binary string $U$ is special if $cnt_0 = cnt_1 \cdot cnt_1$. Today, Chef's friend Araspa is celebrating her birthday. Chef wants to give Araspa the most beautiful binary string he can find. Currently, he is checking out binary strings in a shop, but he needs your help to calculate their beauties. Tell Chef the beauty of each binary string he gives you. 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the beauty of the string $S$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \le T \le 10$ - $1 \le |S| \le 10^5$ - each character of $S$ is '0' or '1' -----Example Input----- 2 010001 10 -----Example Output----- 4 1 -----Explanation----- Example case 1: The special substrings correspond to $(i, j) = (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (5, 6)$.
