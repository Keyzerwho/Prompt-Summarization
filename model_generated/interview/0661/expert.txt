 Given an integer $N$, and it's integral square root $S$, His instructor will consider the answer correct if Difference between $N$ and the square of $S$ is within less than or equal to $X$% of $N$. For example, sqrt(3) = 1.73205080757  . His program will return the square of $N$ if difference between $N$ and the square of $S$ is within less than or equal to $X$% of $N$. For example, sqrt(3) = 1.
-----Input:----- - First line contains $T$ no. of test cases and $X$ separated by space - For every test case, a line contains an integer $N$ -----Output:----- For every test case, print yes  if his programs return square root and (N-(S^2)) <= 0.01XN . For everything else, print no on a new line -----Constraints----- 10 points: - $1 \leq T \leq 10$ - $0\leq N \leq 10$ 20 points: - $1 \leq T \leq 30000$ - $-10^9 \leq N \leq 10^9$ 70 points: - $1 \leq T \leq 10^6$ - $-10^9 \leq N \leq 10^9$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 20 5 3 -----Sample Output:----- yes no -----EXPLANATION:----- In #1, sqrt(5) = 2.2360679775. Taking integral value, S = 2. S2 = 4. Difference=1 which is within 20% of 5 In #1, sqrt(3) = 1.73205080757. Taking integral value, S = 1. S2 = 1. Difference=2  which is not within 20% of 3
