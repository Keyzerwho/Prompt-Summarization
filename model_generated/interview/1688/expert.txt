 You are given a valid LIS array. You are guaranteed that Chef's LIS array is valid, i.e. there exists at least one n-digit number corresponding to the given LIS array. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  For each test case, the first line contains an integer n denoting the number of digits in Chef's favourite number. The second line will contain n space separated integers denoting LIS array, i.e. LIS1, LIS2, ..., LISn. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single n-digit number (without leading zeroes) having exactly the given LIS array. If there are multiple n-digit numbers satisfying this requirement, any of them will be accepted. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 30 000 - 1 ≤ n ≤ 9 - It is guaranteed that at least one n-digit number having the given LIS array exists -----Example----- Input: 5 1  1 2  1 2 2  1 1 4 1 2 2 1 7  1 2 2 1 3 2 4 Output: 7 36 54 1531 1730418 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. All one-digit numbers have the same LIS array, so any answer from 0 to 9 will be accepted. Example cases 2 & 3. For a two digit number we always have LIS1 = 1, but the value of LIS2 depends on whether the first digit is strictly less than the second one. If this is the case (like for number 36), LIS2 = 2, otherwise (like for numbers 54 or 77) the values of LIS2 is 1. Example case 4. This has already been explained in the problem statement. Example case 5. 7-digit number 1730418 has LIS array [1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4]: indexLISlength117304181217304182317304182417304181517304183617304182717304184
