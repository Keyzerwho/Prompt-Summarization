 Two cheeky thieves (Chef being one of them, the more talented one of course) have came across each other in the underground vault of the State Bank of Churuland. They are shocked! Indeed, neither expect to meet a colleague in such a place with the same intentions to carry away all the money collected during Churufest 2015. They have carefully counted a total of exactly 1 billion (109) dollars in the bank vault. Now they must decide how to divide the booty. But there is one problem: the thieves have only M minutes to leave the bank before the police arrives. Also, the more time they spend in the vault, the less amount could carry away from the
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of input for each test case contains an integer M denoting the number of minutes until arrest and a double denoting the constant p. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing two space-separated doubles denoting the amount of dollars each thief will get in the optimal division. First number: dollars amassed by Chef, and second: by his colleague. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute error doesn't exceed 10-2. -----Constraints and subtasks----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 105 - 0 ≤ p ≤  1   Subtask 1 (15 points) :  1 ≤ M ≤ 3 Subtask 2 (55 points) :  1 ≤ M ≤  103 Subtask 3 (30 points) :  1 ≤ M ≤ 109 -----Example----- Input: 2 1 0.5 2 0.5 Output: 1000000000.0 0.0 500000000.0 500000000.0 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. In the second case, if decision isn't made at t = 0, total amount of money decreases to 5*108 at t = 1 which leads to a situation worse than the given solution.
