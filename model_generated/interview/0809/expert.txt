 Zaikia has $N$ sticks of distinct positive lengths $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N$. For no good reason at all, he wants to know if there is a triplet of sticks which when connected end-to-end will form a non-trivial triangle. Here non-trivial refers to a triangle with positive area. Help Zaikia know if such a triplet exists or not. If such a triplet exists, help him find the lexicographically largest applicable triplet.
