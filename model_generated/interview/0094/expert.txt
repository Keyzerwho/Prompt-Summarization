 RedDreamer has an array $a$ consisting of $n$ non-negative integers, and an unlucky integer $T$. Let's denote the misfortune of array $b$ having length $m$ as $f(b)$   the number of pairs of integers $(i, j)$ such that $1 \le i < j \le m$ and $b_i + b_j = T$. RedDreamer has to paint each element of $a$ into one of two colors, white and black (for each element, the color is chosen independently), and then
-----Input----- The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $T$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $0 \le T \le 10^9$) — the number of elements in the array and the unlucky integer, respectively.  The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 10^9$) — the elements of the array.  The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case print $n$ integers: $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_n$ (each $p_i$ is either $0$ or $1$) denoting the colors. If $p_i$ is $0$, then $a_i$ is white and belongs to the array $c$, otherwise it is black and belongs to the array $d$. If there are multiple answers that minimize the value of $f(c) + f(d)$, print any of them. -----Example----- Input 2 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 6 3 3 3 Output 1 0 0 1 1 0  1 0 0
