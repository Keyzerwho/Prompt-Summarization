 You are given an array $a$ of length $n$ consisting of zeros. You perform $n$ operations with this array: during the $i$-th operation, the following sequence of operations appears:  Choose the maximum by length subarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such segments choose the leftmost one;  Let this segment be $[l; r]$. If $r-l+1$ is odd (not divisible by $2$) then assign (set) $a[\frac{
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers $x , y$.  -----Output:----- For each testcase, print $YES$, if it is possible to complete coach task, else print $NO$(without quotes) in a separate line. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100000$ - $1 \leq x, y \leq$ 10^18 -----Sample Input:----- 2 1 2 2 3 -----Sample Output:----- YES YES
