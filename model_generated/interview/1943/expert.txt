 You are given two lists of closed intervals. You need to return the intersection of these two interval lists. 
Example 1: Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]] Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]] Â  Note: 0 <= A.length < 1000 0 <= B.length < 1000 0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9
