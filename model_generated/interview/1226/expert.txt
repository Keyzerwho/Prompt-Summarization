 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- First line contains single integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers n and m - the size of the board. Next n lines contain n strings, each of size m and consisted of digits 0 and 1. -----Output----- In T lines print T integer - the answers for the corresponding test. -----Constraints----- 1 <= T <= 50 2 <= n, m <= 100 -----Example----- Input: 2 3 9 001000001 111111010 100100100 7 9 010101110 110110111 010011111 100100000 000010100 011011000 000100101 Output: 9 10 -----Explanation----- Example case 1:  The optimized path is: (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (1, 8) -> (2, 8). The mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (0, 2), (0, 8). Example case 2:  The optimized path is: (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8). The 10 mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 8).
