 You are given N integers. You need to find out the number of minions which become Wolverine-like.
-----Input Format:----- The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines. The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement. The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions. -----Output Format:----- For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification. -----Constraints:----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ K ≤ 100 - All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive. -----Example----- Input: 1 5 10 2 4 1 35 1 Output: 1 -----Explanation:----- After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.
