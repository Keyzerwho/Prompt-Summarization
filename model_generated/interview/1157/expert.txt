 You are given a grid. There are K unit squares on the grid. You need to find expected value of the number of unit squares covered. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains one integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains 3 space-separated integers N, M, K, as described in the problem statement. The next line contains K space-separated integers, each a single number from 1 to M*N, representing a square that is painted with a heart. It is guaranteed that all K integers are distinct. -----Output----- Output T lines, each containing a single real number, containing the expected number of hearts that a randomly chosen rectangle will contain. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error does not exceed 10-6. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 5   - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 107   - 1 ≤ K ≤ 105  - Each of the K integers representing a heart are between 1 and N*M, inclusive. All K integers are distinct.  -----Subtasks-----Subtask 1 (15 points) :  - 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10 - 1 ≤ K ≤ N * M   Subtask 2 (85 points) : no additional constraints  -----Example----- Input: 1 2 2 2 1 2 Output: 0.8888888888888888 -----Explanation----- There are a total of 9 possible rectangles Thik could draw, shown in the figure above, and grid squares 1 and 2 are painted with a heart. The top row of possible selections (shown in the figure) contain 1, 0, 1, 2, and 2 hearts (from left to right), and the bottom row of possible selections (in the figure) contain 1, 0, 1, and 0 hearts. Therefore, 3/9 of the time 0 hearts are contained in the rectangle, 4/9 of the times 1 heart is contained in the rectangle, and 2/9 of the time 2 hearts are contained in the rectangle. The expected value is then 0 * 3/9 + 1 * 4/9 + 2 * 2/9 = 8/9.
