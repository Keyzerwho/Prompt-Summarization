 You are given a list of N points. You must find the sum of areas of all the triangles the Chef makes. 
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows. - The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of points on the plane. - The next N lines contain 2 space separated integers x and y denoting the coordinates of the points.  -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the answer. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error is less than or equal to 10-2. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 20 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 2000 - 1 ≤ x ≤ 3 - 1 ≤ y ≤106 - All (x, y) pairs are distinct -----Example----- Input: 2 3 1 1 2 1 3 3 4 1 1 2 2 2 1 3 3 Output: 1.0 2.0 -----Explanation:----- Test Case 1: There is only one triangle which has non-zero area, and it's area is 1, hence the output. Test Case 2: Let the points be A(1,1), B(2,2), C(2,1), D(3,3). There are 3 non degenerate triangles possible.  -  area ABC = 0.5 -  area BCD = 0.5 -  area ACD = 1 Total area = 2
