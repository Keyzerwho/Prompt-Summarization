 You are given a list of N ($N \in \{2,3,4,5\}$) integers. Your task is to determine the winner of this game. Output "tie" if there are two or more players with same maximum score, "chef" if only Chef has a maximum score, winner's index in all other cases. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. This will be followed by T test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of players. The second line of each test case contains an integer c[i] denoting the number of cookies in the i-th storage, followed by c[i] space-separated integers type[i][j] which denote the type if j-th cookie in the storage i-th. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing the answer as specified in the statement. -----Constraints and Subtasks-----Subtask #1 : (20 points)   - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10  - 1 ≤  N  ≤ 100   - 1 ≤  c[i]  ≤  100   - 1 ≤  type[i][j]  ≤  3    Subtask #2 : (80 points)   - 1 ≤ T ≤ 10  - 1 ≤  N  ≤ 100   - 1 ≤  c[i]  ≤  100   - 1 ≤  type[i][j]  ≤  6   -----Example----- Input: 3 2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 2 5 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 4 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 2 3 4 1 2 3 3 Output: chef 2 tie -----Explanation----- Example case 1. Chef has total 6 cookie, so he gets 6 points for that. Also, he can put all his cookies (as they are all distinct) in a bag of size 6. It will fetch him additional 4 points. So, Chef's total points will be 10. The second player has 9 cookies, he gets 9 points for that. Other than this, he can't create a bag with either 4, 5 or 6 distinct cookies. So, his final score is 9. 10 > 9 - Chef wins. Example case 2. Chef has 5 + 2 (a bag with 5 different cookies) = 7. The second player has 7 + 1(a bag with 4 different cookies) = 8. 7 < 8 - the second player wins. Example case 3. Every player has 4 cookies and can't create any bag of sweets. So, it's a tie.
