 
-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.  - The first line of each test case will contain $N$, representing the number of students who attended the exam. - Next line contains  $N$ spaced integers representing the number of "Pass" counted by each of the $N$ students. -----Output:----- - For each test case, output the answer in a single line.  - If the counts reported by the students are not consistent with each other or if it's not possible to predict the number of failed students from the given input, then print -1. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 50$ - $1 \leq N \leq 10^{5}$ - $0 \leq$ Count given by each Student $\leq 10^{5}$ -----Sample Input:----- 1 4 3 2 2 2 -----Sample Output:----- 1 -----EXPLANATION:----- There are 4 students, and they counted the number of passed students as 3,2,2,2. The first student can see that all others have passed, and all other students can see only 2 students who have passed. Hence, the first student must have failed, and others have all passed. Hence, the answer is 1.
