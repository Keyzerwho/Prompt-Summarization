 You are given a list of n jobs to do before the kitchen can be closed for the night. These jobs are indexed from 1 to n.  The cooks logged which jobs they finished before they left. Unfortunately, these jobs were not recorded in any particular order. Given an unsorted list of finished jobs, you are to determine which jobs the Chef must complete and which jobs his assitant must complete before closing the kitchen for the evening.
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer T ≤ 50 indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two numbers n,m satisfying 0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 1000. Here, n is the total number of jobs that must be completed before closing and m is the number of jobs that have already been completed. The second line contains a list of m distinct integers between 1 and n. These are the indices of the jobs that have already been completed. Consecutive integers are separated by a single space. -----Output----- The output for each test case consists of two lines. The first line is a list of the indices of the jobs assigned to the Chef. The second line is a list of the indices of the jobs assigned to his assistant. Both lists must appear in increasing order of indices and consecutive integers should be separated by a single space. If either the Chef or the assistant is not assigned any jobs, then their corresponding line should be blank. -----Example----- Input: 3 6 3 2 4 1 3 2 3 2 8 2 3 8 Output: 3 6 5 1 1 4 6 2 5 7
