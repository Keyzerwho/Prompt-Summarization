 You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $T$ ($1 \le T \le 1\,000$). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \le a, b \le 10^{9}$) — the current volume and Bob's desired volume, respectively. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from $a$ to $b$. If Bob does not need to change the volume (i.e. $a=b$), then print $0$. -----Example----- Input 3 4 0 5 14 3 9 Output 2 3 2 -----Note----- In the first example, Bob can press the $-2$ button twice to reach $0$. Note that Bob can not press $-5$ when the volume is $4$ since it will make the volume negative.  In the second example, one of the optimal ways for Bob is to press the $+5$ twice, then press $-1$ once. In the last example, Bob can press the $+5$ once, then press $+1$.
