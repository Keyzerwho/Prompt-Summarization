 You are given a string $S$ of length $N$. $S$ consists of $M$ characters. Each character is either lowercase English letter or the character '#'. 
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of testcases. - The first line of each test case contains $2$ space separated integers denoting the values of $N$ and $M$ respectively. - $N$ lines follow. Each line contains a string $S_i$ of length $M$ as described above. -----Output----- For every test case, print a line containing lexicographically lowest possible gift string. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$ - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^6$ - $|S_i| = M$ - All $S_i$ will contain either a lower English letter ('a' to 'z' ) or the character '#' (ASCII $35$). - Sum of $N * M$ over all test cases for a particular test file does not exceed $10^7$. - It is guaranteed that a valid solution will always exist. -----Sample Input----- 2 3 3 xab a#z caa 5 4 pyqs vcot qbiu lihj uvmz -----Sample Output----- xabza pvcbihjz -----Explanation----- For test $1$: The array $a$ chosen is: $[3, 3]$ The resulting string $P$ is formed by = $S_{1}[1, 3]$ + $S_{2}[3, 3]$ + $S_{3}[3, 3]$ = xabza For test $2$: The array $a$ chosen is: $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ The resulting string $P$ is formed by = $S_{1}[1, 1]$ + $S_{2}[1, 2]$ + $S_{3}[2, 3]$ + $S_{4}[3, 4]$ + $S_{5}[4, 4]$ = pvcbihjz
