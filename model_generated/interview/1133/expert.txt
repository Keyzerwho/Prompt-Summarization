 You are given an integer array A of length N. You need to find the length of each wire piece. 
Note: You cannot make a connection which requires a wire piece of length X with a wire piece of length Y if X≠Y. Input: ·        The first line of the input contains T = Number of Test cases ·        The first line of each test case contains an integer N ·        The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, …., AN. Output: For each test case print a single line containing two space separated integers, length of each wire and the corresponding minimum cost. Constraints: ·       1 <= T <= 10 ·       1 <= N <= 10^5 ·        1 <= Ai <= 10^5, for each valid i Sample Input: 1 3 2 4 8 Sample Output: 2 7
