 Given an expression with integer operands and the following binary Bitwise operators -  AND, OR and XOR. Find the maximum possible answer of the expression, given that he can perform the operation in any order i.e not necessarily follow the rule of Precedence of operators while evaluating the expression. 
-----Input:----- - The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. - The only line of input for each test case is a $string$ which is the Chef's expression to evaluate. -----Output:----- For each test case print a single integer i.e the maximum possible value of Chef's expression. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 100$. - The number of OPERATORS in the expression will be atleast 1 and atmost 10. - Each OPERAND may range from 0 to $10^9$. -----Subtasks----- - 10 points : The number of OPERATORS in the expression will be atmost 5. - 20 points : The number of OPERATORS in the expression will be atmost 8. - 70 points : Original constraints. -----Sample Input:----- 2 3^40|10^2 92^95|56&2&3 -----Sample Output:----- 43 95 -----EXPLANATION:-----CASE 2 : - If we first compute (56 & 2), the expression becomes 92^95|0&3, since (56 & 2) yields $0$. - Now on computing (95 | 0), the expression becomes 92^95&3. - Further on computing (95 & 3), the expression becomes 92^3. - Finally (92 ^ 3) yields 95, which is the maximum value of the expression.
