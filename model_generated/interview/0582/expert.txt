 The input given are lists of strings. You need to write a method ```findMinTimeCounterAttack``` that accepts the input and outputs the minimum time at which Chef can launch his counter attack. If Chef is unable to counter attack, answer $-1$. Formally, you are given a string $S$ of length $N$ consisting only of opening brackets $($ and closing brackets $)$. The substring of $S$ starting at index $L$ and ending at index $R$, i.e. $S_L S_{L+
-----Input----- - The first line contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of testcases. - The first line of each test case contains the string $S$. - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of cases to consider. - The next line contains $Q$ space separated integers, each denoting $t_i$. -----Output----- For each query, print the minimum value of $x$ in a separate line. If no such $x$ exists, print $-1$. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$ - $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^7$ - $1 \leq Q \leq 10^6$ - $1 \leq t_i \leq N$ - Every character of $S$ is either $($ or $)$. - Sum of $|S|$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $10^7$ and $10^6$ respectively. -----Sample Input----- 1 )())((() 3 1 7 6 -----Sample Output----- 3 8 -1 -----Explanation----- For the first query, Chef chooses to let $S_1$ pass through him, gets hit by $S_2$ and finally completes a balanced bracket sequence by adding $S_3$ to $S_2$ at time $x$ = $3$.
