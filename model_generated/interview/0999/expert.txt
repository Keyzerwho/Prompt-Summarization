 Chef wants to find a pattern that can be formed with K numbers. The chef needs to make sure that K numbers (which can be 0, 1, 2, ..., n) are repeated in this pattern. 
-----Input:----- -First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. -Each test case contains a single line of input, one integer $K$. -----Output:----- For each test case, output as the pattern. -----Constraints----- - $1 \leq T \leq 26$ - $1 \leq K \leq 26$ -----Sample Input:----- 2 2 4 -----Sample Output:----- A 12 A 12 ABC 1234 -----EXPLANATION:----- No need, else pattern can be decode easily.
