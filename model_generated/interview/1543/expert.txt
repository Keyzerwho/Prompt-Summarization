 Your task is to find the smallest k such that every integer between 0 and n-1 is in some set.
-----Input----- The first line contains a single positive integer t ≤ 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n,m where n is the size of X and m is the number of sets Si. Then m lines follow where the i'th such line begins with an integer vi between 1 and n (inclusive) indicating the size of Si. Following this are vi distinct integers between 0 and n-1 that describe the contents of Si. You are guaranteed that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤  30. Furthermore, each number between 0 and n-1 will appear in at least one set Si. -----Output----- For each test case you are to output a single integer indicating the minimum number of atoms that X can be partitioned into to satisfy the constraints. -----Example----- Input: 2 5 2 3 0 1 2 3 2 3 4 4 3 2 0 1 2 1 2 2 2 3 Output: 3 4
