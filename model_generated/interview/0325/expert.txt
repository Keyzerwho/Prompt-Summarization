 You are given an N x N grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land. Find the farthest water cell. The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.   Example 1: Input: [[1,0,1]
