 You are given a list of $n$ stations. You want to assign stations to contractors. You want to minimize the maximum traffic of contractors. 
-----Input:----- The first line of the input contains one integer $N$ indicating the number of railways stations in the network. The stations are numbered $1,2,..., N$. This is followed by $N$ lines of input, lines $2,3,...,N+1$, indicating the volume of traffic at each station. The volume of traffic at station $i$, $1 \leq i \leq N$, is given by a single integer in line $i+1$. The next $N-1$ lines of input, lines $N+2, N+3, ..., 2 \cdot N$, describe the railway network. Each of these lines contains two integers, denoting a pair of stations that are neighbours. -----Output:----- The output should be a single integer, corresponding to the minimum possible value of the maximum traffic of any contractor among all valid assignment of the stations to the three contractors. -----Constraints:----- - $1 \leq N \leq 3000$. -----Sample Input----- 6 10 20 25 40 30 30 4 5 1 3 3 4 2 3 6 4 -----Sample Output----- 70
