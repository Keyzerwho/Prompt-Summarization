 You are given two strings. Return the longest common pattern length between them.
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a string A. The next line contains another character string B. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer, the longest common pattern length between A and B. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ |A|, |B| ≤ 10000 (104), where |S| denotes the length of the string S - Both of A and B can contain only alphabet characters (both lower and upper case) and digits -----Example----- Input: 4 abcd xyz abcd bcda aabc acaa Codechef elfedcc Output: 0 4 3 5 -----Explanation----- Example case 1. There is no common character. Example case 2. All the characters are same. Example case 3. Three characters (a, a and c) are same. Example case 4. This sample is mentioned by the statement.
