 You are given an array of integers. Make a grid of squares. Each square should consist of integers from 1 to N, where N is the number of integers written on the board. The squares should be arranged so that each integer appears exactly once in a square. Return the number of such grids that can be formed. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of integers they wrote on the board. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the integers themselves. -----Output----- For each test case, output a single line containing either “Henry” or “Derek” (without quotes), denoting the winner of the game. -----Constraints----- - 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000 - 1 ≤ N ≤ 100 - 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1018 -----Example----- Input:2 2 3 4 3 1 3 5 Output:Henry Derek -----Explanation----- Example case 1. In this test case, the numbers on the board are [3,4]. Henry can win by selecting 4 and then dividing it by 2. The integers on the board are now [3,2]. Derek now has a couple of choices: - Derek can divide 2 by 3, 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 3, and Henry can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game. - Derek can divide 3 by 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 2, and Henry can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game. - Derek can divide 2 by 2. Now the integers are [1,3]. Henry can respond by dividing 3 by 3. The integers are now [1,1]. Now Derek has no choice but to divide 1 by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and remove it (because it becomes 0). Henry can respond by dividing the remaining 1 by 2 to finish, and win, the game. - Derek can divide 3 by 2 or 3. Now the integers are [1,2]. Henry can respond by dividing 2 by 2. The integers are now [1,1]. This leads to a situation as in the previous case and Henry wins.
