-----Input:----- - First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.  - Each test case contains of a single line of input $N$ till which sum of all prime numbers between 1 to n has to be calculated. -----Output:----- For each test case, output in a single line answer to the victory number. -----Constraints----- - $1 <= T <= 1000$ - $1 <= N <= 10^6$ -----Sample Input:----- 3 22 13 10 -----Sample Output:----- 77 41 17
