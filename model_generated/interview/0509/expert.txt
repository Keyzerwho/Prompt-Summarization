 You are given a graph with N vertices and M edges. Snuke will label the vertices with integers between 1 and N-1 (inclusive). Snuke will label the edges with integers between 1 and M (inclusive). Snuke will write an integer between 1 and N (inclusive) on each vertex. Snuke will keep only the edges which satisfy the following condition: exactly one of the integers written on the vertices is the label of the edge. 
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M u_1 v_1 c_1 \vdots u_M v_M c_M -----Output----- If there is no good way of writing integers, print No. Otherwise, print N lines. The i-th line should contain the integer written on Vertex i. Any good way of writing integers will be accepted. -----Sample Input----- 3 4 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 1 3 1 -----Sample Output----- 1 2 1  - We write 1, 2, and 1 on Vertex 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  - Edge 1 connects Vertex 1 and 2, and its label is 1.  - Only the integer written on Vertex 1 equals the label, so this edge will not get removed.  - Edge 2 connects Vertex 2 and 3, and its label is 2.  - Only the integer written on Vertex 2 equals the label, so this edge will not be removed.  - Edge 3 connects Vertex 1 and 3, and its label is 3.  - Both integers written on the vertices differ from the label, so this edge will be removed.  - Edge 4 connects Vertex 1 and 3, and its label is 1.  - Both integers written on the vertices equal the label, so this edge will be removed.  - After Edge 3 and 4 are removed, the graph will still be connected, so this is a good way of writing integers.
