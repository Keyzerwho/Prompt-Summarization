 Given a set of numbers, find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\{s \oplus k | s \in S\} = S$ or report that there is no such number. 
-----Input----- In the first line of input, there is a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1024$), the number of test cases. In the next lines, $t$ test cases follow. Each of them consists of two lines.  In the first line there is a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1024$) denoting the number of elements in set $S$. Second line consists of $n$ distinct integers $s_i$ ($0 \leq s_i < 1024$), elements of $S$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases will not exceed $1024$. -----Output----- Print $t$ lines; $i$-th line should contain the answer to the $i$-th test case, the minimal positive integer $k$ satisfying the conditions or $-1$ if no such $k$ exists. -----Example----- Input 6 4 1 0 2 3 6 10 7 14 8 3 12 2 0 2 3 1 2 3 6 1 4 6 10 11 12 2 0 1023 Output 1 4 2 -1 -1 1023 -----Note----- In the first test case, the answer is $1$ because it is a minimum positive integer and it satisfies all the conditions.
