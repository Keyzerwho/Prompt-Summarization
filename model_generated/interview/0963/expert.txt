 You are given an array arr. Calculate and return the sum of all possible odd-length subarrays. Example 1: Input: arr = [1,4,2,5,3] Output: 58 Explanation: The odd-length subarrays of arr and their sums are: [1] = 1 [4] = 4 [2] = 2 [5] = 5 [3] = 3 [1,4,2] = 7 [4,2,5] = 
-----Input----- - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$. - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs. -----Constraints----- - $2 \le N \le 10^5$ - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$ - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$ - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ -----Example Input----- 1 6 4 16 32 6 8 2 -----Example Output----- 2     -----Explanation----- Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.
