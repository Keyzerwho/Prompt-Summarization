 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains three space-separated integers, a, b and c (1 ≤ b < a < c ≤ 10^9), denoting the positions of Oleg, the first security guard and the second security guard, respectively. The next line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), denoting the number of banknotes. The next line of input contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9), denoting that the i-th banknote is located in the x_{i}-th safe. Note that x_{i} are not guaranteed to be distinct. -----Output----- Output a single integer: the maximum number of banknotes Oleg can take. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 7 8 4 7 5 5 3 6 2 8 Output 4 Input 6 5 7 5 1 5 7 92 3 Output 0 -----Note----- In the first example Oleg can take the banknotes in positions 4, 5, 6 (note that there are 2 banknotes at position 5). Oleg can't take the banknotes in safes 7 and 8 because he can't run into the second security guard. Similarly, Oleg cannot take the banknotes at positions 3 and 2 because he can't run into the first security guard. Thus, he can take a maximum of 4 banknotes. For the second sample, Oleg can't take any banknotes without bumping into any of the security guards.
