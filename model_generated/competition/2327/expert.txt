 You are given an array with some bits. there three possible combinations of bits 10, 11, 0. convert array to string and find if the last charecter should be a one bit charecter or not  Example 1: Input:  bits = [1, 0, 0] Output: True Explanation:  The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character. Example 2: Input:  bits = [1, 1, 1, 0
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N M l_1 r_1 : l_{N} r_{N} -----Output----- Print the answer in M lines. The i-th line should contain the maximum number of the kinds of souvenirs that can be purchased if one takes a train stopping every i-th station. -----Sample Input----- 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 3 -----Sample Output----- 3 2 2  - If one takes a train stopping every station, three kinds of souvenirs can be purchased: kind 1, 2 and 3.  - If one takes a train stopping every second station, two kinds of souvenirs can be purchased: kind 1 and 2.  - If one takes a train stopping every third station, two kinds of souvenirs can be purchased: kind 2 and 3.
