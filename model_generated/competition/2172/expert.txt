  Find $\sum_{i = 2}^{n} \frac{1}{v(i) u(i)}$. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) — the number of testscases.  Each of the following t lines of the input contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print t lines: the i-th of them must contain the answer to the i-th test as an irreducible fraction "p/q", where p, q are integers, q > 0. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 3 Output 1/6 7/30
