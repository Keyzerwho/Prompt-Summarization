 There are 2N balls in the xy-plane. The coordinates of the i-th of them is (x_i, y_i). Here, x_i and y_i are integers between 1 and N (inclusive) for all i, and no two balls occupy the same coordinates. In order to collect these balls, Snuke prepared 2N robots, N of type A and N of type B. Then, he placed the type-A robots at coordinates (1, 0), (2, 0), ..., 
-----Inputs----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N x_1 y_1 ... x_{2N} y_{2N} -----Outputs----- Print the number of the orders of activating the robots such that all the balls can be collected, modulo 1 000 000 007. -----Sample Input----- 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 -----Sample Output----- 8 We will refer to the robots placed at (1, 0) and (2, 0) as A1 and A2, respectively, and the robots placed at (0, 1) and (0, 2) as B1 and B2, respectively. There are eight orders of activation that satisfy the condition, as follows:  - A1, B1, A2, B2  - A1, B1, B2, A2  - A1, B2, B1, A2  - A2, B1, A1, B2  - B1, A1, B2, A2  - B1, A1, A2, B2  - B1, A2, A1, B2  - B2, A1, B1, A2 Thus, the output should be 8.
