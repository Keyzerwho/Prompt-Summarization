 The string s consists of parentheses and question marks (using Morse code through the lights). The coordinates are the number of pairs of integers (l, r) such that 1   l   r   |s| and the string s_{l}s_{l} + 1... s_{r} is pretty, where s_{i} is i-th character of s.
-----Input----- The first and only line of input contains string s, consisting only of characters '(', ')' and '?' (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000). -----Output----- Print the answer to Will's puzzle in the first and only line of output. -----Examples----- Input ((?)) Output 4 Input ??()?? Output 7 -----Note----- For the first sample testcase, the pretty substrings of s are:  "(?" which can be transformed to "()".  "?)" which can be transformed to "()".  "((?)" which can be transformed to "(())".  "(?))" which can be transformed to "(())".   For the second sample testcase, the pretty substrings of s are:  "??" which can be transformed to "()".  "()".  "??()" which can be transformed to "()()".  "?()?" which can be transformed to "(())".  "??" which can be transformed to "()".  "()??" which can be transformed to "()()".  "??()??" which can be transformed to "()()()".
