 Given an array of integers. Find the maximum number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r]. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 < n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n distinct integers s_1, s_2, ..., s_{n} (1 ≤ s_{i} ≤ 10^9). -----Output----- Print a single integer — the maximum lucky number among all lucky numbers of sequences s[l..r]. -----Examples----- Input 5 5 2 1 4 3 Output 7 Input 5 9 8 3 5 7 Output 15 -----Note----- For the first sample you can choose s[4..5] = {4, 3} and its lucky number is (4 xor 3) = 7. You can also choose s[1..2]. For the second sample you must choose s[2..5] = {8, 3, 5, 7}.
