 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$)  — the number of test cases. Next $3t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^5$)  — the length of the binary strings. The next two lines contain two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$. It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. -----Output----- For each test case, output an integer $k$ ($0\le k\le 2n$), followed by $k$ integers $p_1,\ldots,p_k$ ($1\le p_i\le n$). Here $k$ is the number of operations you use and $p_i$ is the length of the prefix you flip in the $i$-th operation. -----Example----- Input 5 2 01 10 5 01011 11100 2 01 01 10 0110011011 1000110100 1 0 1 Output 3 1 2 1 6 5 2 5 3 1 2 0 9 4 1 2 10 4 1 2 1 5 1 1 -----Note----- In the first test case, we have $01\to 11\to 00\to 10$. In the second test case, we have $01011\to 00101\to 11101\to 01000\to 10100\to 00100\to 11100$. In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length $2$, which will leave $a$ unchanged.
