 You are playing Osu! game. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of clicks. The second line contains n space-separated real numbers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 1). There will be at most six digits after the decimal point in the given p_{i}. -----Output----- Print a single real number — the expected score for your play. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 3 0.5 0.5 0.5 Output 2.750000000000000 Input 4 0.7 0.2 0.1 0.9 Output 2.489200000000000 Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output 25.000000000000000 -----Note----- For the first example. There are 8 possible outcomes. Each has a probability of 0.125.  "OOO"  →  3^2 = 9;  "OOX"  →  2^2 = 4;  "OXO"  →  1^2 + 1^2 = 2;  "OXX"  →  1^2 = 1;  "XOO"  →  2^2 = 4;  "XOX"  →  1^2 = 1;  "XXO"  →  1^2 = 1;  "XXX"  →  0.  So the expected score is $\frac{9 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1}{8} = 2.75$
