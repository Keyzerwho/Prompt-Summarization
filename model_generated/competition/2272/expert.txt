 You are given two integer sequences, each of length N: a_1, ..., a_N and b_1, ..., b_N. There are N^2 ways to choose two integers i and j such that 1 \leq i, j \leq N. For each of these N^2 pairs, we will compute a_i + b_j and write it on a sheet of paper. That is, we will write N^2 integers in total. Compute the XOR of these N^2 integers. Definition of XOR The XOR of integers c_1, c_
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N a_1 a_2 ... a_N b_1 b_2 ... b_N -----Output----- Print the result of the computation. -----Sample Input----- 2 1 2 3 4 -----Sample Output----- 2 On the sheet, the following four integers will be written: 4(1+3), 5(1+4), 5(2+3) and 6(2+4).
