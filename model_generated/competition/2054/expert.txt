 Timofey has a friend named Rabbit. Rabbit wants to hop from one point to another point on the 2D plane. Rabbit is only allowed to jump if the Euclidean distance between the endpoints of a hop is one of his $n$ favorite numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.  Rabbit wants to hop from $(0,0)$ to $(x,0)$. He needs to make at most $k$ jumps. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of vertices in the tree. Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v), denoting there is an edge between vertices u and v. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. The next line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^5), denoting the colors of the vertices. -----Output----- Print "NO" in a single line, if Timofey can't take the tree in such a way that it doesn't annoy him. Otherwise print "YES" in the first line. In the second line print the index of the vertex which Timofey should take in hands. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 2 1 1 Output YES 2 Input 3 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 Output YES 2 Input 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 2 1 2 Output NO
