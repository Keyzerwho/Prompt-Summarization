 You are given a string. You need to find all possible address formats of the recorded Internet resource, where <protocol> can equal either "http" (without the quotes) or "ftp" (without the quotes), <domain> is a non-empty string, consisting of lowercase English letters, the /<context> part may not be present. If it is present, then <context> is a non-empty string, consisting of lowercase English letters.  If string <context> isn't present in the address, then the additional character "/" isn't written. Thus,
-----Input----- The first line contains a non-empty string that Vasya wrote out in his notebook. This line consists of lowercase English letters only.  It is guaranteed that the given string contains at most 50 letters. It is guaranteed that the given string can be obtained from some correct Internet resource address, described above. -----Output----- Print a single line â€” the address of the Internet resource that Vasya liked. If there are several addresses that meet the problem limitations, you are allowed to print any of them. -----Examples----- Input httpsunrux Output http://sun.ru/x Input ftphttprururu Output ftp://http.ru/ruru -----Note----- In the second sample there are two more possible answers: "ftp://httpruru.ru" and "ftp://httpru.ru/ru".
