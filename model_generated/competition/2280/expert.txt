 You are given $q$ queries, each query is represented by an integer $u$: If the $u$-th mirror isn't a checkpoint then we set it as a checkpoint. Otherwise, the $u$-th mirror is no longer a checkpoint. After each query, you need to calculate the expected number of days until Creatnx becomes happy. Each of this numbers should be found by modulo $998244353$. Formally, let $M = 998244353$. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$, $q$ ($2 \leq n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)  — the number of mirrors and queries. The second line contains $n$ integers: $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq 100$). Each of $q$ following lines contains a single integer $u$ ($2 \leq u \leq n$) — next query. -----Output----- Print $q$ numbers – the answers after each query by modulo $998244353$. -----Examples----- Input 2 2 50 50 2 2 Output 4 6 Input 5 5 10 20 30 40 50 2 3 4 5 3 Output 117 665496274 332748143 831870317 499122211 -----Note----- In the first test after the first query, the first and the second mirrors are checkpoints. Creatnx will ask the first mirror until it will say that he is beautiful, after that he will ask the second mirror until it will say that he is beautiful because the second mirror is a checkpoint. After that, he will become happy. Probabilities that the mirrors will say, that he is beautiful are equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. So, the expected number of days, until one mirror will say, that he is beautiful is equal to $2$ and the answer will be equal to $4 = 2 + 2$.
