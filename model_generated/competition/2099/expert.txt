 You are given a number of magnitude 1. You need to divide this number into as many positive parts as possible such that at any moment given a part A,  you can divide into only two parts B and C, such that B does not exceed C times some constant. 
-----Input----- The single line of the input contains two space-separated positive integers n, k (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5). -----Output----- Print n integers forming the permutation. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 Output 1 3 2 Input 3 1 Output 1 2 3 Input 5 2 Output 1 3 2 4 5 -----Note----- By |x| we denote the absolute value of number x.
