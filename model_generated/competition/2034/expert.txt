 You are given $n$ points on the plane. The polygon formed from all the $n$ points is strictly convex, that is, the polygon is convex, and there are no three collinear points (i.e. lying in the same straight line). The points are numbered from $1$ to $n$, in clockwise order. We define the distance between two points $p_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $p_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ as their Manhattan distance: $$d(p_1, p_
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 3\cdot 10^5$) — the number of points.  Each of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^8 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^8$) — the coordinates of point $p_i$. The set of points is guaranteed to be convex, all points are distinct, the points are ordered in clockwise order, and there will be no three collinear points. -----Output----- For each $i$ ($3\leq i\leq n$), output $f(i)$. -----Examples----- Input 4 2 4 4 3 3 0 1 3 Output 12 14  Input 3 0 0 0 2 2 0 Output 8  -----Note----- In the first example, for $f(3)$, we consider four possible polygons:   ($p_1, p_2, p_3$), with perimeter $12$.  ($p_1, p_2, p_4$), with perimeter $8$.  ($p_1, p_3, p_4$), with perimeter $12$.  ($p_2, p_3, p_4$), with perimeter $12$.  For $f(4)$, there is only one option, taking all the given points. Its perimeter $14$. In the second example, there is only one possible polygon. Its perimeter is $8$.
