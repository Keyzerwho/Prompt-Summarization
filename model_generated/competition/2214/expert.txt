 For every possible x determine the number of ways of improving the quality of some roads in order to meet the citizens' condition. As those values can be rather large, you need to print each value modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7). 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of cities in the country. Next line contains n - 1 positive integers p_2, p_3, p_4, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ i - 1) — the description of the roads in the country. Number p_{i} means that the country has a road connecting city p_{i} and city i.  -----Output----- Print n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} is the sought number of ways to improve the quality of the roads modulo 1 000 000 007 (10^9 + 7), if the capital of the country is at city number i. -----Examples----- Input 3 1 1 Output 4 3 3 Input 5 1 2 3 4 Output 5 8 9 8 5
