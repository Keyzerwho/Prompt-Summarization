 The input given is an array. You need to write a program which finds representation of given array with one or several increasing sequences in accordance with algorithm described above.
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of elements in Ivan's array. The second line contains a sequence consisting of distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — Ivan's array. -----Output----- Print representation of the given array in the form of one or more increasing sequences in accordance with the algorithm described above. Each sequence must be printed on a new line. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 3 2 5 4 Output 1 3 5  2 4  Input 4 4 3 2 1 Output 4  3  2  1  Input 4 10 30 50 101 Output 10 30 50 101
