 You are given sequences A and B consisting of non-negative integers. The lengths of both A and B are N, and the sums of the elements in A and B are equal. Tozan and Gezan repeats the following sequence of operations:  - If A and B are equal sequences, terminate the process.  - Otherwise, first Tozan chooses a positive element in A and decrease it by 1.  - Then, Gezan chooses a positive element in B and decrease it by 1.  - Then, give one candy to Takahashi, their pet. Tozan wants the number of candies given to Takahashi until the process is terminated to be as large as possible, while
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N A_1 B_1 : A_N B_N -----Output----- Print the number of candies given to Takahashi when both Tozan and Gezan perform the operations optimally. -----Sample Input----- 2 1 2 3 2 -----Sample Output----- 2 When both Tozan and Gezan perform the operations optimally, the process will proceed as follows:  - Tozan decreases A_1 by 1.  - Gezan decreases B_1 by 1.  - One candy is given to Takahashi.  - Tozan decreases A_2 by 1.  - Gezan decreases B_1 by 1.  - One candy is given to Takahashi.  - As A and B are equal, the process is terminated.
