 You are given a deque $D$ filled with $n$ elements. The $i$-th element is $a_i$ ($i$ = $1, 2, \ldots, n$). Your task is to answer queries $q = \{m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_q\}$ where each query consists of a single number $m_j$ ($j = 1, 2, \ldots, q$). Your task is to answer which two elements Valeriy will pull out of the deque
-----Input----- The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $0 \leq q \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of elements in the deque and the number of queries. The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$, where $a_i$ $(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$ — the deque element in $i$-th position. The next $q$ lines contain one number each, meaning $m_j$ ($1 \leq m_j \leq 10^{18}$). -----Output----- For each teacher's query, output two numbers $A$ and $B$ — the numbers that Valeriy pulls out of the deque for the $m_j$-th operation. -----Examples----- Input 5 3 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 10 Output 1 2 2 3 5 2 Input 2 0 0 0 Output -----Note----- Consider all 10 steps for the first test in detail: $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ — on the first operation, $A$ and $B$ are $1$ and $2$, respectively. So, $2$ we write to the beginning of the deque, and $1$ — to the end. We get the following status of the deque: $[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]$. $[2, 3, 4, 5, 1] \Rightarrow A = 2, B = 3$. $[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$ $[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]$ $[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$ $[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]$ $[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]$ $[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]$ $[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]$ $[5, 2, 3, 4, 1] \Rightarrow A = 5, B = 2$.
