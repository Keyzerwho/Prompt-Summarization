 Borya wants to put his cards in a row to get one number. 
-----Input----- Input data contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input data contains an integer t — the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The descriptions of test cases follow. Each test is described by two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of cards in Borya's present. The second line contains n integers a_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9) — numbers written on the cards. It is guaranteed that the total number of cards in all tests of one input data doesn't exceed 2000. -----Output----- For each test case output one line: the number of ways to put the cards to the table so that the resulting big number was divisible by 11, print the number modulo 998244353. -----Example----- Input 4 2 1 1 3 1 31 12 3 12345 67 84 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Output 2 2 2 31680
