 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of cards in the deck. The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100 000), where a_{i} is the number written on the i-th from top card in the deck. -----Output----- Print the total number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck. -----Examples----- Input 4 6 3 1 2 Output 7 Input 1 1000 Output 1 Input 7 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Output 7 -----Note----- In the first example Vasily at first looks at the card with number 6 on it, puts it under the deck, then on the card with number 3, puts it under the deck, and then on the card with number 1. He places away the card with 1, because the number written on it is the minimum among the remaining cards. After that the cards from top to bottom are [2, 6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at the top card with number 2 and puts it away. After that the cards from top to bottom are [6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at card 6, puts it under the deck, then at card 3 and puts it away. Then there is only one card with number 6 on it, and Vasily looks at it and puts it away. Thus, in total Vasily looks at 7 cards.
