 You are given a sequence of weights. In each step, Duff can lift some of the remaining weights and throw them away. She does this until there's no more weight left. Help her minimize the number of steps. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), the number of weights. The second line contains n integers w_1, ..., w_{n} separated by spaces (0 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 10^6 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n), the powers of two forming the weights values. -----Output----- Print the minimum number of steps in a single line. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 1 2 3 3 Output 2 Input 4 0 1 2 3 Output 4 -----Note----- In the first sample case: One optimal way would be to throw away the first three in the first step and the rest in the second step. Also, it's not possible to do it in one step because their sum is not a power of two. In the second sample case: The only optimal way is to throw away one weight in each step. It's not possible to do it in less than 4 steps because there's no subset of weights with more than one weight and sum equal to a power of two.
