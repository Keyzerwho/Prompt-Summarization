 You are given a sequence a = \{a_1, ..., a_N\} with all zeros, and a sequence b = \{b_1, ..., b_N\} consisting of 0 and 1. The length of both is N. You can perform Q kinds of operations. The i-th operation is as follows:  - Replace each of a_{l_i}, a_{l_i + 1}, ..., a_{r_i} with 1. Minimize the hamming distance between a and b, that is, the number of i such that a_i
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N b_1 b_2 ... b_N Q l_1 r_1 l_2 r_2 : l_Q r_Q -----Output----- Print the minimum possible hamming distance. -----Sample Input----- 3 1 0 1 1 1 3 -----Sample Output----- 1 If you choose to perform the operation, a will become \{1, 1, 1\}, for a hamming distance of 1.
