 You are given n integers $w_{1}, w_{2}, \ldots, w_{n}$. You are asked to find the number of energy units the robot spends to collect all n items. 
-----Input----- The first line contains five integers n, l, r, Q_{l}, Q_{r} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; 1 ≤ l, r ≤ 100; 1 ≤ Q_{l}, Q_{r} ≤ 10^4). The second line contains n integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_{n} (1 ≤ w_{i} ≤ 100). -----Output----- In the single line print a single number — the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 4 19 1 42 3 99 Output 576 Input 4 7 2 3 9 1 2 3 4 Output 34 -----Note----- Consider the first sample. As l = r, we can take an item in turns: first from the left side, then from the right one and last item from the left. In total the robot spends 4·42 + 4·99 + 4·3 = 576 energy units. The second sample. The optimal solution is to take one item from the right, then one item from the left and two items from the right. In total the robot spends (2·4) + (7·1) + (2·3) + (2·2 + 9) = 34 energy units.
