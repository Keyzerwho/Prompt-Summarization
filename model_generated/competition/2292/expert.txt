 Given a string of length at least 1. We will call x a good string, if for any string y and any integer k (k \geq 2), the string obtained by concatenating k copies of y is different from x. For example, a, bbc and cdcdc are good strings, while aa, bbbb and cdcdcd are not. Let s be a string of length at least 1. For a sequence F=(\,f_1,\,f_2,\,...,\,f_m) consisting of m
