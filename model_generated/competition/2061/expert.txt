 We have three stones at points (0, 0), (1,0), and (0,1) on a two-dimensional plane. These three stones are said to form an L when they satisfy the following conditions:  - Each of the stones is at integer coordinates.  - Each of the stones is adjacent to another stone. (That is, for each stone, there is another stone whose distance from that stone is 1.)  - The three stones do not lie on the same line. Particularly, the initial arrangement of the stone - (0, 0),
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: T \text{case}_1 \vdots \text{case}_T Each case is in the following format: ax ay bx by cx cy -----Output----- Print T values. The i-th value should be the minimum number of operations for \text{case}_i. -----Sample Input----- 1 3 2 2 2 2 1 -----Sample Output----- 4 Let us use # to represent a stone. You can move the stones to the specified positions with four operations, as follows: ....    ....    ....    ..#.    ..## #... -> ##.. -> .##. -> .##. -> ..#. ##..    .#..    .#..    ....    ....
