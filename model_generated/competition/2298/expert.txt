 You are given a positive integer N, and 1   N   10^5 integers A_i (1   i   N). Your task is to find the minimum total cost for Takahashi's travel. You may assume that Takahashi's expected profit is initially at least 1 yen. 
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N T A_1 A_2 ... A_N -----Output----- Print the minimum total cost to decrease Takahashi's expected profit by at least 1 yen. -----Sample Input----- 3 2 100 50 200 -----Sample Output----- 1 In the initial state, Takahashi can achieve the maximum profit of 150 yen as follows:  - Move from town 1 to town 2.  - Buy one apple for 50 yen at town 2.  - Move from town 2 to town 3.  - Sell one apple for 200 yen at town 3. If, for example, Aoki changes the price of an apple at town 2 from 50 yen to 51 yen, Takahashi will not be able to achieve the profit of 150 yen. The cost of performing this operation is 1, thus the answer is 1. There are other ways to decrease Takahashi's expected profit, such as changing the price of an apple at town 3 from 200 yen to 199 yen.
