 You are given N numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Kalila and Dimna want to cut all the trees completely, with minimum cost.  They want you to help them! Will you  
-----Input----- The first line of input contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line of input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). The third line of input contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} (0 ≤ b_{i} ≤ 10^9). It's guaranteed that a_1 = 1, b_{n} = 0, a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} and b_1 > b_2 > ... > b_{n}. -----Output----- The only line of output must contain the minimum cost of cutting all the trees completely. Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier. -----Examples----- Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 0 Output 25 Input 6 1 2 3 10 20 30 6 5 4 3 2 0 Output 138
