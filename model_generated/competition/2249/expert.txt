 You are given a coordinate plane with $n$ points. For each point $p = 1, 2, \dots, n$, you need to find a minimum spanning tree. Then output the minimum cost required to move box from $p$ to $p$. 
-----Input----- Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 1000)$: the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each of the next $t$ lines contains four space-separated integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$ $(1 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 10^9)$, describing the next test case. -----Output----- For each test case, print a single integer: the minimum time in seconds Wabbit needs to bring the box from $(x_1,y_1)$ to $(x_2,y_2)$. -----Example----- Input 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 Output 1 4 -----Note----- In the first test case, the starting and the ending points of the box are $(1,2)$ and $(2,2)$ respectively. This is the same as the picture in the statement. Wabbit needs only $1$ second to move as shown in the picture in the statement. In the second test case, Wabbit can start at the point $(2,1)$. He pulls the box to $(2,1)$ while moving to $(3,1)$. He then moves to $(3,2)$ and then to $(2,2)$ without pulling the box. Then, he pulls the box to $(2,2)$ while moving to $(2,3)$. It takes $4$ seconds.
