 You are given an array of integers. You need to count the minimum sum of money that Maxim needs to buy them, if he use the discount system optimally well. Please assume that the supermarket has enough carts for any actions. Maxim can use the same discount multiple times. Of course, Maxim can buy items without any discounts. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) — the number of discount types. The second line contains m integers: q_1, q_2, ..., q_{m} (1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ 10^5).  The third line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of items Maxim needs. The fourth line contains n integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^4) — the items' prices. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. -----Output----- In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 1 2 4 50 50 100 100 Output 200 Input 2 2 3 5 50 50 50 50 50 Output 150 Input 1 1 7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 3 -----Note----- In the first sample Maxim needs to buy two items that cost 100 and get a discount for two free items that cost 50. In that case, Maxim is going to pay 200. In the second sample the best strategy for Maxim is to buy 3 items and get 2 items for free using the discount. In that case, Maxim is going to pay 150.
