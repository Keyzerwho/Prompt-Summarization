 You are given an integer a, written in the binary notation. You want to find the maximum number that he can obtain after deleting exactly one binary digit and print it in the binary notation. 
-----Input----- The single line contains integer a, written in the binary notation without leading zeroes. This number contains more than 1 and at most 10^5 digits. -----Output----- In the single line print the number that is written without leading zeroes in the binary notation — the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 101 Output 11 Input 110010 Output 11010 -----Note----- In the first sample the best strategy is to delete the second digit. That results in number 11_2 = 3_10. In the second sample the best strategy is to delete the third or fourth digits — that results in number 11010_2 = 26_10.
