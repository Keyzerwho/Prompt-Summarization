 You are given a map of some imaginary city with $n$ subway stations. Some stations are directly connected with tunnels in such a way that the whole map is a tree. It means there exists exactly one simple path between each pair of station. We call a path simple if it uses each tunnel no more than once. One of Sergey Semyonovich's favorite quality objectives is the sum of all pairwise distances between every pair of stations. The distance between two stations is the minimum possible number of tunnels on a path between them. Sergey Semyonovich decided to add new tunnels to the subway map. In particular, he connected any two stations $u$ and $v$ that were not connected with
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 200\,000$) — the number of subway stations in the imaginary city drawn by mayor's assistants. Each of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$, $u_i \ne v_i$), meaning the station with these indices are connected with a direct tunnel. It is guaranteed that these $n$ stations and $n - 1$ tunnels form a tree. -----Output----- Print one integer that is equal to the sum of distances between all pairs of stations after Sergey Semyonovich draws new tunnels between all pairs of stations that share a common neighbor in the original map. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output 6 Input 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 Output 7 -----Note----- In the first sample, in the new map all pairs of stations share a direct connection, so the sum of distances is $6$. In the second sample, the new map has a direct tunnel between all pairs of stations except for the pair $(1, 4)$. For these two stations the distance is $2$.
