 Given k types of orbs and n different p values, find minimum number of days (in days) he need wait before sending out ranger to collect orb such that the probability of him getting at least one of each kind of orb is at least $\frac{p_{i} - \epsilon}{2000}$, where   < 10^{ - 7}.
-----Input----- First line consists of two space separated integers k, q (1 ≤ k, q ≤ 1000) — number of different kinds of orbs and number of queries respectively. Each of the next q lines contain a single integer p_{i} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ 1000) — i-th query. -----Output----- Output q lines. On i-th of them output single integer — answer for i-th query. -----Examples----- Input 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 2 2 1 2 Output 2 2
