 =====Problem Statement===== You are given two sets A and B. A set B contains n elements. A player chooses a random element from set B. The other player should guess if the player chose element 1, 2, 3, ..., n, or infinity. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 7000) — number of objects in game. The second line contains integer k_1 followed by k_1 distinct integers s_{1, 1}, s_{1, 2}, ..., s_{1, }k_1 — Rick's set. The third line contains integer k_2 followed by k_2 distinct integers s_{2, 1}, s_{2, 2}, ..., s_{2, }k_2 — Morty's set 1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ n - 1 and 1 ≤ s_{i}, 1, s_{i}, 2, ..., s_{i}, k_{i} ≤ n - 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 2. -----Output----- In the first line print n - 1 words separated by spaces where i-th word is "Win" (without quotations) if in the scenario that Rick plays first and monster is initially in object number i + 1 he wins, "Lose" if he loses and "Loop" if the game will never end. Similarly, in the second line print n - 1 words separated by spaces where i-th word is "Win" (without quotations) if in the scenario that Morty plays first and monster is initially in object number i + 1 he wins, "Lose" if he loses and "Loop" if the game will never end. -----Examples----- Input 5 2 3 2 3 1 2 3 Output Lose Win Win Loop Loop Win Win Win Input 8 4 6 2 3 4 2 3 6 Output Win Win Win Win Win Win Win Lose Win Lose Lose Win Lose Lose
