 You are given an array of integers $x$ and an array of integers $y$. You need to count the number of unread notifications generated by phone applications. 
-----Input----- The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 300 000) — the number of applications and the number of events to happen. The next q lines contain the events. The i-th of these lines starts with an integer type_{i} — type of the i-th event. If type_{i} = 1 or type_{i} = 2 then it is followed by an integer x_{i}. Otherwise it is followed by an integer t_{i} (1 ≤ type_{i} ≤ 3, 1 ≤ x_{i} ≤ n, 1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ q). -----Output----- Print the number of unread notifications after each event. -----Examples----- Input 3 4 1 3 1 1 1 2 2 3 Output 1 2 3 2 Input 4 6 1 2 1 4 1 2 3 3 1 3 1 3 Output 1 2 3 0 1 2 -----Note----- In the first sample:  Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification).  Application 1 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications).  Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications).  Thor reads the notification generated by application 3, there are 2 unread notifications left.  In the second sample test:  Application 2 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification).  Application 4 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications).  Application 2 generates a notification (there are 3 unread notifications).  Thor reads first three notifications and since there are only three of them so far, there will be no unread notification left.  Application 3 generates a notification (there is 1 unread notification).  Application 3 generates a notification (there are 2 unread notifications).
