 You are given n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position. Vova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n -
-----Input----- The first line on the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, n is even) — the number of positions available initially. The second line contains n distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9), giving the coordinates of the corresponding positions. -----Output----- Print the distance between the warrior and the archer at the beginning of the fight, provided that both Vova and Lesha play optimally. -----Examples----- Input 6 0 1 3 7 15 31 Output 7 Input 2 73 37 Output 36 -----Note----- In the first sample one of the optimum behavior of the players looks like that:  Vova bans the position at coordinate 15;  Lesha bans the position at coordinate 3;  Vova bans the position at coordinate 31;  Lesha bans the position at coordinate 1.  After these actions only positions 0 and 7 will remain, and the distance between them is equal to 7. In the second sample there are only two possible positions, so there will be no bans.
