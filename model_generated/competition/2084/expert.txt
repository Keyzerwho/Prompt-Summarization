 You have two arrays. Each array contains an integer. Your task is to determine, for each array, whether the sum of its elements is prime or not. 
-----Input----- The first line contains number m (2 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). The following m lines contain the coordinates of the cubes x_{i}, y_{i} ( - 10^9 ≤ x_{i} ≤ 10^9, 0 ≤ y_{i} ≤ 10^9) in ascending order of numbers written on them. It is guaranteed that the original figure is stable. No two cubes occupy the same place. -----Output----- In the only line print the answer to the problem. -----Examples----- Input 3 2 1 1 0 0 1 Output 19 Input 5 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 Output 2930
