 Consider the infinite sequence $s$ of positive integers, created by repeating the following steps:   Find the lexicographically smallest triple of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ such that   $a \oplus b \oplus c = 0$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.  $a$, $b$, $c$ are not in $s$.  Here triple of integers $(a_1, b_1, c_1)$ is considered to be 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of test cases. Each of the next $t$ lines contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n \le 10^{16}$) — the position of the element you want to know. -----Output----- In each of the $t$ lines, output the answer to the corresponding test case. -----Example----- Input 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Output 1 2 3 4 8 12 5 10 15 -----Note----- The first elements of $s$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 5, 10, 15, \dots $
