 Given two strings, find the smallest index such that the first string is smaller than the second one. If no such index exists, return -1.
-----Input----- The first line of input contains a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5). All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Oleg has initially. The second line of input contains a string t of length n. All characters of the string are lowercase English letters. This string denotes the set of letters Igor has initially. -----Output----- The output should contain a string of n lowercase English letters, denoting the company name if Oleg and Igor plays optimally. -----Examples----- Input tinkoff zscoder Output fzfsirk Input xxxxxx xxxxxx Output xxxxxx Input ioi imo Output ioi -----Note----- One way to play optimally in the first sample is as follows : Initially, the company name is ???????. Oleg replaces the first question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes f??????. Igor replaces the second question mark with 'z'. The company name becomes fz?????. Oleg replaces the third question mark with 'f'. The company name becomes fzf????. Igor replaces the fourth question mark with 's'. The company name becomes fzfs???. Oleg replaces the fifth question mark with 'i'. The company name becomes fzfsi??. Igor replaces the sixth question mark with 'r'. The company name becomes fzfsir?. Oleg replaces the seventh question mark with 'k'. The company name becomes fzfsirk. For the second sample, no matter how they play, the company name will always be xxxxxx.
