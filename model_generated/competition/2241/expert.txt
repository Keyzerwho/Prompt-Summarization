 
-----Input----- The input is given from Standard Input in the following format: N C A_1 A_2 ... A_N B_1 B_2 ... B_N -----Output----- Print the value of  modulo 10^9+7. -----Sample Input----- 2 3 1 1 1 1 -----Sample Output----- 4 This case is included in the test set for the partial score, since A_i=B_i. We only have to consider the sum of the activity level of the kindergarten where the excitement level of both child 1 and child 2 are 1 (f(1,1)).  - If child 1 is given 0 candy, and child 2 is given 3 candies, the activity level of the kindergarten is 1^0*1^3=1.  - If child 1 is given 1 candy, and child 2 is given 2 candies, the activity level of the kindergarten is 1^1*1^2=1.  - If child 1 is given 2 candies, and child 2 is given 1 candy, the activity level of the kindergarten is 1^2*1^1=1.  - If child 1 is given 3 candies, and child 2 is given 0 candy, the activity level of the kindergarten is 1^3*1^0=1. Thus, f(1,1)=1+1+1+1=4, and the sum over all f is also 4.
