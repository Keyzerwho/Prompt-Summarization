 In the spirit of the holidays, Saitama has given Genos two grid paths of length n (a weird gift even by Saitama's standards). A grid path is an ordered sequence of neighbouring squares in an infinite grid. Two squares are neighbouring if they share a side. One example of a grid path is (0, 0)   (0, 1)   (0, 2)   (1, 2)   (1, 1)   (0, 1)   
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000) — the length of the paths. The second line of the input contains a string consisting of n - 1 characters (each of which is either 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W') — the first grid path. The characters can be thought of as the sequence of moves needed to traverse the grid path. For example, the example path in the problem statement can be expressed by the string "NNESWW". The third line of the input contains a string of n - 1 characters (each of which is either 'N', 'E', 'S', or 'W') — the second grid path. -----Output----- Print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible for both marbles to be at the end position at the same time. Print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise. In both cases, the answer is case-insensitive. -----Examples----- Input 7 NNESWW SWSWSW Output YES Input 3 NN SS Output NO -----Note----- In the first sample, the first grid path is the one described in the statement. Moreover, the following sequence of moves will get both marbles to the end: NNESWWSWSW. In the second sample, no sequence of moves can get both marbles to the end.
