 You are given an integer N (10^5) and an integer K (10^5). You need to find the smallest lexicographically sorted sequence of length N and length K in FEIS.  
-----Input----- Input is given from Standard Input in the following format: K N -----Output----- Print the (X/2)-th (rounded up to the nearest integer) lexicographically smallest sequence listed in FEIS, with spaces in between, where X is the total number of sequences listed in FEIS. -----Sample Input----- 3 2 -----Sample Output----- 2 1  There are 12 sequences listed in FEIS: (1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3). The (12/2 = 6)-th lexicographically smallest one among them is (2,1).
