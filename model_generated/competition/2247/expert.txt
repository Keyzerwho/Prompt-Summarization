 You are given a tree of n nodes numbered from 1 to n. You need to find the expectation of the number of steps in the game. 
-----Input----- The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of nodes in the tree. The next n - 1 lines contain the tree edges. The i-th line contains integers a_{i}, b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ n; a_{i} ≠ b_{i}) — the numbers of the nodes that are connected by the i-th edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. -----Output----- Print a single real number — the expectation of the number of steps in the described game. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 6}. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 2 Output 1.50000000000000000000 Input 3 1 2 1 3 Output 2.00000000000000000000 -----Note----- In the first sample, there are two cases. One is directly remove the root and another is remove the root after one step. Thus the expected steps are: 1 × (1 / 2) + 2 × (1 / 2) = 1.5 In the second sample, things get more complex. There are two cases that reduce to the first sample, and one case cleaned at once. Thus the expected steps are: 1 × (1 / 3) + (1 + 1.5) × (2 / 3) = (1 / 3) + (5 / 3) = 2
