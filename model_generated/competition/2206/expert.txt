 Dima and Sasha are friends. Recently, Dima met with Sasha in a philatelic store, and since then they are collecting coins together.  They like sorting collections of coins. Sasha likes having things in order, that is why he wants his coins to be arranged in a row in such a way that firstly come coins out of circulation, and then come coins still in circulation. Dima uses the following algorithm.  One step of his algorithm looks like the following:   He looks through all the coins from left to right;  If he sees that the i-th coin is still in circulation, and (i + 1)-th coin is already out of circulation, he
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300 000) — number of coins that Sasha puts behind Dima. Second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — positions that Sasha puts coins in circulation to. At first Sasha replaces coin located at position p_1, then coin located at position p_2 and so on. Coins are numbered from left to right. -----Output----- Print n + 1 numbers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n}, where a_0 is a hardness of ordering at the beginning, a_1 is a hardness of ordering after the first replacement and so on.  -----Examples----- Input 4 1 3 4 2 Output 1 2 3 2 1 Input 8 6 8 3 4 7 2 1 5 Output 1 2 2 3 4 3 4 5 1 -----Note----- Let's denote as O coin out of circulation, and as X — coin is circulation. At the first sample, initially in row there are coins that are not in circulation, so Dima will look through them from left to right and won't make any exchanges. After replacement of the first coin with a coin in circulation, Dima will exchange this coin with next three times and after that he will finally look through the coins and finish the process. XOOO  →  OOOX After replacement of the third coin, Dima's actions look this way: XOXO  →  OXOX  →  OOXX After replacement of the fourth coin, Dima's actions look this way: XOXX  →  OXXX Finally, after replacement of the second coin, row becomes consisting of coins that are in circulation and Dima will look through coins from left to right without any exchanges.
