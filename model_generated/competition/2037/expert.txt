 You are interested what is the minimum possible time you need to spend to deliver all the employees to their destination. It is not necessary to return the elevator to the floor 1. 
-----Input----- The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of employees. The i-th of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 9, a_{i} ≠ b_{i}) — the floor on which an employee initially is, and the floor he wants to reach. The employees are given in the order they came to the elevator. -----Output----- Print a single integer — the minimal possible time in seconds. -----Examples----- Input 2 3 5 5 3 Output 10 Input 2 5 3 3 5 Output 12 -----Note-----  Explaination for the first sample [Image] t = 0 [Image] t = 2 [Image] t = 3 [Image] t = 5 [Image] t = 6 [Image] t = 7 [Image] t = 9 [Image] t = 10
