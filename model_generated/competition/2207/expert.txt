 
-----Input----- The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of commands Polycarpus has fulfilled. Each of the following n lines contains three integers — the description of the commands. The i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers t_{i}, x_{i}, y_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 2; x_{i}, y_{i} ≥ 0; x_{i} + y_{i} = 10). If t_{i} = 1, then the i-th command is "ping a", otherwise the i-th command is "ping b". Numbers x_{i}, y_{i} represent the result of executing this command, that is, x_{i} packets reached the corresponding server successfully and y_{i} packets were lost. It is guaranteed that the input has at least one "ping a" command and at least one "ping b" command. -----Output----- In the first line print string "LIVE" (without the quotes) if server a is "alive", otherwise print "DEAD" (without the quotes). In the second line print the state of server b in the similar format. -----Examples----- Input 2 1 5 5 2 6 4 Output LIVE LIVE Input 3 1 0 10 2 0 10 1 10 0 Output LIVE DEAD -----Note----- Consider the first test case. There 10 packets were sent to server a, 5 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Overall there were 10 packets sent to server b, 6 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Consider the second test case. There were overall 20 packages sent to server a, 10 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network. Overall 10 packets were sent to server b, 0 of them reached it. Therefore, less than half of all packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.
