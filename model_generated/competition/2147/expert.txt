 Ziota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is rather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about the minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the monsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns). Please help him find this value. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains five integers separated by single spaces: $n$ $(2 \le n \le 10^6)$ — the number of stages, $r_1, r_2, r_3$ $(1 \le r_1 \le r_2 \le r_3 \le 10^9)$ — the reload time of the three guns respectively, $d$ $(1 \le d \le 10^9)$ — the time of moving between adjacent levels. The second line of the input contains $n$ integers separated by single spaces $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^6, 1 \le i \le n)$. -----Output----- Print one integer, the minimum time to finish the game. -----Examples----- Input 4 1 3 4 3 3 2 5 1 Output 34 Input 4 2 4 4 1 4 5 1 2 Output 31 -----Note----- In the first test case, the optimal strategy is:  Use the pistol to kill three normal monsters and AWP to kill the boss (Total time $1\cdot3+4=7$)  Move to stage two (Total time $7+3=10$)  Use the pistol twice and AWP to kill the boss (Total time $10+1\cdot2+4=16$)  Move to stage three (Total time $16+3=19$)  Use the laser gun and forced to move to either stage four or two, here we move to stage four (Total time $19+3+3=25$)  Use the pistol once, use AWP to kill the boss (Total time $25+1\cdot1+4=30$)  Move back to stage three (Total time $30+3=33$)  Kill the boss at stage three with the pistol (Total time $33+1=34$)  Note that here, we do not finish at level $n$, but when all the bosses are killed.
