 You are given n towers, number 1 to n, in the row and n numbers 1 to n, each value represents how many blocks are adjacent to that block. 
-----Input----- The first line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers h_1, h_2, ..., h_{n} (1 ≤ h_{i} ≤ 10^9) — sizes of towers. -----Output----- Print the number of operations needed to destroy all towers. -----Examples----- Input 6 2 1 4 6 2 2 Output 3 Input 7 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 Output 2 -----Note----- The picture below shows all three operations for the first sample test. Each time boundary blocks are marked with red color.  [Image]  After first operation there are four blocks left and only one remains after second operation. This last block is destroyed in third operation.
