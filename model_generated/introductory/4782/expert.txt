 In Scala, an underscore may be used to create a partially applied version of an infix operator using placeholder syntax. For example, `(_ * 3)` is a function that multiplies its input by 3. With a bit of manipulation, this idea can be extended to work on any arbitrary expression. Create an value/object named `x` that acts as a placeholder in an arithmetic expression. The placeholder should support the four basic integer arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integral (floor) division. When the expression with placeholders is called, it should fill the placeholders in the expression from left to right
