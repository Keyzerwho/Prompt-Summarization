 You need to make a function that takes an object as an argument, and returns a very similar object but with a special property. The returned object should allow a user to access values by providing only the beginning of the key for the value they want. For example if the given object has a key `idNumber`, you should be able to access its value on the returned object by using a key `idNum` or even simply `id`. `Num` and `Number` shouldn't work because we are only looking for matches at the beginning of a key. Be aware that you _could_ simply add all these partial keys one by one to the object. However, for the sake of avoiding clutter, we don't want to have a JSON with a bunch of nonsensical keys
