 Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has $s$ burles on his card.  Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number $1 \le x \le s$, buy food that costs exactly $x$ burles and obtain $\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor$ burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends $x$ burles and obtains $\lfloor\frac{x}{10}\rfloor$ back). The operation $\lfloor\frac{a}{
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The next $t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer $s$ ($1 \le s \le 10^9$) — the number of burles Mishka initially has. -----Output----- For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally. -----Example----- Input 6 1 10 19 9876 12345 1000000000 Output 1 11 21 10973 13716 1111111111
