 I need some help with my math homework. I have a number of problems I need to return the derivative for. They will all be of the form:   ax^b,   A and B are both integers, but can be positive or negative. Note:    - if b is 1, then the equation will be ax.     - if b is 0, then the equation will be 0.      Examples:   3x^3   -> 9x^2     3x^2   -> 6x     3x     -> 3     3      -> 0     3x
