 Consider the sequence S(n, z) = (1 - z)(z + z**2 + z**3 + ... + z**n) where z is a complex number  and n a positive integer (n > 0). When n goes to infinity and z has a correct value (ie z is in its domain of convergence D), S(n, z) goes to a finite limit lim depending on z. Experiment with S(n,
Examples: I is a complex number such as I * I = -1 (sometimes written `i` or `j`).  `f(0.3 + 0.5 * I, 1e-4) returns 17`    `f(30 + 5 * I, 1e-4) returns -1` # Remark: For languages that don't have complex numbers or "easy" complex numbers, a complex number `z` is represented by two real numbers `x` (real part) and `y` (imaginary part). `f(0.3, 0.5, 1e-4) returns 17`    `f(30, 5, 1e-4) returns -1` # Note: You pass the tests if `abs(actual - exoected) <= 1`
