 You have a n chips. We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to: position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0. position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1. Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.   Example 1: Input: position = [1,2,3] Output: 1 Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position
