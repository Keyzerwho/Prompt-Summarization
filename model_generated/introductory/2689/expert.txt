 You are given an array of object literals holding the current employees of a company.  You code must find the employee with the matching firstName and lastName and then return the role for that employee or if no employee is not found it should return "Does not work here!" The array is preloaded and can be referenced using the variable `employees` (`$employees` in Ruby). It uses the following structure. ```python employees = [ {'first_name': "Dipper", 'last_name': "Pines", 'role': "Boss"}, ...... ] ```
