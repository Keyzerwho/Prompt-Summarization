 You are given a function `quote` that should take two string parameters: a person's name (`name`) and a quote of theirs (`quote`), and return a string attributing the quote to the person in the following format: ```python '[name] said: "[quote]"' ``` Unfortunately, something is wrong with the instructions in the function body. Your job is to fix it so the function returns correctly formatted quotes. Click the "Train" button to get started, and be careful with your quotation marks.
