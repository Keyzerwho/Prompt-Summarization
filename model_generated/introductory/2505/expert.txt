 Two axis-aligned rectangles overlap if they intersect. Two axis-aligned rectangles do not overlap if they only touch at the corners or edges. 
Example 1: Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3] Output: true Example 2: Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1] Output: false Example 3: Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3] Output: false Â  Constraints: rect1.length == 4 rect2.length == 4 -109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109 rec1[0] <= rec1[2] and rec1[1] <= rec1[3] rec2[0] <= rec2[2] and rec2[1] <= rec2[3]
