 A factorial of a number, `n!`, is defined for whole numbers as the product of all integers from `1` to `n`.  For example, `5!` is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120` Most factorial implementations use a recursive function to determine the value of `factorial(n)`. However, this blows up the stack for large values of `n` - most systems cannot handle stack depths much greater than 2000 levels. Write an implementation to calculate the factorial of arbitrarily
