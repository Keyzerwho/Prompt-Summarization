 You're given a string containing a sequence of words separated with whitespaces. Let's say it is a sequence of patterns: a name and a corresponding number - like this: ```"red 1 yellow 2 black 3 white 4"``` You want to turn it into a different **string** of objects you plan to work with later on - like this: ```"[{name : 'red', id : '1'}, {name : 'yellow', id : '2'}, {name : 'black', id : '3'}
