 You are given two positive integers $a$ and $b$. You should find the number of positive integers in this sequence that are in the range $[a,b]$. 
Examples: ``` python odd_dig_cubic(-5000, 5000) == [-3375,-1331, -1, 1, 1331, 3375] # the output should be sorted. odd_dig_cubic(0, 5000) == [1, 1331, 3375] odd_dig_cubic(-1, 5000) == [-1, 1, 1331, 3375] odd_dig_cubic(-5000, -2) == [-3375,-1331] ``` Features of the random tests for python: ``` number of Tests = 94 minimum value for a = -1e17 maximum value for b = 1e17 ``` You do not have to check the entries, ```a``` and ```b``` always integers and ```a < b```  Working well in Python 2 and Python 3. Translation into Ruby is coming soon.
