 You are given a list of positive integers. The odd numbers from the list will fight using their `1` bits from their binary representation, while the even numbers will fight using their `0` bits. If present in the list, number `0` will be neutral, hence not fight for either side. You should return: * `odds win` if number of `1`s from odd numbers is larger than `0`s from even numbers * `evens win` if number of `1`s from odd numbers is smaller than `0`s from even numbers * `tie` if equal, including if
