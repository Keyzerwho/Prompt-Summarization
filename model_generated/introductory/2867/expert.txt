 You are given an array of integers. Your task is to determine the minimum number of its elements that need to be changed so that elements of the array will form an arithmetic progression. Note that if you swap two elements, you're changing both of them, for the purpose of this kata. Here an arithmetic progression is defined as a sequence of integers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. For example, `6 4 2 0 -2` and `3 3 3 3 3` are arithmetic progressions, but `0 0.5 1 1.5` and `1 -1 1
