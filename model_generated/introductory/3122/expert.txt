 You are given a `n   m` chessboard. You are asked to calculate the number of ways to choose positions of the pieces to form a triangle.  Note that the bishop attacks pieces sharing the common diagonal with it; the rook attacks in horizontal and vertical directions; and, finally, the knight attacks squares which are two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away from its position.  ![](https://codefightsuserpics.s3.amazonaws.com/tasks/chessTriangle/img/moves.png _tm=1473934712
