 You are given an integer.  Multiply all the digits of the integer by each other, repeating with the product until a single digit is obtained. The number of steps required is known as the **multiplicative persistence**. Create a function that calculates the individual results of each step, not including the original number, but including the single digit, and outputs the result as a list/array. If the input is a single digit, return an empty list/array. ## Examples ``` per(1)  = [] per(10) = [0] // 1*0 = 0 per(69)
