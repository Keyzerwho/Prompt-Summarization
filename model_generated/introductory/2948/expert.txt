 Given an array, rearrange the elements such that all elements that are less than `k` are placed before elements that are not less than `k`; all elements that are less than `k` remain in the same order with respect to each other; all elements that are not less than `k` remain in the same order with respect to each other. For `k` = 6 and `elements = [6, 4, 10, 10, 6]`, the output should be `splitByValue(6, elements) = [4, 6, 10, 10,
