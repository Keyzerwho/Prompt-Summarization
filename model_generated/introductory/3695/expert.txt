 You are given a string `s`. Let's call its substring a group, if all letters in it are adjacent and the same(such as `"aa","bbb","cccc"`..). Let's call the substiring with 2 or more adjacent group a big group(such as `"aabb","bbccc"`...).    Your task is to count the number of `big groups` in the given string.
