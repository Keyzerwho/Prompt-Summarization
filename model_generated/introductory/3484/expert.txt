 This kata requires you to convert minutes (`int`) to hours and minutes in the format `hh:mm` (`string`). If the input is `0` or negative value, then you should return `"00:00"`. ## Example If the input is `78`, then you should return `"01:18"`, because 78 minutes converts to 1 hour and 18 minutes. Good luck! :D
