 consider X as the aleatory variable that count the number of letters in a word. Write a function that, give in input an array of words (strings), calculate the variance of X. Max decimal of the variance : 4. Some wiki: Variance ,  Aleatory variable  Example: consider "Hello" and "World": X is { 5 } with P(X = 5) = 1 beacuse the two words has the same length.   So E[X] = 5 x 1 =
