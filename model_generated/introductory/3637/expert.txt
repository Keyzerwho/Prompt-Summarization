 Given an array, count the number of duplicates in it. Duplicates are represented with 'X's. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid array, made of only duplicates or empty slots. Duplicates can only be horizontal or vertical. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two duplicates - there are no adjacent duplicates. Example: X..X ...X ...X In the above array there are 2 duplicates
