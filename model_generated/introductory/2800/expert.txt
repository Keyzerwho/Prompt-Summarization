 Given two bearings, find how long it will take for the straight-line distance between the ships to reach 40 miles. Both ships travel at 90 miles per hour. At time 0, assume the ships have the same location. Bearings are defined as degrees from north, counting clockwise. These will be passed to your function as integers between 0 and 359 degrees. Round your result to 2 decimal places. If the net never breaks, return float('inf')
