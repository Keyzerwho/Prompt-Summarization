 In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation. Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this: josephus_survivor(7,3) => means 7 people in a circle; one every 3 is eliminated until one remains [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence [1,2,4,5,6,7] =>
