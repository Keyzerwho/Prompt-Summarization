 Given two integers n and m, denoting the number of rows and columns respectively, find out the direction you will be facing at the end. Output `"L"` for left, `"R"` for right, `"U"` for up, and `"D"` for down. Example:  For `n = 3, m = 3`, the output should be `"R"`.  This example refers to the picture given in the description. At the end of your walk you will be standing in the middle of the grid facing right.
