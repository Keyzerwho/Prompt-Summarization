 You are given an array of prime factors. Find the integer to which the prime factors belong. Then, generate the divisors of that number. Your function ```get_num() or getNum()``` will receive an array with potentially unordered prime factors and should output: an array with the found integer n at index 0, the amount of total divisors (both prime and compound numbers) at index 1, followed the smallest factor (index 2, and the biggest one (last element) We will see the example given above with the only difference that the array of the prime
