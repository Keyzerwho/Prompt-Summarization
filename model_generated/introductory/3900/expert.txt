 Your task is to accept an integer in the range `0 - 999999` and print it as a string (in decimal format), with each digit being represented as its own seven segment display (6x seven segment displays in total). Each of the individual led segments per display should be represented by three hashes `###`. Vertical bars `|` (ASCII 124) represent the edges of each display, with a single whitespace on either side between the edge and the area of the led segments. An example of the expected output is shown below: ``` segment_display(123456) =  |       |
