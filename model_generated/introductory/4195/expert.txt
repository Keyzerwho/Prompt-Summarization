  * Implement a function that models the process of merging all of the tile values in a single row.  * This function takes the array line as a parameter and returns a new array with the tile values from line slid towards the front of the array (index 0) and merged.  * A given tile can only merge once.  * Empty grid squares are represented as zeros.  * Your function should work on arrays containing arbitrary number of elements.
