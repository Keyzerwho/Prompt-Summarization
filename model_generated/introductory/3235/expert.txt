 In genetics a reading frame is a way to divide a sequence of nucleotides (DNA bases) into a set of consecutive non-overlapping triplets (also called codon). Each of this triplets is translated into an amino-acid during a translation process to create proteins. Your task is to decompose a single strand DNA into 3 reading frames. For the output we are going to take the combinations and show them in the following manner: For frame 1 split all of them in groups of three starting by the first base (letter). For frame 2 split all of them in groups of three starting by the second base (letter) but having the first base (
