 You are given a string (x) featuring a cat 'C', a dog 'D' and a mouse 'm'. The rest of the string will be made up of '.'.  You need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from it's current position. The cat can jump (j) characters.  Also, the cat cannot jump over the dog. So: if j = 5: ```..C.....m.``` returns 'Caught!'  <-- not more than j characters between ```.....C............m......``` returns 'Escaped!'
