 Your task is to build a model^(1) which can predict y-coordinate. You can pass tests if predicted y-coordinates are inside error margin. You will receive train set which should be used to build a model. After you build a model tests will call function ```predict``` and pass x to it. Error is going to be calculated with RMSE. Blocked libraries: sklearn, pandas, tensorflow, numpy, scipy
