 Given an array of ones and zeros that represents a positive binary number convert the number to two's complement value. Two's complement is the way most computers represent positive or negative integers. The most significant bit is negative.  Examples: -8 4 2 1  [1,1,1,1] = -1 [1,0,0,0] = -8 [1,1,0,1] = -3 To get the two's complement negative notation of an integer, you take the number in binary.  You then invert the digits, and add
