 Your task is to return the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix. A prefix is the start of a string while the suffix is the end of a string.  For instance, the prefixes of the string `"abcd"` are `["a","ab","abc"]`. The suffixes are `["bcd", "cd", "d"]`. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.
