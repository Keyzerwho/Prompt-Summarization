 =====Problem Statement===== You are given a number X. You need to output the sum of multiples of X upto N. 
=====Input Format===== The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there are 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains n, the number of cubes. The second line contains n space separated integers, denoting the sideLengths of each cube in that order.  =====Constraints===== 1≤T≤5 1≤n≤10^5 1≤sideLength≤2^31 =====Output Format===== For each test case, output a single line containing either "Yes" or "No" without the quotes.
