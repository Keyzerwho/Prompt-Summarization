 Given an integer `n`. Determine whether it can be split into two primes. If yes, return the maximum product of two primes. If not, return `0` instead.   
Example For `n = 1`, the output should be `0`. `1` can not split into two primes For `n = 4`, the output should be `4`. `4` can split into two primes `2 and 2`. `2 x 2 = 4` For `n = 20`, the output should be `91`. `20` can split into two primes `7 and 13` or `3 and 17`. The maximum product is `7 x 13 = 91`
