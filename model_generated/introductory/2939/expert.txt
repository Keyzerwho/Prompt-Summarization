 Create a function ```python has_two_cube_sums(n) ``` which checks if a given number `n` can be written as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: `n = a +b  = c +d `. All the numbers `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` should be different and greater than `0`. E.g. 1729 = 9 +10  = 1 +12 . ```python has_two_cube_sums(1729
