 You are given two entities A and B and their positions are represented by integer coordinates on a horizantal line. The first position $x$ and a second position $y$. The Entity A moves in the positive direction by $a$, and the entity b moves to the negative direction by $b$. For example, let's say $x=0$, $y=10$, $a=2$, and $b=3$. At the $1$-st second, entities will be at position $2$ and $7$. At the $2
