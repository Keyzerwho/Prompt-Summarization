 Given an amount of grains, you need to return up to which square of the chessboard one should count in order to get at least as many. As usual, a few examples might be way better than thousands of words from me: ```python squares_needed(0) == 0 squares_needed(1) == 1 squares_needed(2) == 2 squares_needed(3) == 2 squares_needed(4) == 3 ``` Input is always going to be valid/reasonable: ie: a non negative number; extra cookie for *not* using a loop to compute
