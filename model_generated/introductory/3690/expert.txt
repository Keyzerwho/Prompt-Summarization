 You are given a string with brackets and an index of an opening bracket and your task will be to return the index of the matching closing bracket.  Both the input and returned index are 0-based **except in Fortran where it is 1-based**. An opening brace will always have a closing brace. Return `-1` if there is no answer (in Haskell, return `Nothing`; in Fortran, return `0`; in Go, return an error)
