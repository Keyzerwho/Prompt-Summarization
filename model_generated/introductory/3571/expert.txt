 You are given two numbers X and Y. In one step, you can either double the value of X, or decrement X by 1. Return the minimum number of steps required before the value of X equals Y.   Example 1: Input: X = 2, Y = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}. Example 2: Input: X = 5, Y = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 ->
