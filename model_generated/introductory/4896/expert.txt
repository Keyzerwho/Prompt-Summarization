 The goal of this kata is to implement [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) (or prefix tree) using dictionaries (aka hash maps or hash tables), where: 1. the dictionary keys are the prefixes 2. the value of a leaf node is `None` in Python, `nil` in Ruby and `null` in Groovy, JavaScript and Java. 3. the value for empty input is `{}` in Python, Ruby, Javascript and Java (empty map) and `[:]` in Groovy
