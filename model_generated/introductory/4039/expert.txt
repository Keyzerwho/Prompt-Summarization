 # Fourier transformations are hard. Fouriest transformations are harder. This Kata is based on the SMBC Comic on fourier transformations. A fourier transformation on a number is one that converts the number to a base in which it has more `4`s ( `10` in base `6` is `14`, which has `1` four as opposed to none, hence, fourier in base `6` ). A number's fouriest transformation converts it to the base in which it has the most `4`s.   For example: `35353` is the fouriest in
