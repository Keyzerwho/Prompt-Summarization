 You are given the lengths AB and BC. Your task is to find ANGLE{MBC} (angle   , as shown in the figure) in degrees.
=====Input Format===== The first contains the length of side AB. The second line contains the length of side BC. =====Constraints===== 0<AB≤100 0<BC≤100 Lengths AB and BC are natural numbers. =====Output Format===== Output ANGLE{MBC} in degrees. Note: Round the angle to the nearest integer. Examples: If angle is 56.5000001°, then output 57°. If angle is 56.5000000°, then output 57°. If angle is 56.4999999°, then output 56°.
