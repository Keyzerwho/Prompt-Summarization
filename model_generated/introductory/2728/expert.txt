 You are given two positive integers a and n. a and n should be co-prime to have a solution, if it is not the case, you should return None (Python), nil (Ruby) or null (Javascript).  a and n will be positive integers. The problem can easily be generalised to negative integer with some sign changes so we won't deal with them.
