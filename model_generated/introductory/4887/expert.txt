 You are given a date (March 24, 2437) and the number of days ($d$) to travel back in time. Your task is to calculate the number of days until March 24, 2437. For example, if a historical newspaper says a dangerous baby was born on: Date = 21, Month = 3, Year = 2437 Then your function must compute that it was 3 Days ago. Another example would be that a baby born on Date = 24, Month = 3, Year = 2436 would have been born 365 days ago
