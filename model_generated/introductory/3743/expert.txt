 A grid is a perfect starting point for many games (Chess, battleships, Candy Crush!). Making a digital chessboard I think is an interesting way of visualising how loops can work together. Your task is to write a function that takes two integers `rows` and `columns` and returns a chessboard pattern as a two dimensional array. So `chessBoard(6,4)` should return an array like this:     [             ["O","X","O","X"],             ["X","O"
