 You are required to implement a function `find_nth_occurrence` that returns the index of the nth occurrence of a substring within a string (considering that those substring could overlap each others). If there are less than n occurrences of the substring, return -1. # Example ```python string = "This is an example. Return the nth occurrence of example in this example string." find_nth_occurrence("example", string, 1) == 11 find_nth_occurrence("example", string, 2
