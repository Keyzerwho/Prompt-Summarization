 A entity can have some specialization: A or B. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time. You need to form a team. So the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one A, at least one B and it consists of exactly three entities. You know that $c$ of the students are specialised in A, $m$ are in B and $x$ have no specialization. What is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into   Note that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team. You are also asked to answer $q$ independent queries. 
-----Input----- The first line of the input contains one integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries. The first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of candies. Then $n$ lines follow, each containing two integers $a_i$ and $f_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$, $0 \le f_i \le 1$), where $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th candy, and $f_i$ denotes whether you want to keep the $i$-th candy for yourself ($0$ if you want to keep it, $1$ if you don't mind giving it away). It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all queries does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. -----Output----- For each query print two integers:   the maximum number of candies in a gift you can compose, according to the constraints in the statement;  the maximum number of candies having $f_i = 1$ in a gift you can compose that contains the maximum possible number of candies.   -----Example----- Input 3 8 1 0 4 1 2 0 4 1 5 1 6 1 3 0 2 0 4 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 9 2 0 2 0 4 1 4 1 4 1 7 0 7 1 7 0 7 1 Output 3 3 3 3 9 5 -----Note----- In the first query, you can include two candies of type $4$ and one candy of type $5$. All of them have $f_i = 1$ and you don't mind giving them away as part of the gift.
